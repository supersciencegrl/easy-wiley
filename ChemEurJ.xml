         <title>Steric Restraints in Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligands and Their Impact on Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One carbon makes the difference; a diguandine with an ethylene bridge does not coordinate metals, while a diguanidine with a propylene bridge coordinates to a variety of metals. In this work, we report the synthesis and coordination chemistry of the first cyclic diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands and compare their coordination chemistry with that of open diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands.








Abstract
The introduction of redox&#8208;active ligands into coordination compounds is attractive for a number of applications; intramolecular electron transfer between a redox&#8208;active ligand and a metal is the basis for applications in switchable devices and advanced redox catalysis for multielectron substrate activations. A fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of redox&#8208;active ligands focusses on the redox potential and frontier orbital energies, as well as the steric demand and coordination mode. In this work, we report the first synthesis of new o&#8208;diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands in which the two guanidino groups are connected through an alkyl chain of different length. The introduction of an ethylene bridge between the two guanidino groups turns a strongly coordinating ligand into a noncoordinating molecule, while keeping its strong Br&#248;nsted basicity. These features qualify the ethylene&#8208;bridged compound as a powerful alternative to Huenig's base, diisopropyl&#8208;ethyl&#8208;amine. The change from an ethylene to a propylene bridge switches back on the coordination ability. It is also possible to introduce a methyl group to the central C atom of the propylene bridge without loss of nucleophilic properties. The analysis, based on a variety of metal complexes, identifies three structural parameters to assay the structural restraint. Macrocyclic tetraguanidines are also formed.

         <title>Reversible and Massive Structural Transformation in Meltable Cyanido&#8208;bridged Coordination Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melting crystals containing separated domains of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and K2Cu3(CN)5 were obtained via simple dehydration of K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Their low melting point of 559&#160;K resulted from the combined effects of strong crystal&#8208;interface interactions and low&#8208;coordinate Cu nodes.








Abstract
Cyanido (CN&#8722;)&#8208;bridged coordination polymers (CP) have been extensively studied as molecular&#8208;based functional materials. However, synthesizing 3D compounds composed only of metal ions and CN&#8722;&#8212;without bulky organic groups&#8212;and that melt before decomposing remains a considerable challenge. This difficulty arises because CN&#8722; strongly interconnect metal ions, forming rigid, dense frameworks with high melting points. In this study, we successfully synthesized a melting composite consisting of 3D KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and 2D K2Cu3(CN)5 by dehydrating K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Remarkably, nanodomains of these two compounds coexisted within single particles, allowing their crystal structures to be independently determined by 3D electron diffraction (MicroED) of the resulting powders. Each compound melted at its respective melting point, around 559&#160;K. Notably, the melting point of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 is unusually low for a 3D dense coordination framework. This atypically low melting point results from a combination of crystalline surface effects, and the entropy contribution of the dynamic, labile two&#8208;coordinate Cu centers in the framework. Additionally, we demonstrated a reversible transformation between the dehydrated mixture and the hydrated parent compound through exposure to water vapor, highlighting the dynamic and responsive nature of these CN&#8722;&#8208;based solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenation of Primary Amines to Nitriles: Hydrogen Release in Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>

Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands catalyze the double dehydrogenation of primary amines, presenting their role in hydrogen production and storage using amine/nitrile pairs as LOHCs.








Abstract
The synthesis of new Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands and their role in hydrogen production and storage via dehydrogenation using amine/nitrile pairs as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is presented. The substrate scope includes aliphatic (including the long&#8208;chain amines) as well as aromatic primary amines. Various biologically important amines were also applicable to this dehydrogenation process, such as furfurylamine, 3&#8208;picolylamine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;methanamine, tryptamine, and 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylamine. Control experiments, detailed concentration&#8208;dependent, and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic studies were carried out, including a Hammett plot. A plausible mechanism for acceptorless double dehydrogenation of primary amines is also proposed on the basis of these analyses, suggesting the presence of Ru&#8208;H species. The catalyst's recyclability was tested up to 5 cycles without showing any significant drop in the product yield.

         <title>Hybrid Nanostructures by Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 and WS2 with C60 Undergoing Excited Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 nanohybrids via rapid covalent functionalization with a modified C60. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent solubility in various solvents and enable efficient electron transfer, forming MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; species, thus highlighting their potential for light energy harvesting.








Abstract
In this contribution, we report the formation, characterization, and photophysical assessment of hybrid nanostructures realized via a rapid and straightforward covalent functionalization reaction between MoS2 or WS2 and a modified C60 bearing a 1,2&#8208;dithiolane chain. Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis confirmed that the resulting hybrids are homogeneous at the nanoscale level, effectively suppressing undesired fullerene&#8211;fullerene aggregation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy evidenced the covalent connection between the two species, and thermogravimetry determined the loading of C60 onto MoS2 or WS2. The MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 hybrids were stable in liquid media, forming homogeneous inks, which enabled the investigation of thermodynamically feasible, excitonic electron transfer resulting in the formation of MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; radical ion pairs by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The measured rates were found to be 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for MoS2&#8211;C60 and 3.50&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, respectively, revealing their potential as light energy harvesting materials.

         <title>Carbon and Heteroatom Activation via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Bound Dearomative Intermediates for Stereoselective Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to activate carbon and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds is reviewed based on key dearomative NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, i.e., ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), aza&#8208;fulvene and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates. Their formation and reactivity in stereoselective annulation reactions for the synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)cyclic molecules are discussed.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has long been recognized as a powerful and versatile method for the implementation of (asymmetric) transformations enabling the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds. A number of NHC&#8208;bound active ionic species have been classically established for activation of carbon atoms as either nucleophiles or electrophiles at diverse positions, such as (aza)Breslow intermediates, homoenolate equivalents, azolium (di)enolates, simple acyl (imidoyl) azoliums, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated/alkynyl acyl azoliums. Within this realm, the past decade has witnessed a blossoming interest in the deployment of NHC&#8208;tethered dearomative intermediates for the activation of both carbon atoms and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds. Accordingly, functionalization of benzylic carbon atoms was made possible through catalyst&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), while remote activation of oxygen and nitrogen atoms was effectively achieved through NHC&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), along with aza&#8208;fulvene type intermediates and triaza&#8208;diene species. Aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most relevant literature on the development of NHC&#8208;bound dearomative intermediates for carbon and heteroatom activation since 2013, with emphasis on their applications for stereoselective annulation reactions.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Glycomacrocycles: Synthesis, Photoisomerization, and Photomodulation of Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with Helix Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic glycoazobenzenes: Four new azobenzene&#8208;functionalized glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized. These photoswitchable chiral macrocycles behave as chiral dopants of NLCs, with an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of HTP at Z&#8208;rich state. Critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior has been demonstrated. Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.








Abstract
Novel azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), then applied for cholesteric liquid crystal photomodulation. All the macrocycles displayed good photochromic properties, fatigue resistance, thermal bistability, and chiroptical activity. As chiral dopants for nematic liquid crystal (NLC), an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power (HTP) at Z&#8208;rich state have been observed. We also demonstrated the critical influence of sugar&#8208;ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Advancing Bidirectional Photoswitching of Norbornadienes: Exclusively Light&#8208;Induced Interconversion of Imide&#8208; and Ortho&#8208;Connected Norbornadiene&#8208;Perylene Diimide Hybrids</title>

         <dc:description>
Bidirectional Photoswitching: We report norbornadiene&#8208;perylene diimide (NBD&#8208;PDI) dyads with diverse connectivities, enabling exclusively photoinduced NBD/QC switching. Our findings reveal high conversion yields in both directions, paired with good thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. Rapid back&#8208;isomerization to NBD occurs upon visible light irradiation, highlighting the potential for on&#8208;demand energy release in energy storage applications.








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch is a promising candidate for molecular solar energy storage. Isomerization to the energy&#8208;storing, metastable QC occurs upon UV light irradiation, while the back&#8208;switching can be triggered in various ways. However, inducing complete, on&#8208;demand energy release across multiple switching cycles remains a significant challenge in molecular solar thermal (MOST) research. We demonstrate the implementation of perylene diimide (PDI) as covalently connected, photoactive redox&#8208;catalyst to enable NBD regeneration upon 475&#160;nm irradiation. We investigated the NBD/QC interconversion of several imide&#8208; and ortho&#8208;connected NBD&#8208;PDI hybrids upon irradiation at 310&#160;nm and 475&#160;nm, revealing that the connection position on PDI only minimally affects the interconversion efficiency. Concentration&#8208;dependent studies identified an alternative intermolecular back&#8208;isomerization mechanism in addition to the previously known intramolecular pathway, for which adequate flexibility of the linker proved crucial for effective back&#8208;isomerization to NBD. This study advances the exclusively photoinduced isomerization of the NBD/QC system within novel NBD&#8208;PDI dyads, establishing a framework for the targeted manipulation of NBD hybrids with potential application in energy storage. The presented switches operate independently, without the need for further additives to facilitate interconversion, which renders them promising candidates for molecular solar energy storage research.

         <title>Tuning the Excited State Character of Amine/Carbonyl Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Ring Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring fusion in MR&#8208;TADF emitters can affect the charge transfer excited state and therefore the photophysical properties. Here we investigate the effect of ring fusion in two structurally similar molecules to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters exhibit short&#8208;range charge transfer (SRCT) and have narrow emission, whereas donor&#8208;acceptor TADF emitters show long&#8208;range charge transfer (LRCT) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). While some work has been done to create intermediate&#8208;type materials with narrow emission and rapid RISC simultaneously, no studies of structurally comparable donor&#8208;acceptor versus MR&#8208;TADF systems have been described. Here we report two TADF emitters, Acr&#8208;DiKTa and Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa, to examine the effect of ring fusion on LRCT and SRCT character. Acr&#8208;DiKTa appends an acridone moiety to quinolino[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine&#8208;5,9&#8208;dione to create a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type structure, while a carbonyl bridge fuses these moieties in Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa to give an MR&#8208;TADF structure. Acr&#8208;DiKTa emits blue&#8208;green in toluene with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 38&#160;nm whereas Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa emits green&#8208;yellow with a FWHM of 34&#160;nm. Calculated orbital distributions show SRCT in the first excited state for both compounds. Both compounds are TADF active in doped films, and derived rate constants show that RISC is four times more rapid in Acr&#8208;DiKTa. This study shows that while ring fusion enhances color purity, donor&#8208;acceptor structures can achieve comparable FWHMs and rapid RISC through dominant SRCT supported by LRCT for best performance in TADF materials.

         <title>Effects of Peripheral Substituents on the Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with substituents on the meso and/or &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons were prepared, and their optical and electrochemical properties were revealed. The peripheral substituents were found to exert significant impacts on the fluorescence property and aggregation behavior of the DBTriAP chromophore in solution.








Abstract
In contrast to the great advances of phthalocyanine&#8208;based materials, the potential of 5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins has not been realized because of the lack of fundamental information about their structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we report new derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with aryl or alkyl substituents at the meso and/or &#946; positions. Freebases of DBTriAP were prepared by the condensation of two types of 1,9&#8208;dibromodipyrrins with 1,3&#8208;diiminoisoindoline and subsequent functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons. Zinc(II) complexes of DBTriAP were obtained by complexation of the corresponding freebases with zinc(II) acetate. The optical and electrochemical properties of the DBTriAP derivatives were studied by steady&#8208;state and transient ultraviolet/visible absorption/emission spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Replacing the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic hydrogens of the 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;DBTriAP derivatives with aryl groups resulted in substantial red shifts of the low&#8208;energy absorption band because of the effective &#960;&#8208;delocalization and/or charge&#8208;transfer interaction with the DBTriAP chromophore. The 2,3,17,18&#8208;tetraethyl&#8208;DBTriAP freebase exhibited split redox processes in its cyclic voltammogram, suggesting the rapid formation of a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer radical cation facilitated by the highly planar structure. Most of the DBTriAP derivatives emitted red fluorescence with quantum yields of 0.07&#8211;0.31, indicating their potential as luminescent materials.

         <title>Effects of Isomorphous Substitution on Photophysical and Magnetic Properties of Complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Y3+, Ho3+, and Er3+)</title>

We present the research on the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] with Dy3+, Ho3+, and Er3+ ions and the solid solutions [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] based on them. The investigated materials exhibited multifunctionality: they absorb light in the UV, visible, and NIR range; emit in the visible and NIR range; demonstrate weak magnetic interactions; and possess exceptional thermal stability.








Abstract
This work encompasses the study of magnetic, optical, and structural properties of the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln &#9472; Ho3+, Er3+, Dy3+, and Y3+; MeDPQ &#8722; 2&#8208;methyldipyrido&#8208;[3,2&#8208;f:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;quinoxaline) and substituted complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ho3+, Er3+, and Y3+) based on them. Magnetic measurements within the range 5&#8211;300&#160;K revealed single ion anisotropy in [Dy(MeDPQ)2Cl3], with the Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature &#952; being &#8722;3.69&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;K. Complexes of Ho3+ and Er3+ exhibited f&#8211;f emission in the visible range, while the latter was also emissive in the NIR. Dilution of the Dy3+ complex with diamagnetic Y3+ ions resulted in alterations of magnetic and photophysical properties. The substituted complexes Y0.5Dy0.5 and Y0.9Dy0.1 demonstrated paramagnetic behavior, with &#952; being 3.06&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12&#160;K and 9.64&#160;&#177;&#160;0.23&#160;K, respectively. In both cases, the emission decay times of Dy3+ changed insignificantly, 21.02&#160;&#177;&#160;0.41 &#181;s and 14.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22 &#181;s, respectively, compared to the value (18.92&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 &#181;s) of the individual Dy3+ complex. Additional ligand&#8208;based emission bands were observed in the Ho3+ and Er3+ complexes at room temperature and 77&#160;K and in the substituted complexes Ho0.5Dy0.5 and Er0.5Dy0.5 at room temperature, which were assigned to the exciplex states. The thermal stability of [Er0.5Dy0.5(MeDPQ)2Cl3] was determined to be the same as for the individual complexes, starting to oxidize at 410&#176;C.

Mixed alkali metals, potassium and additional&#160;rubidium or cesium, allow for the synthesis of a straightforward, electron&#8208;precise Zintl phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5. The new phase is characterized by SCXRD, PXRD, and DFT. Its metastability is proven by DSC measurements. Dissolution experiments in liquid ammonia show the oxidation of K7&#8722;xAxTl5 to elemental thallium, while 205Tl NMR allowed for the detection of the first signal derived by dissolution of a thallide in liquid ammonia.








Abstract
In alkali metal thallides, a huge variety of thallium clusters can be realized, which are surrounded only by alkali metals. In most cases, different cluster types are present in the crystal structures at the same time. One example is the [Tl5]7&#8722; trigonal bipyramid, which has only been observed beside [Tl9]9&#8722;, [Tl4]8&#8722;, [Tl3]7&#8722;, [Tl]5&#8722;, or [Tl8Cd3]10&#8722;. In the new ternary alkali metal thallide phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5 (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2.35), exclusively [Tl5]7&#8722; clusters are present, and the compound can be described as a salt&#8208;like Zintl&#8208;phase, where the electron count is balanced in terms of the anionic moiety and counter cations. This phase crystallizes in the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric space group Ama2. Different temperature programs applied during synthesis suggested metastability, which was subsequently proven by DSC measurements. DFT calculations reveal a minimum in the DOS at EF and support the salt&#8208;like description. Dissolution experiments in the style of well&#8208;known group 14 and group 15 solution chemistry in liquid ammonia were performed and showed oxidation of the alkali metal thallide. Initial 205Tl NMR studies in liquid ammonia allow for the detection of the first signal of a dissolved thallium species emerging from a thallide Zintl phase.

         <title>London Dispersion versus Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond in Bis&#8208;Pyridines: How Accurate Is DFT for Competing Noncovalent Interactions in the Condensed Phase?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A test system of 14 singly protonated bis&#8209;pyridine salts, with varying H&#8209;bonded and London dispersion interactions, was designed to systematically study non&#8209;covalent interactions across the gas, solution, and solid phases. A good correlation between the 1H chemical shift and the N&#8208;H&#8211;N angle from the crystal structures was established. We observed systematic discrepancies in the treatment of these interactions by DFT&#8209;D3/D4 across the phases.








Abstract
We report a systematic investigation of noncovalent interactions&#8212;particularly an intramolecular hydrogen bond and London Dispersion forces&#8212;in singly protonated bis&#8208;pyridines, studied across solution and crystalline states. Building on our previous gas&#8208;phase study, we combine variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The measured 1H NMR chemical shifts of the acidic proton serve as a solution&#8208;phase structural readout, which we correlate with an independent crystallographic metric. By systematically varying the linker (&#8211;CH2&#8211;, &#8211;O&#8211;, and &#8211;CH2CH2&#8211;) and the pendant substituents (H, methyl, tert&#8208;butyl), we examine how increasingly bulky &#8220;dispersion energy donors&#8221; affect both the intramolecular hydrogen bond and the accessible conformational states. In reference systems, where a single noncovalent interaction governs the geometry, even relatively simple computational models correctly reproduce the experimentally observed structures. However, for molecules featuring two competing noncovalent interactions, the tested, dispersion&#8208;corrected, DFT often fails to predict the relative energies of accessible conformers accurately, highlighting current limitations in predictive accuracy. We briefly discuss broader implications of currently achievable predictive accuracy for homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Front Cover: Deep Learning for Hyperpolarized NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Without Resolution Loss: Access to Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>

Water down a mill race is a metaphor for our application of deep learning networks to process NMR spectra. The blue water peaks at the top of the waterfall represent the signals obtained through hyperpolarized water. They display high intensity but lack resolution due to the nature of hyperpolarization. The mill wheel, representing the deep learning network, refines the broad water signals. This is illustrated by the intense sharp white peaks visible downstream. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Kurzbach and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502067).

         <title>Catalyst Design and Mechanistic Insights for Non&#8208;Thermal Plasma Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we systematically explore the enhancement pathways of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis and deeply analyze the unique mechanism of action of various catalyst design strategies, such as shielding protection, defect engineering, local electric field enhancement, and antenna/size effect, in the plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis system. Based on the latest research progress in plasma ammonia synthesis, we comprehensively evaluate the technological routes of emerging plasma ammonia synthesis systems and suggest feasible directions for future research in this field.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage technology based on ammonia carriers is a key part of the transition from fossil fuels to low&#8208;carbon energy sources. However, the high energy consumption and high carbon path dependency of the traditional ammonia industry are the core challenges constraining the development of current technologies. In this review, we focus on the core advantages of low&#8208;temperature plasma chemistry in ammonia synthesis, including mild conditions, environmental friendliness, flexibility, and controllability. We then propose a powerful approach for transitioning traditional ammonia synthesis technology in a sustainable direction. Firstly, we systematically sort out the time evolution of the plasma ammonia synthesis reactor and elucidate the mode of action of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis. In particular, we provide an in&#8208;depth analysis of design optimization strategies for plasma catalysts to explore key catalytic mechanisms in ammonia synthesis systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance index of the existing plasma ammonia synthesis system and suggest feasible directions for future research to further improve the energy efficiency of the technology, promoting the development of the ammonia production process in a more sustainable and advanced direction.

         <title>Carbon Dots as Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts: A Green Tool for Indole and Heteroarenes Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;photocatalytic method for the functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes is reported. The reaction is promoted by the photocatalytic activity of carbon nanodots, which was thoroughly investigated by mechanistic studies to determine the reaction mechanism. The developed procedure allowed for the preparation of alkylated heteroarenes with good yields (up to 88%), with good functional group tolerance, with the possibility to recycle the nanocatalysts up to 5 times without hindering the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Taking into account the hurdles of climate change and environmental pollution, through the years, the development of sustainable protocols in catalysis stands as a cornerstone to answer those issues. Carbon dots (CDs) have recently proven to be efficient in various types of catalysis, including photocatalytic reactions, while being a green and economic alternative for metal catalysts. In this paper, we present a new catalytic system for the photoredox functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes derivatives based on CDs as nano&#8208;photocatalysts. This reaction, based on the cooperation between our catalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine, shows the ability to functionalize these compounds up to 88%, it is effective on 1&#160;mmol scale, and shows a recyclability potential at least to 5 cycles. This system also demonstrated the capacity of obtaining rare types on indoles, having two electron withdrawing groups (EWG), both on the carbon 2 (C2) and carbon 3 (C3). Furthermore, careful studies led to the partial resolution of the mechanism, and to explanations on the regioselectivity of the reaction, which has been studied through the nature of both reagents and substrates, but also through the light's wavelength used in the reaction.

         <title>GCI&#8208;Based Affinity Screening of Synthetic Oligomannosides toward Concanavalin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a reliable GCI method for the affinity determination of neo&#8208;glycoproteins toward concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin. The final goal is to investigate multivalent carbohydrate&#8211;lectin interactions.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first application of grating&#8208;coupled interferometry (GCI) to quantify the binding affinity of synthetically defined mannose&#8208;based neo&#8208;glycoproteins to Concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin for carbohydrate recognition. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;saccharides were conjugated to carrier proteins to create multivalent ligands in a structurally defined yet heterogeneous format. Unlike free sugars, which can interact with lectins in multiple orientations, conjugation constrains sugar presentation and provides a more realistic proxy of how glycans are encountered in glycoconjugates. This approach enabled a systematic comparison of sugar epitopes, confirming that Man(&#945;1,2)Man motif shows stronger binding than Man(&#945;1,6), and that the trisaccharide displays the highest affinity. Notably, the multivalent display of these relatively simple sugar motifs resulted in affinities comparable to or higher than those of natural glycoproteins, highlighting the contribution of valency and presentation rather than glycan complexity. Dissociation constants measured by GCI are consistent with literature values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other methods, confirming the reliability of this platform. This work establishes GCI as a reliable tool for affinity profiling of glycoconjugates and highlights the value of a simple and reproducible screening strategy for evaluating structure&#8211;affinity relationships of glycans in a presentation format closer to their intended applications.

         <title>Batch Synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate Anti&#8208;Malarial Drug</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the WHO, a child under the age of five dies every 2 minutes from malaria in Africa. It is therefore paramount that access and availability of anti&#8208;malarial drugs must be improved. We report a process for the synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate, where key intermediates were obtained in a much shorter reaction time compared to processes reported in literature.








Abstract
An improved three&#8208;step synthesis route toward Primaquine Diphosphate is reported herein. The anti&#8208;malarial drug was obtained via n&#8208;alkylation of readily available potassium phthalimide, followed by reductive amination and room temperature methylaminolysis&#8208;assisted phthalimido deprotection of the key intermediates to furnish Primaquine Diphosphate in 47% overall isolated yield.

         <title>Reactivity of Square Planar Pt(II) Complexes Toward Acidic Moieties as H+, M+, and [ML]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the fact that Pt(II) in square&#8208;planar complexes exhibits Lewis basic properties toward electrophilic species (E&#8314;), the presence of oxygen atoms acting as competing Lewis basic sites leads to the formation of Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Pt or Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314; type complexes, in which no direct metal&#8211;metal bonds are observed. The formation of analogous species with either H&#8314; or [M&#8211;L]&#8314; fragments can be connected to the concept of isolobality between these electrophilic entities.








Abstract
The Lewis base (LB) properties of the d8 Pt(II) are manifested in the formation of Pt&#8594;E species, where E are electrophiles such as acidic hydrogens or metal cations. Thus, the reactions of [Pt(CNC)(dmso)] (CNC&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;di(phen&#8208;2&#8208;ide)&#8208;pyridine) toward PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COOH) or PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;OH) produce complexes [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COO)}] (1) and [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;O)}] (2). Their X&#8208;ray structures confirm the proton transfer from the OH at the phosphane to one of the phenylene rings of the CNC ligand. Then, the deprotonated oxygen occupies the vacant site. It is proposed that the transfer starts with a hydrogen bond (Pt&#8594;H) which evolves to the final products favored by the planar nature of the CNC ligand. 1 and 2 react with Ag+ and [M(PPh3)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) giving rise to complexes without Pt&#9472;M bonds, but O&#9472;M or O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O instead. Their structures reveal that the oxygen atoms present in 1 and 2 advantageously compete with the Pt as the donor entity for the incoming acidic metal. Moreover, dinuclear complexes with O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O systems structurally analogous to the O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O have been prepared and characterized. They reinforce the idea of resemblance of the proton and cations such as Ag+, Au+, [AgL]+, and [AuL]+ as Lewis acidic moieties, which is consistent with the concept of isolobality.

A pulsed high&#8208;temperature microreactor coupled with VUV PI Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS was used to study the C6H5&#160;+&#160;C2H2 reaction via the HACA mechanism. Key products (C4H4, C6H5, C6H5C2H, C10H8, etc.) were detected in a molecular beam. At 800&#8211;1200&#160;K and 100&#8211;600&#160;Torr, the main products were phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) and naphthalene (C10H8), supporting HACA dominance. Temperature and pressure trends align with theoretical predictions.








Abstract
A pulsed flow high&#8208;temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C6H5) with acetylene (C2H2) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C2H2 Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C2H2+), 30 (NO+), 52 (C4H4+), 77 (C6H5+), 78 (C6H6+), 102 (C6H5C2H+), 103 (C6H5C2H2+), 107 (C6H5NO+), 128 (C10H8+), and 154 (C12H10+) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;A pulsed flow high-temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Re-TOF-MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) with acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 30 (NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 52 (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 77 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 78 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 102 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 103 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 107 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 128 (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and 154 (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Investigation of Surface&#8208;Responsive Riboflavin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled crystal of riboflavin exhibits responsive modes of surface&#8208;directed molecular assembly, accompanied by measurable electromechanical properties. This behavior highlights how subtle variations in molecular packing and supramolecular interactions at the crystal interface can directly influence macroscopic functional responses. By bridging the molecular organization with emergent physical properties, these findings elucidate key structure&#8211;function relationships, offering new perspectives for the design of bioinspired materials with tunable electromechanical properties.








Abstract
Metabolites, including amino acids, nucleobases, and vitamins, have emerged as promising candidates for sustainable functional materials due to their inherent biocompatibility and low fabrication costs. Notable examples include glycine&#8208;based nanogenerators, indigo&#8208;based organic transistors, and caffeine&#8208;based optical waveguides. Riboflavin (vitamin B2), forms optically active supramolecular structures in the tapetum lucidum of lemurs and cats; however, its detailed packing and functional role remain unknown. Here, aiming to explore the bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembly of riboflavin to uncover potential device applications, we discovered and extensively characterized a new single co&#8208;crystal using a combination of crystallography, microscopy, and mechanical experiments supported by atomistic molecular models to understand the organization on different surfaces. The crystals exhibit pronounced surface responsiveness, leading to the formation of distinct branched, twisted, and serrated micron&#8208;scale morphologies as the riboflavin self&#8208;assembled on different substrates of copper, mica, and silicon. This intrinsic ability to adapt shape and generate substrate&#8208;templated structures was confirmed computationally and experimentally and was attributed mainly to the crystal's relatively low Young's modulus, reflecting its lattice flexibility. This structure&#8211;function study of an adaptable metabolite crystal offers fundamental insights into how molecular organization governs mechanical responsiveness, advancing the understanding of bio&#8208;inspired crystallization and paving the way for future technological applications.

         <title>Toward Organic Mimics of Metallic Nanoparticles: Tuning and Enhancing Fluorescence in Binary Dye&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&#1074;FONs) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8208;but devoid of core&#8208;shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor&#8208;to&#8208;acceptor ratio.








Abstract
A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs) (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye&#8208;based core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 108 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1 per nanoparticle). However, &#1074;FONs' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET&#8208;mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core&#8208;shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &#1074;FONs composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &#1074;FONs retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Acceptor&#8208;less Dehydrogenation of a Germane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride abstraction from half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes leads to the generation of stable, but highly reactive, dinitrogen and triflate complexes that can activate Ge&#9472;H bonds. Reaction of the activated ruthenium complexes with GeH2Ph2leads to elimination of dihydrogen and formation of triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complexes.








Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;mediated activation of element&#8211;hydrogen bonds is an important goal for the preparation of commodity chemical compounds and novel materials. Here a facile route to the activation of germanium&#8208;hydrogen bonds, based on the spontaneous elimination of dihydrogen, is reported. This represents a mechanistic divergence from the established methods for Ge&#9472;H bond cleavage. The novel complexes [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] and [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 are central to the success of this route. These crystalline species may be prepared in high yield and are highly effective sources of the 16&#8208;electron [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(P)2]+ fragment. Both complexes react with GeH2Ph2 to eliminate H2 and afford [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(GePh2OTf)(P)2] [(P)2&#160;=&#160;2 PPh3, dppe], which is best described as a triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complex. Different species are observed on initial treatment of [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] or [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 with GeH2Ph2. In the dppe case, a &#963;&#8208;germane complex is identified, which is proposed to undergo spontaneous elimination of H2: a key step in the double Ge&#9472;H bond activation, promoted by the sterically demanding half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes. This represents a distinct pathway for Ge&#9472;H bond activation when compared to the established routes, such as deprotonation by a basic hydrocarbyl ligand or oxidative addition, leading the way to new pathways to functionalize organogermanium compounds.

This represents a distinct pathway for Ge&#9472;H bond activation when compared to the established routes, such as deprotonation by a basic hydrocarbyl ligand or oxidative addition, leading the way to new pathways to functionalize organogermanium compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ag5Pd2O4, a New Subvalent Silver Oxide, Obtained from Ag2PdO2 via a High&#8208;pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag5Pd2O4 has been obtained from the reaction of Ag2PdO2 at a hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The new oxide exhibits very short Ag&#8208;Ag distances and is subvalent with respect to silver. Quantum chemical calculations describe the new compound as metallic conducting.








Abstract
Subvalent silver oxides, where silver exhibits an oxidation state between 0 and&#160;+&#160;1, have traditionally been discovered serendipitously due to a lack of systematic synthesis methods and understanding of their bonding schemes. This study presents a novel, purposeful approach to synthesizing multinary subvalent silver oxides through high&#8208;pressure techniques. By subjecting the monovalent silver oxide Ag2PdO2 to hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K, subvalent Ag5Pd2O4 forms besides PdO. The crystal structure of Ag5Pd2O4, determined via in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals distinct layers of cationic silver aggregates and anionic oxopalladate units. Electronic structure calculations confirm the subvalent nature of silver in Ag5Pd2O4, showing a vanished band gap and increased electron density on silver atoms. The findings pave the way for developing materials with rich magneto&#8208;electronic functionalities, owing to the interplay between subvalent silver and transition metal cations.

         <title>Deep Learning for Hyperpolarized NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins without Resolution Loss: Access to Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>

Abstract
The inherently low sensitivity of solution&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has long limited its ability to characterize transient biomolecular states at atomic resolution. While dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) offers a compensating signal enhancement, its broader use has been hindered by rapid polarization decay, causing severe spectral distortion. Here, we introduce HyperW&#8208;Decon, an approach that enables high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution NMR of biomolecules in solution. HyperW&#8208;Decon combines two key aspects: (i) the use of hyperpolarized water (HyperW) to transfer polarization to proteins through rapid proton exchange; and (ii) a theory&#8208;driven, machine learning (ML)&#8211;based deconvolution method that corrects polarization&#8208;induced artifacts without requiring external reference signals. This approach is based on a first&#8208;principles understanding of dDNP line shapes and delivers a scalable solution to spectral distortion. Applied to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) involved in biomineralization, HyperW&#8208;Decon reveals previously inaccessible, short&#8208;lived ion&#8208;peptide encounter complexes with residue resolution.

         <title>Ultrafine Pd Nanoparticles on Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Dual Photo/Thermal Catalysis of Scalable C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 59, October 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a phosphine&#8208;functionalized COF&#8208;supported ultrafine Pd nanoparticle catalyst (TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs). It enables efficient thermal and photocatalytic C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings, including with less reactive aryl chlorides, demonstrating high activity, broad applicability, excellent stability, and recyclability for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
The development of highly active and reusable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable organic synthesis remains a critical challenge. Here, a covalent organic framework (TyPPc&#8208;COF) with aldehyde residues was synthesized and post&#8208;modified with triphenylphosphine ligands to construct TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF. Subsequently, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (2.73&#160;nm) were uniformly anchored onto TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF via phosphine&#8208;Pd coordination. The resultant TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs exhibit dual&#8208;mode catalytic functionality: In C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl iodides, this catalyst demonstrates excellent performance under both thermal catalytic conditions (50&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1060 h&#8722;1) and photocatalytic conditions (30&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1780 h&#8722;1), achieving gram&#8208;scale yields (&gt;80%). Notably, under both photocatalytic and thermal catalytic conditions, this catalyst also efficiently catalyzes Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira C&#8208;C coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and aryl chlorides, which typically exhibit lower activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that light irradiation can effectively extend catalytic functionality to C&#8208;N bond formation. Stability tests revealed negligible Pd leaching/aggregation after multiple cycles, confirming structural robustness. This work provides a general strategy for designing COF@MNPs merging high activity, recyclability, and environmental compatibility, advancing sustainable organic synthesis.

The development of broadly useful C&#8208;P cross&#8208;couplings of (hetero)aryl chlorides and HP(O)(R/OR)2 nucleophiles by use of nickel/DalPhos&#8208;based catalysts is described, along with findings from DFT studies that confirm the preference for C&#8208;P bond formation in this system arising from three&#8208;cantered reductive elimination through substrate PV pathways.








Abstract
Herein we disclose our development of broadly useful C&#8208;P cross&#8208;couplings of (hetero)aryl chlorides and HP(O)(R)2 or HP(O)(OR)2 nucleophiles, enabled by use of nickel/DalPhos&#8208;based catalysts. These typically use 5 mol% nickel at 110 &#176;C for 18&#160;hours, but the feasibility of shorter or milder reactions was demonstrated with one specific example. The ability to apply such transformations on gram scale, and in the P&#8208;arylation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) (i.e., chloroquine and clozapine) was also shown. Also described are our findings arising from the computational modelling of such cross&#8208;coupling reactions by use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which confirmed the clear preference for C&#8208;P bond formation involving three&#8208;centered reductive elimination through substrate PV pathways.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Lipid&#8208;Modified Derivatives of Tunicamycins</title>

Tunicamycins inhibit the bacterial enzyme MraY, which is involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, but they also inhibit human GPT, leading to cytotoxicity. This study investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. As a result, an analogue was identified that exhibited antibacterial activity without cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Naturally occurring antibiotic tunicamycin targets bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis by inhibiting bacterial phospho&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuraminic acid (MurNAc)&#8208;pentapeptide translocase (MraY), but it also inhibits human UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc): polyprenol phosphate translocase (GPT), leading to cytotoxicity. This study thoroughly investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl side chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. Longer alkyl chains and flexible structures were found to favor MraY inhibitory activity, and benzene rings were acceptable for binding. The hybrid analogue containing oleoyl group, which contributed most significantly to MraY inhibitory activity, and the MurNAc moiety, which is important for MraY&#8208;selective inhibition, showed enhanced MraY inhibitory activity as well as improved antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. faecium.

An angelic figure holds a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC) formed from {Fe(NO)2}10 and {Fe(NO)2}&#8313; mononuclear precursors. With its rare &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3 bridge and stabilization by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, the complex symbolizes the delicate balance of redox and structural forces in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Reaction of a {Fe(NO)3}10 trinitrosyl iron complex with a mononuclear {Fe(NO)2}10 dinitrosyl iron complex furnishes a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex, [(NO)2(IMes)Fe(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3)Fe(IMes)(NO)2] (3) (IMes&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals an unprecedented &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3&#8722; bridge that links two [Fe(NO)2] motifs, giving an Fe&#8230;.Fe separation of 3.45&#160;&#197;. Nonclassical C&#9472;H&#8230;F contacts (3.21 &#8211; 3.61&#160;&#197;) between the mesityl methyl groups of the IMes and the nonbridging fluorine atom cradle the anion and create a pseudo&#8208;tridentate environment that stabilizes the mixed&#8208;valent core. Infrared spectroscopy exhibits four &#957;(NO) bands at 1778, 1736, 1715, and 1682 cm&#8722;1, inferring the presence of two electronically different {Fe(NO)2} units, whereas 77&#160;K EPR spectroscopy gives a rhombic signal with gavg&#160;=&#160;2.109, diagnostic of an s&#160;=&#160;1/2 species in complex 3.

         <title>Enantioselective Route to Terminal 2,3&#8208;Epoxy Tosylates Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of 2&#8208;Substituted Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization strategy from bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols to challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed using commercial L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol/(R,R)&#8208;TADDOL system or the enantiomeric catalytic couple. (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208; epoxides are obtained in moderate to good yield and up to 76% ee. Useful elaborations to functionalized products and remarkably to privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocycles, were demonstrated.








Abstract
A first enantioselective synthesis of challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed via an organocatalytic desymmetrization reaction of bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols. The intramolecular nucleophilic substitution has been cooperatively catalyzed by commercially available mixtures of L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol and (R,R)&#8208;&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8217;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2 disubstituted 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL) or the enantiomeric couple, leading to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides in up to 87% yield and 76% ee. Reaction monitoring highlighted the double role of leaving group and nucleophile played by the p&#8208;toluensulfonate anion, which was found to be responsible of epoxide ring&#8208;opening back to the reagent. The latter process affects the conversion to the epoxide, but marginally the enantioselectivity. These uncommon epoxides, bearing a quaternary stereocenter, demonstrated to be versatile intermediates to prepare functionalized products and remarkably, privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208; membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Ligand Field Effects in Electron&#8208;Rich Heterometallic Extended Metal Atom Chain Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multimetallic compounds with modifiable scaffolding ligands raises questions about the distribution of electronic effects in heterometallic systems. Here we investigate the asymmetry of the substituent effects in a modified 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyradylamine ligand applied to a heterotrimetallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) framework. We find that the Mo2 core experiences a stronger effect than the heterometal, counter to expectations based on metal atom electronegativity.








Abstract
In heterometallic systems, electron donation from the ligands may influence the metal atoms in either a symmetric or asymmetric way, with the expected case being that the more electronegative metal is favored. Here, we describe a systematic study of heterometallic compounds where this expectation is not observed. In this study, we use a modification of the symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine (dpa) ligand with electron donating ethyl groups, the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine ligand (dedpa), to prepare heterometallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) complexes with formula Mo2M&#8242;(dedpa)4Cl2 (M&#8242; = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The effects of the electron donating substituents were studied through techniques including crystallography, magnetometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. We find that the new HEMACs are indeed more electron rich, easier to oxidize, and, most interestingly, the impact of the ethyl substituents is not applied equally to all the metals in the chain. The ligand field is stronger at the Mo2 site, but is surprisingly weaker at the M&#8242; center when compared to Mo2M&#8242;(dpa)4Cl2 complexes. We also find that changing the ligand field allows for previously unassigned electronic transitions to become visible, including excitations tentatively assigned to a triplet &#948;&#8208;&#948;* state within the Mo2 unit.

An ionic liquid consisting of 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ions undergoes a room&#8208;temperature transformation from a paramagnetic liquid to a diamagnetic solid.

Abstract
An ionic liquid consisting of a 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radical anion and a tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ion, 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722;, undergoes a transformation near room temperature from paramagnetic liquid to diamagnetic solid accompanied by significant changes in photophysical properties. A blue solid of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; melts upon heating above 328&#160;K, yielding a green liquid. The green liquid exhibits a magnetic susceptibility of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 emu mol&#8722;1. Upon cooling, the liquid retains its paramagnetic properties until the temperature reaches approximately 300&#160;K. Upon further cooling below 300&#160;K, the paramagnetic liquid reverts to the initial blue solid. The solid form of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; exhibits near&#8208;zero magnetic susceptibility. The thermal hysteresis loop with magnetic bistability is observed without decomposition over the temperature range from 300 to 328&#160;K. Crystal structure analysis, electron spin resonance (ESR), and electronic spectra indicate that the drastic changes in magnetic properties are attributable to the reversible &#960;&#8208;dimerization of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; species during the solid&#8211;liquid/liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions. Additionally, the association/dissociation behaviors of the TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; dimers also induce significant changes in photophysical properties, especially in the short&#8208;wave infrared region (1000&#8211;2500&#160;nm), suggesting the potential application of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; as a bifunctional material.

         <title>Substitution of CH3 by CH2F in 2&#8208;Methylerythritol Cyclodiphosphate Triggers Potent Inhibition of IspG with Concomitant Fluoride Ion Expulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoromethyl analogue of MEcPP was identified as a very potent inhibitor of the oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme IspG. In the course of the IspG&#8208;catalyzed transformation, this novel compound undergoes fluoride elimination, offering additional evidence for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the mechanism of this enzyme.








Abstract
IspG (also known as GcpE) is a key [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a well&#8208;established target for the development of new antimicrobials. This oxygen&#8208;sensitive enzyme mediates the reductive dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol 2,4&#8208;cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate (HMBPP), requiring electron transfer proteins to deliver two electrons needed for catalysis. To probe the mechanism of IspG and access new mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, we synthesized a substrate analogue, monofluoromethyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol cyclodiphosphate, in which the natural methyl group of MEcPP is replaced by a CH2F group. This analogue proved to be a potent inhibitor of IspG. This study also demonstrates that electron capture is a prerequisite for inhibition and that the inhibitor leads to fluoride release in the IspG&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Together, these results provide further support for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the IspG mechanism.

         <title>Helical Polymer&#8208;Based Polycarboxylate as Chiral Ligands in Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains forms a polycarboxylate that provides an asymmetric and hydrophobic environment in basic water. The polycarboxylate serves as an efficient ligand for copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in water, affording chiral products with up to 99% ee. Control experiments suggest the formation of dicarboxylate&#8211;copper complexes via inter&#8208;unit carboxylate coordination.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQXlac) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains derived from l&#8208;lactic acid were used for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in water. The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of PQXlac (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO3)2 (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of PQXlac and PQXteg, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.

         <title>A Simple Design of UV&#8208;curable Covalent Adaptive Networks Operated by Thiourea Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple covalent adaptable network with a thiourea bond exchange mechanism is demonstrated. A feature is the use of thiol&#8208;ene UV&#8208;curing, realized through the synthesis of a diallyl monomer bearing thiourea units. The curing behavior, rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability are evaluated, providing insights for straightforward yet versatile CAN design strategies.








Abstract
Using the concept of covalent adaptive networks (CANs), or vitrimers, sustainable and reprocessable cross&#8208;linked polymer materials can be developed. Advances in molecular design and understanding of the underlying physics are essential for translating such bond exchange concepts into practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the design of a simple CAN system via UV&#8208;curing of a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, where the network is formed by reacting telechelic allyl monomers with tri&#8208;functional thiol cross&#8208;linkers. The telechelic allyl monomer, containing thiourea bonds, is synthesized specifically for this purpose, with thiourea units acting as dynamic bond exchange sites within the network. Notably, this design offers broad tunability in the topological and chemical features, highlighting an important principle in the development of model CANs for physical property investigation. Here, we evaluate curing behavior, temperature&#8208;sweep rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability for a representative formulation, providing insights into simple yet versatile design strategies.

Starting with small planar benzotellurazoles, it is possible to create 3D supramolecular architectures. These exhibit a high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which is caused by various chalcogen bonding (ChB) motifs. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents onto the benzotellurazole makes the ChB motifs more apparent and results in more complex superstructures.








Abstract
In addition to hydrogen and halogen bonds, chalcogen bonds (ChBs) are gaining significance in the domain of crystal engineering. Nitrogen&#8208;containing tellurium compounds are well&#8208;suited for this purpose, as they form a variety of solid&#8208;state structures through ChBs. Despite prior studies addressing substituent effects in benzotellurazoles, the influence of fluorine atoms on the benzene backbone of 1,3&#8208;benzotellurazoles remains to be investigated in the context of solid&#8208;state arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorine atoms can impact the nature and quantity of ChBs in the solid state. The electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the introduced substituents result in alterations to the ChB donor (Te) and acceptor (N) properties, leading to a preferential interaction with competing Lewis bases such as carbonyl groups. A noteworthy exception was noticed for the derivatives with a nitrile group at position 2. Regardless of the number of fluorine atoms, a high degree of 3D cross&#8208;linking can be observed via a 5&#8208;ChBs&#8208;5&#8208;neighbors motif, including a characteristic two&#8208;lone&#8208;pair/one&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hole interaction. These findings offer valuable design principles for supramolecular materials, particularly in the context of crystal engineering.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Organic Phototheranostics: Matching Rotatable Donors and Shielding Acceptors for Enhanced Imaging and Phototherapy by Stabilized Triplet Excitons and Optimized Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed by molecular engineering of acceptor shielding and donor rotation. Notably, BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) showed high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 63%, achieving superior efficacy in NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) have received significant interests in cancer treatment by enabling precise positioning of deep&#8208;seated lesions and highly efficient ablation of tumors. However, competition between radiative and nonradiative pathways of the excitons sets great obstacles for obtaining robust OPTAs. Herein, we propose to fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;&#8208;bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2&#8208;vinylthiophene as &#960;&#8208;bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN&#8208;P NPs achieved both high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II angiography and imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.

         <dc:description>
A green synthetic approach to planar hexacyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides was successfully accomplished via the [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization between ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions, yielding products in good to excellent quantities.

Abstract
A cascade cyclization of polycyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides has been realized via metal&#8208;free [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions in good to excellent yield. In this process, three rings and four bonds are formed with high atom economy under reaction conditions that comply with green chemistry principles. The biological activity of the indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs, which mimic the structure of lamellarins&#8212;a group of marine natural products&#8212;was evaluated. The results indicated that these indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs exhibited notable anti&#8208;cancer activity, with cytotoxicity profiles comparable to those of their lamellarin counterparts.

         <title>Dual Excited&#8208;State Charge&#8208;Transfer Process in Luminescent Radicals with Spatially Folded Arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report four donor&#8211;acceptor structured luminescent radicals in which spatial folding between carbazole and radical units induces a unique dual excited&#8208;state CT process involving both TBCT and TSCT. Systematic photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations elucidate how these two CT pathways influence the emissive behaviors of the radicals.








Abstract
The through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) mechanism has attracted significant attention in closed&#8208;shell organic luminescent materials due to its strong environmental sensitivity, small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and high exciton utilization efficiency. However, open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals mostly adopt D&#8211;A or D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A skeletons to overcome the dark&#8208;state limitations of radicals, relying solely on a through&#8208;bond charge transfer (TBCT) process. To date, TSCT excited states in radical systems remain largely unexplored. In this study, we report the coexistence of TSCT and TBCT mechanisms in radical molecules. Four luminescent radicals (TB&#8208;MR, TB&#8208;DR, TBS&#8208;MR, and TBS&#8208;DR) were systematically investigated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. The results reveal that the spatially folded conformation between carbazole units and radical centers in the TBS series induces abnormal photophysical behaviors deviating from conventional paradigms. Further electron&#8211;hole analysis indicates that the TBS series exhibits a dual excited&#8208;state charge transfer (CT) mechanism, with TSCT and TBCT contributions of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. This discovery not only elucidates the influence of multiple CT processes on the excited&#8208;state behaviors of luminescent radicals but also establishes a novel excited&#8208;state engineering strategy for tuning the luminescence of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Toward Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethanes: Green Synthesis Routes and Recycling Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.








Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are extensively utilized polymers known for their excellent properties. However, the conventional synthesis of PUs heavily depends on toxic isocyanates, creating significant environmental and health risks. To mitigate these issues, research has increasingly focused on synthesizing non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs). This review systematically discusses the primary green synthesis routes for NIPUs: (1) Bis(dialkyl carbonate) route, (2) Transurethanization route, (3) Cyclic carbonate route, and (4) Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) route. While PUs exhibit superior mechanical and chemical performance, their disposal at the end of life remains a major challenge. Currently, the main recovery methods include chemical degradation (or raw material recycling) and mechanical recycling, with chemical recycling offering potential for a closed&#8208;loop process. This review briefly summarizes these disposal strategies, aiming to encourage sustainable practices. It highlights recent advancements in green synthesis and recycling technologies, focusing on pathways for creating environmentally friendly and recyclable NIPUs. In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8211;Imidazolium Salt&#8208;Based Bioinspired Nanoreactor: Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Unprotected Isatin with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst system was demonstrated to promote the arylation of unprotected isatins with arylboronic acids in aqueous ethanol with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity was largely independent of the H2O/ethanol solvent composition ratio, indicating a reaction mechanism involving intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion of the NHC&#8211;Rh complex intermediate within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity tethered to the NHC ligand.








Abstract
The optically active 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton is a promising pharmacophore in drug design and has led to the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions using designed chiral ligands for synthesizing 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles from isatins (2,3&#8208;oxindoles), 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. Although the arylation of isatins is vital for convergent synthesis, most studies have used N&#8208;protected isatins, requiring the removal of protecting groups to obtain the desired bioactive products. Despite limited success in the direct high&#8208;enantioselective arylation of unprotected isatins (NH isatins), such arylation holds significant potential for improving atomic and synthetic efficiencies. In aqueous media, cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic and chiral cavities can selectively include organic compounds, making them potential nanoreactors for asymmetric reactions. In this study, imidazolium salts bearing a &#160;&#947;&#8208;CD were applied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of NH isatins in environmentally benign aqueous ethanol. The arylation was successfully achieved in high yield and enantioselectivity using our &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst. This suggests that the arylation proceeds in the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity (host) through the self&#8208;inclusion of NHC&#9472;Rh complex intermediates (guests). These bio&#8208;inspired transition metal catalysts based on host&#8211;guest linkage systems are expected to contribute significantly to the development of efficient organic synthesis reactions with high enantioselectivity.

Abstract
The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g&#8208;C16N19) with a super&#8208;large pore structure based on the self&#8208;doping strategy and first&#8208;principles calculations, and constructs TM@g&#8208;C16N19 (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti &#8764; Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four&#8208;Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g&#8208;C16N19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (UL) of &#8208;0.23&#160;V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro&#8208;mechanism of W@g&#8208;C16N19 effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N2 molecules through strong d&#8208;p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH&#8208;potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E&#8208;I/S&#8208;V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E&#8208;I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;V/S&#8208;O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.

         <title>Exploring 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides: Lifetime&#8208;Based Sensing of Chemical Micro&#8208;Environments</title>

We present a library of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and evaluate their fluorescence lifetime responses to polarity and viscosity. Using fluorescence lifetime, we report polarity changes in rat serum during acute pancreatitis. These probes offer new tools for microenvironment sensing.








Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime offers a powerful approach to probe chemical microenvironments in biological systems, yet suitable fluorophores remain limited. Here, we report the synthesis and photophysical characterisation of a library of fifteen 4&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides, incorporating diverse aliphatic and aromatic amines. These compounds exhibit strong solvatochromism and varied fluorescence lifetimes in response to polarity and viscosity. Notably, compound&#160;13&#160;demonstrates high brightness and pronounced fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to polarity, while compound&#160;17&#160;shows strong viscosity&#8208;dependent lifetime changes. We apply compound&#160;13&#160;to rat serum samples, revealing significant differences in fluorescence lifetime between healthy and acute pancreatitis conditions, consistent with polarity changes. In contrast, compound&#160;17&#160;showed no lifetime variation, suggesting limited viscosity changes in serum. These findings highlight the potential of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as environment&#8208;sensitive probes, particularly for polarity sensing in complex biological samples. More generally, this work expands the photophysical understanding of naphthalimide derivatives and supports their application in fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing of disease&#8208;related microenvironmental changes.

         <title>Enantiospecific Syntheses of Bicyclic Fragrance Molecules From Verbenone: Enhancing Odour Profiles and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;step synthetic route has been developed for the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic, nor&#8208;polywood derivatives using a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step. These newly synthesized trans&#8208;decalin derivatives exhibited the characteristic woody odor of this class of compounds. The corresponding [6,7] and [6,5] derivatives have also been synthesized to compare their properties with the trans&#8208;decalin derivatives. All the products were obtained with a high degree of chirality starting from (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone as the chiral pool starting material.








Abstract
Fragrances derived from terpenoid scaffolds continue to play a central role in the design of synthetic odorants, with trans&#8208;fused decalin system providing particularly valuable ambergris like woody notes. Inspired by the structural and stereochemical features of polywood and its analogues, we report herein a concise and versatile synthetic approach to novel bicyclic frameworks from the chiral pool precursor (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone. An efficient, enantiospecific synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic fragrance molecules, including nor&#8208;polywood and novel [6,7]&#8208; and [6,5]&#8208;fused analogues, is reported. This six&#8208;step synthetic sequence utilized a powerful combination of conjugate addition, cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening, and a key Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis (RCM) reactions. Subsequent stereoselective reductions, acetylations, and hydrogenations yield a diverse range of bicyclic frameworks in good overall yields with excellent stereocontrol. Importantly, olfactory evaluation confirms that all synthesized products retain the characteristic woody, amber&#8208;like notes of premium ambergris substitutes. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of ring&#8208;size variation on fragrance properties, providing new insights for the rational design of sophisticated odorants. This work not only provides an efficient synthesis of structurally diverse bicyclic systems but also expands the chemical space of ambergris&#8208;type odorants, offering new insights into structure&#8211;odour relationships for the development of next&#8208;generation woody fragrance ingredients.

         <title>Unlocking Diversity of Biologically Relevant Quinoline Scaffolds by Leveraging the Readily Available Feedstocks Under Cobalt&#8208;NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases a rare cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot green protocol that enables divergent open&#8208;air synthesis and functionalization of two quinoline frameworks starting from the simple, nonhalogenated, biomass&#8208;derived precursors to deliver six different quinoline derivatives, promising candidates for medicinal and material science applications.








Abstract
Quinolines are privileged heterocycles with widespread applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. However, sustainable and efficient one&#8208;pot methods for synthesizing and functionalizing quinolines, e.g., 2&#8208;methyl/aminoquinoline derivatives remained scarce. Herein, we report a unified, green, and operationally simple one&#8208;pot strategy, which is enabled by a multitasking Co&#8208;NHC catalyst (Co3). Starting from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol and acetone or benzyl nitrile as reactant, the present method achieves selective cyclization under open&#8208;air conditions to afford 2&#8208;methyl or 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, respectively. Remarkably, the same catalytic system enables divergent C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization's, including alkenylation, alkylation, dimerization, and N&#8208;alkylation in a single pot, yielding six structurally distinct quinoline classes. The protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent chemoselectivity, and high step economy, generating water and/or H2 as byproducts. Detailed mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments, intermediate isolation, NMR/HRMS analysis, and DFT studies, reveal the dual catalytic role of the Co&#8208;NHC complex in both cyclization and subsequent transformations. Overall, the current cobalt&#8208;catalyzed platform paves the way for sustainable access to diverse quinoline architectures under mild and green conditions, relevant to drug discovery and advanced functional materials.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Long&#8208;Wavelength Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters: Mechanistic Insights and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the narrowband emission with high efficiency, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials are crucial for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in these emitters and also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material represents a groundbreaking advancement in organic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with the enhanced efficiency and spectral accuracy. Leveraging the MR effect, MR&#8208;TADF materials inherently achieve narrow emission profiles that are crucial for High&#8208;definition display. These materials offer a significant advantage over traditional phosphorescence and TADF emitters, which enable high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with intrinsically narrow emission spectra. However, realizing full&#8208;color ultra&#8208;narrowband emission is hindered by the intrinsic conflict between spectral tunability and narrowing of the emission bandwidth. Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of the spectral narrowing mechanisms and the integration of precise molecular design strategies that balance efficiency, tunability, and emission purity. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped MR emitters, including the fundamental mechanisms, quantitative metrics, and recent breakthroughs. It also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum, offering strategic guidance for the future development of OLED materials with enhanced color purity and performance.

         <title>Coping with the Blues: Simple and Photo&#8208;Stable Dye for Long&#8208;Term Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

PyPe is a fluorescent emitter with low photobleaching thanks to its vinyl moiety serving as a radiationless relaxation group. This favors the configuration flip between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers at excited states and promotes photostability. Then, photodimers form in various kinetics and proportions depending on temperature and complexation. Low toxicity makes it a blue photostable dye, readily taken up by cells, and suitable for bioimaging experiments.








Abstract
Dyes for long&#8208;term imaging of live cells are rare, especially in the blue region, as they need to be nontoxic and photo&#8208;stable. New simple pyrene&#8208;derived dyes have been synthesized and fully characterized, showing good cellular uptake, intense emission, and excellent stability. Their unusual stability secret lies in their flexible conformation, evidenced by the solid&#8208;state structures of coordination compounds obtained from the dyes and by 1H&#8208;NMR solution studies. Results show that under irradiation, the pyrene&#8208;based dye undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) that leads to a configurational switching occurring at time scales that are faster than the formation of possible photobleaching products. Irradiation of these dyes over 24&#160;hours shows great photostability that was evaluated in different solvents. The possible mechanism of the stability of these dyes is discussed here. Being nontoxic and emitting at only a specific wavelength, these compounds are perfect for staining the cytosol of live cells and long&#8208;term imaging in parallel with other dyes of different colors.

         <title>Synthesis of Dithienylcycloalkene Molecular Switches Enabled by a Bench&#8208;Stable Ti&#8208;Complex</title>

Herein we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged DTEs with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of these analogs was performed via a key McMurry coupling step, which was enabled by a practical, bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex. Remarkably, it is shown that the strained cyclobutene bridge outperforms other rings, even the most commonly featured cyclopentene, in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Herein, we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged dithienylethene (DTE) molecular switches with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. These analogs were accessed via McMurry carbonyl coupling using a bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex reagent instead of the generally applied fuming, liquid TiCl4, making the synthesis more practical and reproducible. The efficiency of the reaction was dependent on the ring size, providing the lowest yield for the largest, 7&#8208;membered ring. Structures having 3&#8208;membered cyclopropene bridges were prepared using an alternative strategy. Remarkably, the comparison of the photoswitching properties of the series showed that molecules bearing a strained cyclobutene bridge outperform the other switches in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Ligand (&#945;&#8208;Diamine vs. &#945;&#8208;Diimine) Makes Big Differences in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene (Co)Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors has been synthesized and characterized. In comparision to classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogues, the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes big differences in complex configuration and catalytic properties toward ethylene (co)polymerization.








Abstract
The nitrogen donor atom is widely used in the design and synthesis of olefin polymerization catalysts, while the amine donor featured sp3 hybridized N is less applied in the ligand design than the imine donor featured sp2 hybridized N. We have herein reported the synthesis and characterization of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors and their catalytic properties toward homopolymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate (MA). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses identify that the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes have a significantly distorted chelate ring (N&#9472;C&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Pd), which is distinct from conventional &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium complexes with a planar chelate ring. Ethylene polymerization results elucidate that bulky steric hindrance of the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst is required to achieve high activity and high molecular weight polymer. Comparisons of ethylene (co)polymerization results between the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst and the classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogue disclose that the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes a decreasing change in catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight but an increase in the degree of linearity of polymeric product and MA incorporation in EMA copolymer.

         <title>Pharmaceuticals Made with Hydrogen: A Sustainable and Efficient Approach Using Flow Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a sustainable strategy for pharmaceutical manufacturing by combining hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysis, and continuous flow synthesis. The development of novel catalysts and their application in a multi&#8208;step synthesis of donepezil enabled a highly productive process with no intermediate purification. This work establishes a new, greener pathway for a hydrogen&#8208;powered, carbon&#8208;neutral future.








Abstract
Conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on fossil fuels and inefficient batch processes, creating significant waste. This review presents a strategy using hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysts, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis for a more sustainable and efficient approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing. We detail two key innovations: first, highly efficient catalysts (Pt/C and polysilane&#8208;modified Pd) for atom&#8208;economical C&#9472;N bond formation. Our flow systems offered superior performance and broad functional group tolerance. Second, we developed a robust polysilane&#8208;immobilized Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic catalyst for selective arene hydrogenation under mild conditions. We successfully integrated these technologies into a seamless, multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil. By successfully integrating these technologies and overcoming challenges like catalyst inhibition, this work demonstrates a highly productive and sustainable process. This approach represents a significant step toward a greener, hydrogen&#8208;powered future for chemical manufacturing.

In this study, chiral spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] are synthesized by integrating two biologically active heterocyclic scaffolds, furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines and oxindoles, in a single molecule in the presence of quinine&#8208;derived squaramide through Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement.

Abstract
An unprecedented organocatalytic enantioselective methodology has been unlocked to access oxindole&#8208;fused spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with high bond efficiency (two new C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;O bond) and two contiguous stereocenters via Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. A series of spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] has been synthesized in excellent yield (up to 90%) and stereoselectivity (dr up to 99:1, er up to 97:3) from 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles and 5&#8208;alkylidene barbituric acids at room temperature. 1H NMR and HRMS studies have been conducted to define the reaction pathway.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Analysis of Phenolic Phytoprostanes, Oxidized Derivatives of Lipophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four hydroxytyrosol&#8208;phytoprostanes (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) was achieved in 20 steps, enabling their first identification as HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate oxidation products. This work revealed new oxidized derivatives of lipophenols via UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, offering a strategy to trace HT&#8208;derived compounds in complex matrices, aiding food and biomedical research.








Abstract
Lipophenols, or phenolipids, are compounds that combine polyphenols with fatty acids, offering the antioxidant properties of polyphenols alongside the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits of omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Hydroxytyrosol (HT)&#8208;based lipophenols have recently been identified in olive oil. Depending on their structure, these compounds were differently affected by storage conditions. While the concentrations of HT&#8208;oleate and HT&#8208;linoleate increase with higher storage temperatures, HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate (HT&#8208;ALA) did not follow the same trend. Given the high oxidative susceptibility of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid (ALA), which leads to oxidation products known as phytoprostanes (PhytoPs), we hypothesize that HT&#8208;ALA may be oxidized into covalently bound PhytoP conjugates of HT (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) under various oxidative conditions, including, for example, suboptimal storage. This study aims to develop the first total synthesis of two series of PhytoPs&#8208;HT as analytical standards to explore the oxidative transformation of HT&#8208;ALA lipophenols into potential oxylipin metabolites. The synthesis of four ALA&#8208;derived PhytoPs&#8208;HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT&#8208;ALA by UHPLC&#8208;HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT&#8208;PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.

         <title>Methyl on the Bridge: 2&#8208;Methyl Propellane as Precursor for 1,3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Methylated Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes</title>

The synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane and its conversion to various 1,2&#8208; and 1,2,3&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted bicyclopentanes is reported.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as isosteric replacements for mono&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted benzene rings in medicinal and materials applications, involving substitution at the BCP bridgehead (1,3&#8208;positions). BCP functionalization at the 2&#8208;position is much less straightforward and currently under intense investigation. Herein, we report a synthetic route to 2&#8208;methyl BCPs allowing for functionalization at the 1,3&#8208;positions, with the novel 2&#8208;methyl[1.1.1]propellane as a key intermediate. Next to an optimization for the synthesis of 2&#8208;Me&#8208;propellane, this work contains an investigation of its reactivity leading to 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCP derivatives. Compared to nonsubstituted propellane, the synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane was lower&#8208;yielding, and its ring&#8208;opening reactions proceeded in similar or lower yields, with radical&#8208;based reactions generally giving the best results. A preliminary study of selected physicochemical properties was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of a bridge&#8208;methyl group, showing an expected increase of about 0.5 logP units and featuring lower melting points.

&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as isosteric replacements for mono- and para-substituted benzene rings in medicinal and materials applications, involving substitution at the BCP bridgehead (1,3-positions). BCP functionalization at the 2-position is much less straightforward and currently under intense investigation. Herein, we report a synthetic route to 2-methyl BCPs allowing for functionalization at the 1,3-positions, with the novel 2-methyl[1.1.1]propellane as a key intermediate. Next to an optimization for the synthesis of 2-Me-propellane, this work contains an investigation of its reactivity leading to 1,2-disubstituted and 1,2,3-trisubstituted BCP derivatives. Compared to nonsubstituted propellane, the synthesis of 2-methyl propellane was lower-yielding, and its ring-opening reactions proceeded in similar or lower yields, with radical-based reactions generally giving the best results. A preliminary study of selected physicochemical properties was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of a bridge-methyl group, showing an expected increase of about 0.5 log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; units and featuring lower melting points.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Narrowband Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs using two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes as emitters are fabricated, which exhibit narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 and 26&#160;nm, respectively, resulting in small CIEy values &lt; 0.15. The OELDs also show low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 8.3% and 8.0% at 1000&#160;cd/m2, respectively.








Abstract
This study designed and synthesized two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes featured with aryl&#8208; modified N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, PtTJ&#8208;Ph and PtTJ&#8208;bPh, which exhibited narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19.0 and 19.8&#160;nm in dichloromethane, respectively. They also showed remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields of 99% and 93%, along with short excited&#8208;state lifetimes of 2.72 &#181;s and 2.34 &#181;s in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, respectively. Deep&#8208;blue OLED device using PtTJ&#8208;Ph as emitter exhibited narrowband emission spectrum peaking at 458&#160;nm with a small FWHM value of 25&#160;nm, resulting in a small Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y coordinate of 0.138. The device also achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7%, and maintained an EQE of 20.8% at 1000&#160;cd/m2 with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of only 8.3%, demonstrating excellent electroluminescent properties for deep&#8208;blue OLED application.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Photoluminescence System via Co&#8208;Ligand Variation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a modular spin crossover&#8208;photoluminescence (SCO&#8208;PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co&#8208;ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO&#8208;PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.








Abstract
Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin&#8208;state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO&#8208;PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(L)4(RCN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;nRCN, bearing four BODIPY&#8208;derived fluorophores L (L&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable RCN co&#8208;ligands (CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3(CH2)2CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co&#8208;ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T1/2 =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for R&#160;=&#160;CH3CH2 and R&#160;=&#160;CH2CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T1/2.

     alt="T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY-Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin-Crossover-Photoluminescence System via Co-Ligand Variation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a modular spin crossover-photoluminescence (SCO-PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co-ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO-PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin-state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO-PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;n&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN, bearing four BODIPY-derived fluorophores &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;L&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-[(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-tetrazol-1-yl)methyl]-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN co-ligands (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCN, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co-ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Proton Conductivities of Stepwise Protonated Imidazole&#8208;Fused Tetraphenylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.








Abstract
The control of crystal structure and proton conductivity was evaluated by stepwise protonation of tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.

         <title>Substituent Effects on Sulfur Phenolate Exchange Reactions: Reactivity and Bonding Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital interactions, and to smaller effect: solvent effects, dominate over Pauli repulsions to determine the success of the SuPhenEx click reaction.








Abstract
The Sulfur Phenolate Exchange reaction (SuPhenEx) provides a fluorine&#8208;free alternative S(VI) exchange chemistry by substituting nitrophenolate as the leaving group instead of fluoride (as in SuFEx reactions), offering a synthetically appealing and environmentally friendly approach in click chemistry. Despite its significance, the reaction mechanism and the underlying electronic interactions in the course of the reaction have yet to be thoroughly explored at the molecular level. Here, we elucidate the electronic interactions of a series of SuPhenEx model reactions between various para&#8208;substituted phenolates (p&#8208;R&#8208;Ph&#8208;O&#8211;) as nucleophiles and PhSO2&#8208;OPh&#8211;p&#8208;NO2 as an electrophile, in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases. As tools, we apply the Activation Strain Model based on density functional theory. We identified the HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction as the key determinant of reactivity in the gas phase, which shifts to include (HOMO&#8208;1)&#8211;(LUMO&#160;+&#160;1) contributions in the solvent phase, and showed how these interactions can be tuned through the choice of the substituent in the para&#8208;substituted phenolate nucleophiles. The resulting insights, consistent across both phases, facilitate steering future experiments in these and related S(VI) substitution reactions.

         <title>Hybridization on DNA&#8208;Coated Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were functionalized with covalently attached DNA strands of 20 or 30 nucleotides. This was achieved via click chemistry with alkyne&#8208;terminated DNA and azide&#8208;terminated gold nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The DNA strands were fluorescently labelled with either FAM or Cy3, permitting their detection and quantification on the nanoparticle surface. Complementary DNA strands were attached to the nanoparticles via hybridization. The connection of gold nanoparticles by complementary DNA strands was also demonstrated. In&#8208;situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.

&lt;p&gt;DNA-conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.

         <title>Metal Chloride&#8208;Iodate Nonlinear Optical Materials via Direct Chlorination of Centrosymmetric Metal Iodate Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple method that structural directing agents anion could effectively regulate the orientation of polar basic building units to achieve centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric transformation is presented. The resultant three excellent NLO crystals of crystals RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl were discovered.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) crystals may show many interesting and important physical properties and wide applications in science and technology but they are rare in contrast to centrosymmetric crystals. The development of NCS crystals from known centrosymmetric (CS) crystals is of fundamental and applied importance. Herein, a simple and effective strategy that by addition of appropriate diluted HCl into CS crystals to react directly was proposed for the reversal of the CS to NCS structure by utilizing the structural directing agents Cl&#8722; anion to break the symmetry and then to regulate orientation and arrangement of anionic moieties. The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO3)3Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&#8722; anion&#8208; induced transformation from parent CS A2M(IO3)4(H0.5IO3)2 and Cs2Fe(HIO3)(IO3)5. Remarkably, Al&#8208; and Ga&#8208;based compounds RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.

         <title>Mechanisms of Chiral Induction to Foldamer Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical foldamers are often built from achiral components and thus have no inherent bias to their twist sense. This review describes mechanisms for controlling their handedness using appended stereocenters. It examines how point chirality directs the twist sense through a combination of short&#8208;range interactions to the directly attached repeat unit and long&#8208;range interactions with groups farther along the backbone.








Abstract
Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well&#8208;defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units and therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. Their handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger&#8208;scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral &#8220;controller&#8221; groups directs foldamer twist sense. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho&#8208;phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices&#8217; termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short&#8208;range interactions that orient the controller group relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer, and then its long&#8208;range interactions with more&#8208;distant parts of the oligomer. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.

         <title>Syntheses and Reactivity of Yb and Sm Inverse Sandwich Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the YbII complex reacted as a 2e donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound SmIII complex only reacted with anthracene and COT. 








Abstract
Inverse sandwich arene complexes of rare earth metals have gained notable interest due to their unique electronic properties. In these complexes, an arene ligand bridges two metal centres, storing 0, 2, or 4 electrons, which is the basis for unique reactivity. Herein, we report on the reactivity of [(DIPePBDI)Ln]2(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;benzene) (II&#8208;Ln, Ln&#160;=&#160;Yb or Sm) and in situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) (DIPePBDI&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl). The YbII&#8208;benzene2&#8722;&#8208;YbII complex (II&#8208;Yb) reacted smoothly with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and COT, giving a range of new YbII complexes with bridging arene or COT ligands. However, due to much stronger Sm&#8208;arene bonding in II&#8208;Sm, which should be regarded as a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex, this reagent only reacted with substrates that can be reduced easily (anthracene and COT). Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a SmII&#8208;anthracene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII complex, showing that the benzene4&#8722; is able to reduce SmIII to SmII. In situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) can be considered a (DIPePBDI)SmI synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;benzene and affords a series of SmIII&#8208;arene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an SmII&#8208;pyrene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-anthracene&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex, showing that the benzene&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is able to reduce Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; to Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ reduced [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)SmI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;) can be considered a (&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)Sm&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5-triphenyl-benzene and affords a series of Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-arene&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrene&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pitch&#8208;derived Soft and Hard Carbon Materials for Practical Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of pitch&#8208;based soft and hard carbons for sodium&#8208;ion batteries from a practical viewpoint. It covers their preparation, structure, sodium storage mechanisms, and applications, while also discussing critical points such as safety and volumetric energy density. From an industrial perspective, we analyze technical hurdles and propose that combining advanced characterization with artificial intelligence is key to clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships for practical application.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, high&#8208;power and low&#8208;temperature supplies. Pitch is a promising precursor for preparing carbon anode materials for SIBs owing to its low cost, high carbon yield, and structural tunability. In this review, the preparation and application of pitch&#8208;derived soft&#8208; and hard&#8208;carbons for SIBs are discussed from a practical perspective. We first introduce the full&#8208;slope sodium storage behavior of soft carbon, mainly focused on the storage mechanism, high&#8208;rate feature, modification strategies, application scenario, and existing challenges. Thereafter, we present the preparation of pitch&#8208;derived hard carbon mainly through pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. The crucial influencing factors, including pitch property, pre&#8208;oxidation temperature, holding time, heating rate, atmosphere, and carbonization conditions, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are discussed. From scientific and industrial points of view, we also propose the challenges for application of pitch&#8208;derived carbon materials. Future efforts should be paid on clarifying the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetics of carbon, revealing the screening criteria of pitch and the &#8220;preparation&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; relationships through a combination of experiments, artificial intelligence, and big data techniques. Material design and preparation guidance should be obtained to push forward pitch&#8208;based carbon for practical SIBs.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;enabled Electricity Generation From a Single&#8208;layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

The Michael donor and the Michael acceptor are activated via hydrogen bonding interactions within the second&#8208;sphere coordination of europium complexes.








Abstract
The efficient binding of receptors Lk (Lk&#160;=&#160;L5&#8208;L8) to [Eu(hfac)3] (H&#8208;hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) allows (i) to gather the basic unit&#8208;containing tridentate ligands Lk and the acidic unit&#8208;bearing bidentate hfac&#8722; co&#8208;ligands into a stable single molecular [LkEu(hfac)3] adduct working as a catalyst for Michael C&#9472;C bond formations, (ii) to enhance the acidity of the N&#8208;H units connected to the benzimidazole side arms of the bound ligands L5 and L7, and (iii) to reorganize their geometries into cis&#8208;cis conformation for activating Michael substrates 1 and 2 through H&#8208;bonding interactions on the second&#8208;sphere coordination to provide the target product 3 (up to 92% yield). A maximum enantiomeric excess of 21% could be achieved due to the long distance between the chiral sources and the catalytic sites in the europium complexes. Stepwise distortions from planarity of the terdentate Lk ligands in the yttrium complexes [LkY(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) can be tuned by addition of specific substituent into the benzimidazole side arms, thus realizing some control over their dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission properties. All [LkEu(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) complexes display europium&#8208;centered photoluminescence properties induced by the antenna effect and modulated by the specific design of the light&#8208;harvesting aromatic ligand located in the first coordination sphere.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as a highly efficient and conceptually elegant strategy for the construction of chiral molecules from readily available prochiral substrates. This review focuses on recent developments in organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions, with particular emphasis on approaches involving bifunctional activation through hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.








Abstract
Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This mini&#8208;review focuses on strategies for &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;AAs involving Pd(II)&#8208;mediated activation of the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand&#8208;controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom&#8208;economic developments in peptide late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding via Pd(II)&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;AA residue along the peptide sequence.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;-diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;-hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2-heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal-initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2-heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
