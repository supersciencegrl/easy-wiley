         <title>Mechanically Robust and Recyclable Polyurea Networks Enabled by Dynamic Caprolactam&#8208;Urea Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of dynamic covalent bonds into polymer design offers transformative potential for sustainable materials.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic caprolactam&#8208;urea (CAU) bond that enables the construction of poly(caprolactam&#8208;ureas) (PCAU) networks with dual mechanical and chemical recyclability. The resulting PCAU networks exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness, solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Owing to the rapid dynamic exchange of CAU bonds, PCAU networks are successfully mechanically recycled via hot&#8208;pressing over multiple cycles with &gt;92% mechanical property retention. Furthermore, chemical recycling is achieved through selective depolymerization into caprolactam monomers under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions, which are directly repolymerized into new generations of PCAU networks. This work establishes CAU chemistry as a versatile platform for designing high&#8208;performance dynamic polymers with applications in circular manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternative to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8226;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8226;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying&#160;excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between&#160;radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is a characterized by the H,H &#8208;&gt; L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates:

Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; COD: &#8208;dihydrate; COT: &#8208;trihydrate) is a specific example of biomineralization due to their harmful role as kidney/urinary stones. In this work, the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates has been achieved using double diffusion technique in agar gel matrix. In&#8208;vitro experimental models for the growth of calcium oxalates can give valuable information on the formation of kidney/urinary stones. Diverse morphological forms of COM are grown in agar gel matrices ranging from platy crystallites to dumbbells and spherulites. The morphology of COM grown in agar gel resembles biogenic COM stones remarkably. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a higher pH of the agar gel promotes COD development while suppressing COM growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38% from the mixed vapors and 99.65% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that&#160;the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms.&#160;That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably&#160;higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the&#160; synergistic effect&#160;of Pd and Au atoms&#160;remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au,&#160;resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly.&#160;After optimizing, up to 61% yield of DHA was achieved at 87% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable 3&#8208;Thiocresyl&#8208;Prop&#8208;1&#8208;Enyl (TCP) Glycosides in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a glycosylation method using a shelf&#8208;stable 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides. The synthesis involves modifying an allyl glycoside with a thiocresyl moiety to secure TCP glycoside, which, upon activation with NIS&#8208;AgOTf, affords desired glycoside in good to excellent yields. TCP glycoside donors offer advantages of remarkable shelf&#8208;stability, compatibility with various protecting groups and access to both 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosides.







Abstract
Transformation of the allyl glycosides to a glycosylation&#8208;active 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides is reported herein, in an effort to devise a shelf&#8208;stable, active vinyl glycoside. Remote electrophilic activation with an iodonium source results in the formation of a glycosylation&#8208;active moiety. The efficiency of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the synthesis of a panel of di&#8208; and trisaccharides of pyranosides and furanosides, including globo&#8208;trioside Gb3 antigen, wherein a disarmed TCP glycoside is converted facile to an armed TCP glycosyl donor, further ascertaining the tolerance towards protecting group manipulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the syntheses of biologically relevant tri&#8208; and hexasaccharide oligomannans, thereby establishing the potential of this new TCP glycosyl donor for oligosaccharide synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal the remote activation of the thioether moiety by promoters, as evidenced through identification of the thioether and acrolein by&#8208;products arising from the reaction. Further, the applicability of TCP glycosides as glycosyl acceptors is also verified in glycosylations involving glycosyl halide donors. The facile isomerization of allyl glycoside, remarkable shelf&#8208;stability, tolerance towards protecting groups and applicability as a glycosyl donor, as well as glycosyl acceptor offer key advantages to TCP glycosides.

         <title>Controlled Pyrolysis of Bromine&#8208;Modulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Solvent&#8208;Free and Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates unsaturated Zn and C&#8722;Br bond as acid and base sites, respectively. The catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity with &gt;99&#8201;% propylene carbonates yield for the co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co&#8208;catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent&#8208;related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8722;Br bond. EXAFS, FT&#8208;IR and XPS analyses reveal the co&#8208;presence of unsaturated Zn sites and C&#8722;Br bonds, which act as acid and base sites, respectively. The synergy between these sites prevents bromine leakage and facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides, thereby overcoming the barriers in the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, this catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance with over 99&#8201;% yield of propylene carbonates under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The resulting propylene carbonate can be used directly as an electrolyte in battery applications without further purification. This work provides valuable insights into the modular design of heterogeneous catalysts for solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free CO&#8322; cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides an overview of advancements in confinement&#8208;aided photoredox catalysis, spanning across well&#8208;established heterogeneous frameworks to emerging homogeneous single&#8208;chain polymers. Focus is placed upon design elements that enable spatial proximity of cocatalysts which, in turn, provides optimal electron, energy, and/or radical transfers. Collectively, the architectures discussed herein underscore the importance of confinement in tackling diffusion limitations in catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript gives a deep inside in the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the N&#8208;terminal fragment of the antibiotic albicidin. This study uncovered a new structure scaffold comprising bicyclic aromatics as replacement for albicidin's methyl coumaric acid. Such variations enable the control of the resistance factor AlbA while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8208;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization is an attractive method for direct construction of synthetically important but challenging four&#8208;membered rings. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in this field over the past 20&#8197;years, including processes enabled by SmI2, n&#8208;Bu3SnH, transition metal catalysis, and photocatalyst, respectively, with an emphasis on the analysis of reaction mechanism and selectivity control.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.

         <title>31P NMR Study of P&#8208;Chirogenic Phosphaphenanthrenes with Molecular Flexibility tuned by Amino Acid Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;chirogenic phosphaphenanthrenes prepared as pairs of diastereomers served as model compounds for 31P NMR study probing the effect of molecular flexibility on NMR parameters. X&#8208;ray diffraction determined absolute configuration and revealed P&#8722;O flip of the P&#8208;ring. Interestingly, conformation of the P&#8208;ring is directed by H&#8208;bonding patterns. Conformational space was also explored by theoretical methods and diagnostic 31P parameters were investigated.







Abstract
Model phosphonamidates derived from 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;oxa&#8208;10&#8208;phosphaphenanthrene&#8208;10&#8208;oxide (DOPO) with molecular flexibility tuned by amino acid substituents were prepared as pairs of diastereoisomers (DSIs) differing in configuration on phosphorus atom. X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) determined absolute configuration on phosphorus and revealed conformational flexibility of six&#8208;membered oxa&#8208;phospha&#8208;cycle. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations combined with machine learning provided 2&#8211;4 representative conformers from each DSI present in solution. 31P chemical shift of RS DSIs was higher compared to the SS ones. Calculated 31P&#8208;1H as well as 31P&#8208;13C J&#8208;couplings followed Karplus dependence of J&#8208;coupling values on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei, showing reasonable match with the literature data. The effect of molecular flexibility quantified by parameter nConf20 on NMR parameters was significant, especially for residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), where Pearson correlation factor R decreased with increasing nConf20 parameter.

The effect of molecular flexibility quantified by parameter nConf&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; on NMR parameters was significant, especially for residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), where Pearson correlation factor R decreased with increasing nConf&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Diesel from Rapeseed Oil Esters by Sequential Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation, Double Bond Isomerization, and Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a robust, sustainable, and industrially viable three&#8208;step process to transform rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) into biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the modern diesel specifications for the use in contemporary diesel engines. This process consists of selective partial hydrogenation of RME, followed by heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed double bond isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene.







Abstract
Rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) have been converted to biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the EN 590 specifications for modern diesel engines using a robust, three&#8208;step process. In the first step, the polyunsaturated esters of the RME were semi&#8208;hydrogenated in the presence of 20&#8197;ppm of a solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd0 colloid. The resulting mono&#8208;unsaturated fatty esters were further converted into a defined mixture of double&#8208;bond isomers by passing them over inexpensive, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic Amberlyst 15 resin at high space&#8208;time yields (1.3&#8197;kg&#8901;L&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1). The resulting mixture was then converted into a blend of terminally unsaturated olefins and monoesters, with &lt;4.9&#8201;% diesters and &lt;21&#8201;% saturated fatty esters by cross&#8208;metathesis with technical&#8208;grade ethylene. In this step, 50&#8197;ppm of a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) Ru catalyst M1001 was used to achieve record&#8208;setting conversions (91&#8201;%) and selectivities (94&#8201;%). All three steps were conducted with neat feedstock at mild temperatures (60&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C). This demonstrates that sustainable diesel fuel for use in contemporary diesel engines is accessible from RME and ethylene via a short set of industrially viable reaction steps.

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of 2, 11 and 12 metal ions with a bisphosphanylphosphanide counter anion affords versatile and adaptive coordination motifs, for which NMR parameters (1JPP) serve as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool consistent with the situation in solid state as corroborated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.

         <title>The cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites to achieve high selectivity towards kinetic carbonate product for oxidative carbonylation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, which chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD&#8217;s stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8729;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH 2&#8722;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48 hours to just 3 hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding and cycloisomerization of acetylenic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones in a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand are studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The reaction mechanism and selectivity are investigated for substrates with different substituents to assess the size&#8208;reactivity relationships. The influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity and selectivity is examined using a stripped&#8208;down model.







Abstract
Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence for cancer theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally.These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid, Sustainable, One&#8208;step Mechanochemical Strategy for Synthesizing Gold Nanoparticle&#8208;Doped Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs) has garnered enormous momentum due to their unique properties and broad applications. Nevertheless, prevailing multi&#8208;step synthesis is plagued with low time efficiency, eco&#8208;unfriendliness, and tedious protocols. Herein, we introduce a rapid, sustainable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy for synthesizing AuNPs&#8208;doped COFs via steel ball milling within an hour under ambient conditions. This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi&#8208;step methods, such as extended reaction times (5 days), the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4 &#177; 0.6 nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods (6.4 &#177; 1.1 nm). Control experiments suggest that the in situ formation of AuNPs is primarily attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</dc:description>

This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi-step methods, such as extended reaction times (5 days), the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP-TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4 &#177; 0.6 nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi-step solution-based methods (6.4 &#177; 1.1 nm). Control experiments suggest that the in situ formation of AuNPs is primarily attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel. As a proof-of-concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP-TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4-nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor guest. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the host can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances of Vanadium&#8208;based Cathodes forAqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have the advantages of high safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. Various cathode materials have attracted significant attention owing to a variety of crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review focuses on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, including vanadium oxide, vanadium sulfide, vanadate and vanadium&#8208;carbon composites.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8211;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO&#8324; and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique stable signal peptide (SSP) of the Lassa virus glycoprotein complex undergoes a conformational change during pH&#8208;dependent viral fusion. This revels a potential mechanism by which the enigmatic SSP influences the fusion process through interactions it makes with the fusion protein, glycoprotein 2 (GP2).







Abstract
A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role remains to be determined due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes. We discovered that SSP is predominantly &#945;&#8208;helical in its prefusion state at pH&#8197;7. However, when the pH is lowered to mimic the late endosomal environment (&lt;pH&#8197;5), SSP undergoes a structural change, increasing its helical content. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSP directly enhances fusion at these acidic pH levels. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, which is essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate structure of ferrocene&#8208;water complexes has been unveiled using advanced rotational spectroscopy and computational methods. The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.







Abstract
The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.

         <title>Oxidative Addition&#8208;Reductive Elimination Supported by a Ligand&#8208;Element Cooperation at the Arsinidene and Stibinidene Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a remarkable reactivity of N,C,N&#8208;coordinated stibinidene and arsinidene that includes oxidative addition, tautomerization and reductive elimination steps that are allowed via so&#8208;called element ligand cooperation. The whole reaction sequence is studied form both experimental and theoretical point of view.







Abstract
The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.&#8201;e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3'Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8722;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8211;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8722;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

         <title>Structural Elucidation using Highly Sensitive Labeling Reagents and Total Synthesis of Amoxetamide A, a New Anoikis Inducer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete stereochemical determination of amoxetamide A, a new anoikis inducer, was achieved. The structure was determined by using original highly sensitive labeling reagents with consuming only trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of the unstable natural product is also reported. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its structure and anoikis inducing activity.







Abstract
Amoxetamide A is a new anoikis inducer identified in the combined&#8208;culture broth of Amycolatopsis sp. 26&#8211;4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP&#8722;B0596. Although its planar structure has been determined through extensive NMR studies, its stereochemical structure remains to be elucidated due to the limited amounts of available samples. Herein, we report its stereochemical determination using our original labeling reagents and chemical synthesis, which was realized by consuming trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of amoxetamide A is reported. Undesired intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate accelerated by the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect was completely avoided by using acyl sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its stereochemistry and anoikis inducing activity.

         <title>Kinetic Modelling and Machine Learning Approaches on the Conductance Transients of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 Sensors for Addressing Cross&#8208;sensitivity towards Ethanol and Acetone Vapors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic approach addresses ethanol and acetone vapor discrimination using wet chemically prepared Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The study explores synthesis, characterization, and sensing performance under varying conditions. Kinetic modelling and machine learning algorithms provide insights, enhancing selectivity precision and response prediction. This robust strategy advances volatile organic compound detection with improved discrimination of sensing signals.







Abstract
The accurate discrimination among various volatile organic compounds, especially ethanol and acetone possess a serious concern for metal oxide based chemiresistive sensors. The work presents a systematic approach to address the issue by utilizing superior sensing potentiality of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 coupled with efficient machine learning (ML) techniques. The work provides a thorough understanding on the synthesis, characterization of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles and evaluates their sensing performance towards ethanol and acetone vapors. The optimized sensor performance recorded under varying concentrations (100&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm) of analytes across the range of temperature (225&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C) provides lesser selectivity between acetone and ethanol. The Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood reaction mechanism was invoked further to address the selectivity issue by modelling the response transients of the sensor to get an insight into sensing interaction at a microscopic level. The estimated activation energy values of ethanol (0.26&#8197;eV) have been found to be smaller compared to that of acetone (0.34&#8197;eV), explaining little higher response of the sensor towards ethanol. Moreover, some efficient ML algorithms were employed to predictively analyze the acquired sensing data for achieving more precise discriminations between these two analytes.

         <title>Solution Processable Se&#8208;annulated Swallow Tail Perylene Bisimide Exhibiting Room Temperature Columnar Phase and Efficient Ambipolar Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide bearing swallow tail at imide position stabilizes room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. This compound exhibits ambipolar charge carrier mobility and distinguishes itself to an exclusive class of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembled liquid crystalline organic semiconductors.







Abstract
This study presents a selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide (PBI&#8208;SeST) stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. The synthesis of this Se&#8208;annulated PBI (PBI&#8208;SeST) was accomplished using the reductive Cadogan cyclization method, with the introduction of swallow tails to reduce the clearing temperature and improve solubility. In addition, the charge carrier mobility of the Se&#8208;bay annulated PBI is assessed by space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and juxtaposed with PBI as well as nitrogen and sulphur&#8208;bay&#8208;annulated PBIs. It is noteworthy that all these PBIs exhibited ambipolar charge carrier mobility, a characteristic that diverges from the prevailing literature where predominantly electron transport behavior was observed for PBIs. This distinguishes them as an exclusive category of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembling organic semiconductors.

         <title>Achieving Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Nanofluorophore for In Vivo Imaging by Inhibiting H&#8208;Aggregates Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrabright NIR&#8208;II nanofluorophore, derived from a small molecule featuring a terminal unit&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;terminal unit structure, is achieved, benefiting from the small molecule possessing an ability to prevent H&#8208;aggregates formation during self&#8208;assembly. The exceptional NIR&#8208;II brightness enables the nanofluorophore in long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging at low injection doses.







Abstract
Small molecules with an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8722;D&#8722;A) structure, featuring a fused&#8208;ring core as the donor and two electron&#8208;withdrawing end groups as acceptor units, represent a potential option for NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, benefiting from their narrow bandgaps, superior light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, and exceptional photostabilities. However, their planar conformations predispose them to forming H&#8208;aggregates during self&#8208;assembly, leading to significantly reduced fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of the resulting nanofluorophores. Herein, we report a small molecule, PF8CN, with a terminal unit&#8208;A&#8722;D&#8722;A&#8208;terminal unit structure. The terminal units of 3,5&#8208;bis(octyloxy)phenyl group result in a twisted conformation for PF8CN, preventing face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and thereby inhibiting the formation of H&#8208;aggregates. Consequently, the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence QY of PF8CN NPs is 3.8 times that of the model nanofluorophore (F8CN NPs), which contains a substantial amount of H&#8208;aggregates. The NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs is 5.3&#8208; and 14.9&#8208;times that of F8CN NPs and ICG/FBS, respectively, at an equal molar concentration. Such ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs allows us to perform long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of cerebral and hindlimb vessels, as well as the thrombolytic process. This work provides an effective method for producing nanofluorophores with ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness, positioning PF8CN NPs as a strong contender in the field of NIR&#8208;II nanofluorophores.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Yb3+, Er3+ Codoped CeO2 with Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral mesostructured lanthanides codoped CeO2 materials have been synthesized via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal route. They exhibit both circular dichroism and upconverted circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) active organic and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials have garnered increasing attention due to their vast potential applications in areas such as 3D displays, encryptions, spintronics and optoelectronic devices. However, effective methods for fabricating chiral inorganic materials exhibiting UC&#8208;CPL remain a challenge. Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of UC&#8208;CPL active chiral mesostructured CeO2 powders (CMCs) via a hydrothermal growth method, using L/D&#8208;aspartic acid as symmetry&#8208;breaking and structure&#8208;directing agents. Two levels of chirality exist in CMCs: primary nanoplates constructed from nanoparticles and the helical stacking of these nanoplates to form a twisting nanofusiform. Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be codoped into the CMCs through a one&#8208;step synthesis to achieve UC&#8208;CPL. The 1&#8201;% Yb3+, 1&#8201;% Er3+ codoped CMCs exhibited absorption&#8208;based optical activities in the range of 350&#8211;500&#8197;nm, similar to undoped CMCs, and displayed circularly polarized luminescence in the range of 520&#8211;610&#8197;nm under the excitation by a 980&#8197;nm laser. This luminescence is attributable to the energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+. This work may provide new insights into designing chiral photon upconversion inorganic materials.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;H Acylation of Benzo[h]quinolines at Room Temperature via Aldehyde Autoxidation and Palladium Catalysis Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic radical C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation is developed, utilizing the simultaneous cooperation of aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis. A key aspect of the process is the selective amalgamation of acyl radical generated by aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis via substrate&#8208;guided radical sorting. The desired acylated products are obtained in generally good yields (up to 82&#8201;%). Based on the results obtained in a series of control studies and DFT calculations, a proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle has been implicated.







Abstract
Herein, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation using aldehyde as acyl source and O2 as the green oxidant at room temperature. A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process. The reaction afforded products in good yields (up to 82&#8201;%) and it is scalable. The proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle is supported by a series of control studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Improved H2O2 Photogeneration on KBr Doped&#8208;Polymeric Carbon Nitride Via Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Path</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>

In this paper, K and Br doped carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts were synthesized by one&#8208;pot method, which is conducive to the transmission of space charge and oxygen activation, promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722;ORR.







Abstract
The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8722; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H2O2 yield of 0.05&#8197;K&#8208;CN catalyst reached 26.0&#8197;mmol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was more than 5 times that of pure g&#8208;C3N4.

         <title>Experimental Spin State Determination of Iron(II) Complexes by Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond structure correlation, the spin investigation in metal complexes is an ambiguous task. We herein present a proof of concept for the experimental determination of spin states from crystal structures by using Hirshfeld atom refinement. Relying on classical crystallographic quality indicators and residual density analysis, a novel way for the differentiation between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin is demonstrated this way.







Abstract
In this study, we present the first experimental determination of the spin state of transition metal complexes by using Hirshfeld Atom Refinement. For the demonstration, the two iron(II) complexes, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 &#8901; 6 H2O and lFe(pic)3jCl2 &#8901; EtOH were investigated. The method involves the refinement using wavefunctions of different spin multiplicity and comparison against experimental diffraction data by means of refinement indicators and residual electron density. Our results show a clear distinction between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin configurations, even for compounds with spin&#8208;crossover behavior. The presented work demonstrates the potential of Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for the experimental determination of spin states in transition metal complexes.

         <title>Water Microdroplets Promote Spontaneous Oxidation of Amino Acid&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;related Thiols to Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC text: Disulfide bonds play a significant role in multiple fields. This study shows thiol groups in amino acids or peptides spontaneously form disulfide bonds in water microdroplets without catalysts or oxygen. Hydroxyl radicals, originating from water microdroplets, facilitate this process, illustrating microdroplet chemistry&#8216;s potential for efficient disulfide bond formation.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S) play a critical role in modern biochemistry, organic synthesis and prebiotic chemistry. Traditional methods for synthesizing disulfide bonds often rely on oxygen, alkali, and metal catalysts. Herein, thiol groups involved in amino acids and peptides were spontaneously converted into symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfide bonds within water microdroplets, without the need for catalysts or oxygen, and under room temperature. Water microdroplets displayed improved selectivity for disulfide bond formation, with minimal production of other oxidative species. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) present on the water microdroplet surface facilitated the oxidation process. Thiols were firstly oxidized to thiyl radicals (RS&#8901;), which subsequently coupled to form disulfide bonds. This study highlights the potential of microdroplet chemistry as an efficient and mild approach for constructing disulfide bonds.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Continuous Flow Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride (SF5Cl) Using a Custom&#8208;Made Stirring Packed&#8208;Bed Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most widely used reagent for introducing the SF5 group onto aliphatic molecules. For this purpose, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed and allowed rapid, safe and highly efficient synthesis of SF5Cl. Moreover, the following radical addition of SF5Cl on alkynes in a telescoped manner was realized.







Abstract
The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5&#8722;) group has been the subject of a surge of interest in the past decade, but there is still little practicality associated with its synthesis and installation. Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most common reagent for the synthesis of SF5&#8208;substituted compounds. The synthesis is based on inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents: sulfur powder (S8), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and potassium fluoride (KF). To this end, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed to allow for fast, safe, and highly efficient on&#8208;demand synthesis of SF5Cl. The resulting SF5Cl solution is showcased in the radical addition on alkynes in a telescoped fashion.

         <title>Reductive Zincke Reaction: Opening of Pyridinium Rings to &#948;&#8208;Amino Ketones via Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine ring&#8208;opening reaction, reductive Zincke reaction, is described, which allows various pyridinium compounds to be ring&#8208;opened to afford saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, with a simple rhodium catalyst under mild transfer hydrogenation conditions. The versatility of the reaction is further demonstrated in the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds.







Abstract
The Zincke reaction and Birch reduction have been one of the few reactions that allow for ring opening of pyridines ever since the discovery of pyridine more than a century ago. This paper presents a new addition to the list of pyridine ring&#8208;opening reactions, reductive Zincke reaction, which affords saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones. Under the catalysis of a simple rhodium complex, pyridinium salts with diverse substituents are reduced with formic acid, ring&#8208;opened with water, transaminated with a secondary amine and further reduced to afford a wide range of &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, including those in which the alkane chain of the ketones is selectively deuterated or fluorinated. The applicability of the reaction is exemplified by the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules.

The applicability of the reaction is exemplified by the synthesis of drug analogues and late-stage modification of drug molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay of cTnI with Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal Covalent Organic Framework and Dual DNAzymes Cascade Amplification Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>

A porous structural Ru&#8208;MCOF acts as a microreactor with a nanoconfinement effect, accelerating co&#8208;reactant diffusion and promoting ECL emitter excitation. Combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, an ECL immunosensor was constructed for sensitive cTnI detection with high sensitivity and accuracy. The high&#8208;stable Ru&#8208;MCOF opens a new approach for the exploitation of MCOF&#8208;based luminophores for early clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris (4,4&#8242; &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2&#8242; &#8208;bipyridine) ruthenium (II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.

Synthesis and exploration of the catalytic potential of taurine&#8208;functionalized carbon quantum dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade.







Abstract
Taurine&#8208;functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S&#8208;doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8211;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau&#8208;CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10&#8197;cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E&#8208;factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non&#8208;toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau&#8208;CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.

         <title>Unusual Reaction of Isocyanides with Aromatic Aldehydes Catalyzed by a Supramolecular Capsule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron poor aromatic aldehydes leading to the corresponding imine and carbon monoxide was disclosed to be promoted by the hexameric self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule. The mechanism was elucidated considering kinetic investigation, isotopic labelling, metadynamics calculations and intermediate synthesis.







Abstract
The supramolecular resorcinarene hexameric capsule efficiently promotes the unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic aldehydes leading to the formation of imines and carbon monoxide. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated via isotope labelling, kinetic analysis of the reaction, computational studies and the independent synthesis of a proposed intermediate. Control experiments indicate that the formation of the key aziridinone intermediate is limited to the cavity of the capsule.

         <title>Photoexcited Hantzsch Ester Anions Enabled C&#8722;F Bond Activation and Hydro&#8208;Difluoroalkylation of Arylethylenes Through Dual&#8208;SET Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hantzsch ester (HE) is a classic reductant used for single electron transfer (SET) and/or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). However, there have been only a few examples involving the highly reducing properties of the photoexcited HE anion. One guiding idea, the installation of electron donor groups (EDGs) on the HE moiety to prepare super&#8208;reductants, has not yet been explored. In this study, we report the C&#8722;F bond activation and hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes via a dual&#8208;SET process enabled by Hantzsch ester anions under blue light irradiation. This method demonstrates excellent compatibility with both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl&#8208;CF3, enabling synthesis of a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkanes, including the bioisostere. Mechanistic studies indicate that, in addition to the established SET process of Hantzsch ester anions, a key secondary SET process from the Hantzsch ester radical generated in the first SET also occurs.







Abstract
In this study, we reported a new approach to activate the C&#8722;F bond of trifluoromethylarenes to achieve the hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes using photoexcited Hantzsch esters (HEs) anions. A wide range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkanes was synthesized. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and synthesis of bioactive molecule bioisostere were also presented. Mechanistic studies revealed that the dual&#8208;single electron transfer (SET) process of HEs anion was the key to this reaction.

The reactivity of a pentacoordinate nickelacyclobutane following addition and one&#8208;electron oxidation pathways is described. Ring&#8208;opening products are observed with substrates containing a stabilizing counteranion. Pathways leading to an oxidized nickelacyclobutane yield [2+2] cycloreversion&#8208;type products, suggesting that this pathway is accessible to oxidized nickelacyclobutanes.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are reactive intermediates in catalytic cycles including cyclopropanation and insertion reactions. The stoichiometric study of these intermediates has shown that their reactivity is highly influenced by the coordination environment of the nickel center. A pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane embedded in a diphosphine pincer ligand has been shown to selectively undergo various reactions with exogenous ligands, including [2+2] cycloreversion and carbene transfer to an isocyanide. Herein, we investigate the reactivity of the pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane towards addition and oxidation reactions. Addition reactions lead to ring&#8208;opening to form stable square planar Ni(II) compounds, while metal oxidation enhances [2+2] cycloreversion. DFT calculations are used to shed light on the different mechanisms.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Memory and Durable Transparent Polyacrylate Film Integrated by Soft&#8208;Rigid Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>

This work presents a rational design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) films with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability, for making the fabrication of transparent flexible displays or other flexible devices. The films are prepared by free&#8208;radical polymerisation of vinyl&#8208;terminated PU prepolymer as cross&#8208;linking agent and various acrylate monomers with the soft rigid chains under UV light.







Abstract
Flexible film in display requires multi&#8208;functional integration, such as stretchability, flexibility, abrasion resistance, transparency, and shape memory. In this paper, a reasonable design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) film with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability is presented. The PA films are prepared by free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyurethane (PU) prepolymer as a cross&#8208;linking agent and acrylate monomers in ultraviolet (UV) light. The various acrylate monomers in PA films with different functional groups (e.&#8201;g. epoxy groups, benzene rings) provide soft&#8208;rigid chains and hydrogen bonds, which improve overall mechanical and optical properties. The experimental results also effectively demonstrate that after folding performance (500 cycles) or abrasion resistance (1000 cycles), the transparency of PA film remained above 91&#8201;%. In addition, the PA films with different folded shapes also prove excellent shape memory, which can fix the folded shape at low temperature and then return to the original shape at room temperature. Notably, the PA film is successfully applied to the curved touch screen through drawing, pattern decoding and image magnification in the simulation practical demonstration, fully revealing its great significance as a flexible substrate in the development of future flexible displays.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multicentric DIL@PDIL Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversion to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicentric DIL@PDIL catalyst was efficiently synthesized from five readily available starting materials in one&#8208;pot. The multicentric catalyst possessed high ion density and demonstrated satisfactory catalytic performance under mild conditions. The [TMGH]+, Br&#8722;, &#8208;COO&#8722;, and imidazole cation of the gemini DIL were found to synergistically facilitate the CO2 cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
Among the various studies on CO2 utilization, the sustainable and cost&#8208;effective fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates remains one of the most intriguing subjects. To this end, a novel type of composite dicationic ionic liquid material, DIL@PDIL, was developed. This composite consists of a dicationic ionic liquid (DIL), DMAP[TMGH]Br, supported on a polymeric dicationic ionic liquid (PDIL), P&#8208;DVB/Im[TMGH]Br. The multicentric high&#8208;ion&#8208;density material was prepared with exceptional efficiency from five readily available starting materials in one pot through simultaneous quaternization, neutralization and polymerization. The structure was characterized using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, SEM, TGA, ICP&#8208;MS and BET, as well as through stepwise synthesis verification. Evaluation of the catalytic performance revealed the ionic liquid composite delivered chloropropylene carbonate (CPC) in excellent yield and selectivity from either pure CO2 or simulated flue gas at 60 &#176;C and relatively lower pressure. Additionally, the DIL@PDIL catalyst exhibited good recyclability and were applicable to a range of epoxide substrates. The high activity of the the catalyst could be attributed to the abundant [TMGH]+ hydrogen bonding donors and Br&#8722; anions, which synergistically catalyze the epoxide ring&#8208;opening, as well as the abundant &#8208;COO&#8722; groups and imidazole cations, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2.

         <title>Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt&#8208;Doped Nickel (Oxy)Hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anodic activation of NiCo Prussian blue analog yields a highly active Co&#8208;doped Ni(O)OH catalyst with nanosheet architecture, enabling efficient and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This catalyst achieves up to 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the production of benzoic acid and industrial&#8208;level current densities at low applied potential, outperforming conventional pristine Ni and Co&#8208;based analogs.







Abstract
Water&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)&#8208;based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet&#8208;like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi&#8208;LDH, demonstrating that the PBA&#8208;derived Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was more effective.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized Porous Organic Polymers for Bromine Adsorption and Selective Separation from Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>

Bromine causes significant environmental pollution, contributes to ozone layer depletion, and coexists with iodine as IBr. In this study, we have developed an electron&#8208;rich porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2) containing heteroatoms that effectively adsorbs bromine and shows selectivity over iodine. The efficient adsorption of bromine is facilitated by non&#8208;covalent charge transfer interaction, specifically physisorption with the POF&#8208;2 network.







Abstract
Bromine is a significant environmental threat due to its corrosive nature and contribution to ozone layer depletion. It often coexists with iodine and forms interhalogen complexes (IBr), which require an effective and selective bromine adsorption strategy. Leveraging the electrophilic nature of bromine, we designed an electron&#8208;rich thiophene&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2). This material exhibits exceptional efficiency for bromine adsorption (2.86&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rapid uptake kinetic from aqueous solutions, driven by noncovalent charge transfer interactions. POF&#8208;2 also demonstrates selective capture of bromine from a bromine&#8208;iodine mixture in cyclohexane. The material's electron&#8208;rich sites exhibit a stronger orbital interaction with the &#963;* orbital of bromine compared to iodine, leading to the observed selectivity in cyclohexane.

         <title>Achieving Precise Control Over the Molecular Periphery of Dibenzoixenes Through Modular Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>

We report rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structures. The edge structures of these molecules were not only thoroughly analyzed by spectroscopic techniques, but also evaluated by their applications in Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both finite forms of graphene, are promising organic semiconducting materials because their optoelectronic and magnetic properties can be modulated through precise control of their molecular peripheries. Several atomically precise edge structures have been prepared by bottom&#8208;up synthesis; however, no systematic elucidation of these edge topologies at the molecular level has been reported. Herein, we describe rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structured. The single&#8208;crystal structures of dibenzo[a,p]ixene and dibenzo[j,y]ixene reveal enantiomeric pairs with helically twisted cove edges and packing structures. The molecular edge structures are identified from the C&#8722;H bonds of the dibenzoixenes using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with different vibrational modes, which were further explained using density functional theory calculations. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicates that the zigzag&#8208;edged molecular periphery significantly affects the magnetic properties of the material. Furthermore, the electrochemical characteristics, examined using dibenzoixenes as anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, reveal that the dibenzo[a,p]ixene exhibits promising Li intercalation behaviors with a specific capacity of ~120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The findings of this study could facilitate the synthesis of larger

         <title>Photocatalytic Multiple Deuteration of Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives Using Deuterium Oxide</title>

Supporting information for this article is given via a link at the end of the document.We successfully established a multiple deuteration for PEG derivatives via photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in the presence of TBADT using D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. The mechanistic study using DFT calculation etc. revealed deuteration reactivity. This first accomplishment of multiple deuterium incorporation to PEG skeleton will contribute to develop the future deuterium science and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Deuterated molecules are of growing interest because of the specific characteristics of deuterium, such as stronger C&#8722;D bonds being stronger than C&#8722;H bonds. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely utilized in scientific fields (e.&#8201;g., drug discovery and material sciences) as linkers and for the improvement of various properties (solubility in water, stability, etc.) of mother compounds. Therefore, deuterated PEGs can be used as novel tools for drug discovery. Although the H/D exchange reaction (deuteration) is a powerful and straightforward method to produce deuterated compounds, the deuteration of PEGs bearing many unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has not been developed. Herein, we report the photocatalytic deuteration of multiple sites of PEGs using tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. This deuteration can be adapted to PEG derivatives bearing various substituents ((hetero)aryl, benzoyl, alkyl, etc.). The deuteration efficiencies of the &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the terminal positions of the PEGs were strongly influenced by the substituents. These reactivities were elucidated by density functional theory calculations of the reaction barriers towards the formation of radical intermediates, induced by the excited state of TBADT and the PEG substrate. In addition, the applicability of deuterated PEGs to internal standard experiments and Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated.

         <title>Property Tuning in N&#8208;Methylpyrrole Azo&#8208;Photoswitches via Modification of the Peripheral Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches was designed and prepared to comprehensively address the substitution effect on the photoswitching performance. By selecting proper substituents, the switching ranging from seconds to hours can be achieved along with a large tuning of thermal, (non)linear optical, and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Differently substituted pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches were prepared in a straightforward synthetic way. Their fundamental properties were investigated by XRD analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, Hyper&#8208;Rayleigh Scattering, and NMR spectroscopy; the experimental results were further corroborated by DFT calculations. Thermal robustness, the HOMO/LUMO levels, and the absorption properties were altered mostly by substituting the N&#8211;methylpyrrole moiety and further fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the benzene substituents. The pyrrole substituent also proved crucial for the second&#8208;order non&#8211;linear optical (NLO) response as well as the photoswitching performance. Both fast and slow molecular switches can be designed with the half&#8211;life of the (Z) &#8211;isomer ranging from 48&#8197;seconds to 23.28&#8197;hours and the E/Z molar ratio up to 12/88. This comprehensive study allowed elucidation of the fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships and subsequently addresses the key aspects of the property tuning via substitution in molecular azo&#8208;photoswitches.

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>

The relaxation pathway and excited state dynamics of [Ru(N3)(N2)(PTA)]2+ type Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls containing phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligand PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) from the photogenerated excited state suggested the involvement of 3MC excited state. The effect of N&#8208;methylation of the PTA on the photophysical properties and excited state relaxation dynamics of the complexes was rationalized.







Abstract
Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp=p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and PTA=1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470&#8197;nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77&#8197;K, luminescence bands at ~600&#8197;nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The differences in the photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ were rationalized by DFT calculations. The transient absorption spectroscopic analysis was used to unravel the relaxation pathway of the complexes, suggesting the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. The MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470&#8197;nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.

However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77&#8197;K, luminescence bands at ~600&#8197;nm were observed. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in [Ru(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; {[&lt;b&gt;1-Me&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;} (MePTA=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane). The differences in the photophysical and electrochemical properties of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;1-Me&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; were rationalized by DFT calculations. The transient absorption spectroscopic analysis was used to unravel the relaxation pathway of the complexes, suggesting the involvement of the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. The MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non-cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470&#8197;nm blue LED. The non-toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP-MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Modulation of Bridged Single&#8208;Benzene&#8208;Based Fluorophores for Materials Science</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library consisting of five single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores was designed. Changing the bridging atoms between oxygen and nitrogen significantly impacts the photophysical properties in solution, the solid&#8208;state, and 3D&#8208;printed materials. This results in high quantum yield values and environmentally insensitive behavior. Using the full&#8208;color range of these compounds, white light emission was attained utilizing stereolithography.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers studying fluorogenic samples have steadily shifted from using large, expensive, poorly soluble fluorophores with complex synthetic sequences to smaller, simpler &#960; scaffolds with low molecular weight. This research article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties of five bridged single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores (SBBFs) investigated for their solution and solid&#8208;state emission (SSSE) properties. The compounds O4, N1O3, N2O2, N3O1, and N4 are derived from a central terephthalonitrile core and vary in the amount of oxygen and nitrogen bridging atoms. These minimalized emitters show full&#8208;color tunable emission properties and exhibit moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield values reaching up to 0.78 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition to demonstrating excellent compatibility in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA), white light emission was achieved in both solution and 3D&#8208;printed materials by controlling the mixing ratio of the compounds. Employing density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), well&#8208;correlating theoretical absorption and emission wavelengths were calculated as average values of the different possible conformers. Furthermore, cellular internalization of the substances was accomplished using Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127 nanoparticles. Overall, this study emphasizes the remarkable properties of single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based emitters, showcasing their accessibility and potential applications in biomedical fields and materials science.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]Uril&#8208;Stabilized Charge Transfer: An Efficient Supramolecular Approach Toward a Heterogeneous Organic Photocatalyst for Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest complexes of cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) with viologen derivatives in aqueous solution could be switched by the substituted electron donor moieties, where the host&#8208;guest complexes exhibited effective HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex as heterogeneous catalysts has the stronger ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) in organic solvents.







Abstract
Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] and d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94&#8201;%).

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, was achieved through a straightforward two&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The electronic buffering mechanism provided by CeO2 enhanced the oxygen affinity at the surface of the heterojunction material, accelerated electron transfer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In overall water splitting, the CeO2@NiFe LDH demonstrated excellent activity and stability.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotentials amount to 255&#8197;mV in 1&#8197;M KOH, 263&#8197;mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346&#8197;mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200&#8197;hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Polyferrocenylmethylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polyferrocenylmethylenes was prepared via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP), starting from the corresponding carba[1]magnesocenophanes. Different substitution patterns have been investigated with regards to the polymers&#8217; properties and gave some insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the polyferrocenylmethylenes were investigated as preceramic polymers.







Abstract
The synthesis of differently substituted polyferrocenylmethylenes (PFM) via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP) is reported. A number of novel, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been prepared, which were used as precursors and allowed investigations of the influence of different substitution patterns on the PFM polymer properties. The novel carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, and structurally authenticated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The corresponding PFMs were obtained with molecular weights in a range of Mw=1900&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 up to 15100&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and corresponding dispersities of &#272;=1.48 to 1.81. All PFMs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis of spyrocyclic substituted PFM resulted in a ceramic yield above 50&#8201;%, while the obtained residue was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD).

         <title>MOF Derived Cobalt Ferrite Cubic Rod&#8208;Like Materials for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOF&#8208;derived CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material prepared by solvothermal method shows mainly a uniform cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a small amount of hexagonal structure at a Co/Fe molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical detection performance in the simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metal ions (HMIs). An interaction mechanism is found to exist between HMIs when simultaneous detection.







Abstract
A series of CoFe2O4 materials derived from metal&#8208;organic framework were successfully constructed by the solvent&#8208;thermal method. The morphology of a typical sample CoFe2O4&#8208;1 was mostly in the form of a cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a size distribution of 3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;m, while a small amount of the structure presented hexagonal shape with uniform size dispersion. The XPS characterization results confirmed that the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material contained Co3+ (Co2+/Co3+=0.98), and the redox reaction between Co2+ and Fe3+ produced more Fe2+ (Fe2+/Fe3+=1.63), leading to the production of more OV on the surface of the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material (OV%=0.34), thereby facilitating the efficient adsorption of the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions (HMIs). CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE as a typical electrode presented excellent performance for the detection of multiple HMIs. The results should be attributed to the good electrical conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area of CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE, accelerating the transport of ions and charges in the system. Interestingly, there are interaction mechanisms between the HMIs when performing simultaneous detection, suggesting the detection of target ions can be facilitated by adding additional ions. This study provides new research insights for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical sensors for real&#8208;time environmental monitoring.

         <title>Defluorinative Diazolation&#8208;Cyclization Relay for Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Bridged Triheterocycles and Colorimetric Sensor Application</title>

A strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles was developed. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component protocol was achieved through successive C(sp3)&#8208;F bond functionalization of one trifluoromethyl group, which is recognized for its stability and durability. Moreover, the synthetically useful functionalities such as bromide and formyl group could be easily installed on the resulting products, and the imidazole&#8208;containing FBTH could serve as a valuable ligand in the preparation of an advanced colorimetric sensor, thereby underscoring their potential applications.

         <title>Tuning the Duplex Stability of DNA Oligonucleotides Containing Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs of Imidazole&#8208;Derived Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs comprised of HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and/or CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate) induces a significant thermal stabilization of DNA with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII. The thermal stability is dependent on the identity of the artificial base pair and added metal ion, as well as the pH value.







Abstract
Two artificial imidazole&#8208;derived nucleobases, HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate), were introduced into short DNA duplexes to systematically investigate their thermal stability upon metal ion coordination. Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs are formed with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as with the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII, which induce a thermal stabilization of up to 8&#8201;&#176;C upon binding. The latter are the first lanthanoid&#8208;mediated base pairs involving only four donor atoms that result in a significant duplex stabilization. For the 3d metal ions, the increase in DNA melting temperature is in agreement with the trend in complex stability according to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. The duplex stabilization upon metal&#8208;mediated base pair formation depends on the identity of the artificial base pair, enabling discrimination between metal ions by systematic design of the duplex. Further, the influence of pH on the stability of selected duplexes was studied, revealing a linear relation between pH and the formation of HQIm&#8211;NiII&#8211;HQIm base pairs and allowing to induce a distinct stabilization between 1&#8201;&#176;C and 28&#8201;&#176;C. Regarding EuIII&#8208;mediated base pairs, an acidic pH can be utilized to disturb their formation, presumably by promoting the coordination of EuIII to the DNA backbone.

Further, the influence of pH on the stability of selected duplexes was studied, revealing a linear relation between pH and the formation of &lt;sup&gt;HQ&lt;/sup&gt;Im&#8211;Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;sup&gt;HQ&lt;/sup&gt;Im base pairs and allowing to induce a distinct stabilization between 1&#8201;&#176;C and 28&#8201;&#176;C. Regarding Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated base pairs, an acidic pH can be utilized to disturb their formation, presumably by promoting the coordination of Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; to the DNA backbone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Synergism in NiMoO4/FeOOH Heterostructure for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. In which, a thin FeOOH layer would provide greater electrochemical activity with less charge transfer resistance, and the entire FeOOH layer is close to the interface with NiMoO4 would provide electron an electron highway for electron transfer to further improve the electric conductivity of FeOOH.







Abstract
FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266&#8197;mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and excellent stability over 100&#8197;hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5&#8197;nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Graphene Oxide as a Self&#8208;Carbocatalyst to Facilitate the Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Glycidol for Efficient Polyglycerol Grafting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of polyglycerol (PG) onto graphene oxide (GO) is initiated by: 1) a spontaneous reaction of epoxide with carboxyl groups at the edge of GO and those oxidized from aldehydes, and 2) a GO catalyzed reaction of the epoxides with the hydroxyl groups. GO also catalyzes the subsequent polymerization of glycidol on growing PG to afford a ramified PG macromolecule with a random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology.







Abstract
Grafting carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CNMs) with polyglycerol (PG) improves their application potentials in biomedicine and electronics. Although &#8220;grafting from&#8221; method offers advantages over &#8220;grafting to&#8221; one in terms of operability and versatility, little is known about the reaction process of glycidol with the surface groups onto CNMs. By using graphene oxide (GO) as a multi&#8208;functional model material, we examined the reactivity of the surface groups on GO toward glycidol molecules via a set of model reactions. We reveal that carboxyl groups spontaneously react with the epoxide ring with no need of catalyst, while GO catalyzes the reactions of hydroxyl groups with the epoxide of glycidol. In addition, the hydroxyl group of glycidol can open the epoxide in the basal plane of GO. The subsequent polymerization of PG is supposed to propagate at the primary and/or the secondary hydroxyl groups, generating a ramified PG macromolecule with random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology. In addition, ketones, benzyl esters and aromatic ethers are found not to react with glycidol even in the presence of GO, while the aldehydes are easily oxidized into carboxyl groups under ambient condition, behaving then as the carboxyl groups. Our findings pose the foundation for understanding the polymerization mechanism of PG on CNMs.

         <title>Selective Decarboxylative Fluorination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Acids in Aqueous Media: 19F&#8208;NMR&#8208;Assisted Batch Optimization and Transfer to Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of API relevant &#945;&#8208;fluoro ketone phenacyl fluoride is finally described as a catalyst&#8208;free continuous flow process. This selective decarboxylative monofluorination is optimized in batch mode for aqueous and biocompatible conditions varying temperature, additives, and pH. Furthermore, benchtop NMR PAT was used for fundamental studies to a better understanding of the mechanism of the decarboxylative fluorination as well as the reaction pathways to &#945;&#8208;difluorinated ketone derivatives.







Abstract
The selective decarboxylative fluorination of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropionic acid is used as a benchmark reaction to optimize it under biocompatible conditions in batch and to transfer it to continuous flow mode. The reaction conditions are varied with respect to temperature, fluorinating reagents, inorganic base additives, and pH, as these parameters have been identified as having a significant impact on the process. The formation of the products and any by&#8208;products is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Once optimal conditions have been determined, the reaction is carried out using an automated continuous laboratory synthesis system that features a mesostructured capillary reactor and an integrated 19F&#8208;NMR spectrometer for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction. The work presented here represents the initial phase of a multi&#8208;step continuous flow process that will include additional biocatalyzed downstream reactions in future applications.

We found that unique (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups had axial chirality. Although racemization of an enantiomer of a representative compound was observed even at a low temperature, a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog showed stable axial chirality. Those compounds showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives with potential axial chirality were synthesized from rhodium complexes bearing aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands. A cyclic dimer obtained by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog exhibited persistent axial chirality. Furthermore, the chiral cyclic dimer demonstrated solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Maeda, T.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Adaptive Molecular Crystals Activated by [2+2] and [4+4] Cycloadditions</title>

Photomechanical crystals of [2+2] or [4+4] cycloaddition: This article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals act as light&#8208;driven material&#8208;machines that can convert the energy carried by photons into kinetic energy via shape deformation or displacement, and this capability holds a paramount significance for the development of photoactuated devices. This transformation is usually attributed to anisotropic expansion or contraction of the unit cell engendered by light&#8208;induced structural modifications that lead to accumulation and release of stress that generates a momentum, resulting in readily observable mechanical effects. Among the available photochemical processes, the photoinduced [2+2] and [4+4] reactions are known for their robustness, predictability, amenability to control with molecular and supramolecular engineering approaches, and efficiency that has already been elevated to a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart devices based on organic crystals. This review article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions. It consolidates the current understating of the chemical strategies and structure&#8211;property correlations, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of this class of adaptive crystals within the broader field of crystal adaptronics.

         <title>Endowing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Induced Supramolecular Chirality by Engineering Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is a crucial noncovalent binding force prevalent in many biological and chemical systems, however, are rarely reported in chiral supramolecular systems. Here, a supramolecular chiral system is reported, wherein cation&#8208;&#960; interaction play significant roles. The interaction involves a chiral cationic palladium complex (R&#8208;Pd) co&#8208;assembling with 12 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in the formation of supramolecular gels in mixed solvents. This co&#8208;assembly induces supramolecular chirality in the PAHs, with cation&#8722;&#960; interaction identified as the primary driving force. The confirmation of this interaction is supported by high&#8208;resolution mass, 1H NMR, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), XRD and CD. Most importantly, with the synergy of hydrogen bonds, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be stabilized in a mixed solvent containing water, leading the co&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular gel, as well as enhanced chiral induction of PAHs. This discovery serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle example showing how the weak cation&#8722;&#960; interaction could be a powerful guide in attaining induced chirality of PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of [3]Rotaxanes with Two Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) Axles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound where phenylene units are directly connected at the 1,4&#8208;positions. Utilizing the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic dihydrodibenzophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex, we succeeded in the synthesis of [3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with PPn axles by biaryl coupling. The size of the macrocycle was critical to synthesize [3]rotaxanes, which consist of two oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles, in good yields. The relationship between the length of the PPn structure on the 1H NMR spectra of the rotaxanes was studied. The aggregation of a PP8 derivative was suppressed by the presence of the macrocycle in the rotaxanes. A [3]rotaxane could be considered as a model compound of an aggregated PPn, and the photophysical studies disclosed the influence of the aggregation on the properties of PPn.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligo(para-phenylene) (PPn) is a &#960;-conjugated compound where phenylene units are directly connected at the 1,4-positions. Utilizing the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic dihydrodibenzophenanthroline-Ni complex, we succeeded in the synthesis of [3]- and [2]rotaxanes with PPn axles by biaryl coupling. The size of the macrocycle was critical to synthesize [3]rotaxanes, which consist of two oligo(para-phenylene) axles, in good yields. The relationship between the length of the PPn structure on the 1H NMR spectra of the rotaxanes was studied. The aggregation of a PP8 derivative was suppressed by the presence of the macrocycle in the rotaxanes.

         <title>Zinc Sensing with a Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 14, March 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original paramagnetic probe was developed, whose Magnetic Resonance Imaging efficacy is modified upon Zn2+ complexation. A combination of NMR, DFT and luminescence studies shows that these changes are due to a modification of the Gd3+ coordination sphere. The complex exhibits high selectivity for Zn2+ over other physiological cations.







Abstract
Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Ultrafast UV Photochemistry of Aliphatic Disulfides in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the photochemistry of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in solution upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation in comparison to L&#8208;cystine by femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K&#8208;edge. For these aliphatic disulfides, the very similar differential absorption spectra reveal unequivocally a pair of geminate thiyl radicals as the single primary reaction product with a formation time constant of about 100 fs. We find size&#8208;dependent majority yields for disulfide recombination with DMDS reforming ten&#8208;fold slower and at lower quantum yield than L&#8208;cystine while GSSG recombines even faster than L&#8208;cystine at a yield of nearly 80 % within 2 ps after excitation. We attribute the much lower recombination rates and yields of DMDS to larger product separation after homolytic S&#8208;S bond cleavage due to the smaller thiyl radical mass and correspondingly larger mutual acceleration. Furthermore, we observe the delayed formation of at least one additional reaction product of these disulfides that we attribute to perthiyl radicals. The ultrafast recombination of L&#8208;cystine and GSSG at majority yield in condensed phase suggests a dynamic S&#8208;S bond integrity which may be exploited in natural systems to mitigate UV radiation damage, and which could be of interest in materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#160;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8208;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8208;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R = Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8211;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14.</dc:description>

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase&#160;(pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD&#160;site with two histidines&#160;and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a&#160;potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage&#160;complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural&#160;mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic&#160;oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to&#160;aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Isoindolines to Tetralins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.







Abstract
We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N&#8208;atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that demonstrates a unique dimerization through external molecular binding is reported. A trispap ligand with multiple inward chelating units realized the alignment of the metals and coordination sites. Replacement of the original acetate cap with phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, which binds to the complex in a tripodal mode, generated an electrically&#8208;neutral moiety with available sites and facilitated dimer formation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free 3D Cell Imaging Using Hydrogels Functionalized with Switchable Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free imaging of cells in a 3D scaffold was achieved using switchable Ir&#8208;complexes, covalently linked to a hydrogel. The presence of unstained cells induces the &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; of the luminescence from the Ir&#8208;complexes, allowing clear visualization of living cells.







Abstract
The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. Iridium functionalized hydrogels are very weakly luminescent when immerged in culture media. When cells are added to them, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel boronic ester radical precursor, two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical were bridged with an axially chiral spacer for the first time. The resulting, diradical (R/S)&#8208;1 demonstrated high stability in solution under ambient conditions and exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 10&#8201;%, along with circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chloroform.







Abstract
Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, structural water molecules can form an interface electronic state with &#960;&#8208;bonding properties due to the spatial interaction of the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms at the nanoscale, thus acting as emitters for the bright photoluminescence of thiolate&#8208;gold complexes.







Abstract
The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R=&#8722;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30 min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;ring methodology to control the conformations of macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pseudo&#8208;ring is a medium&#8208;sized cyclic structure, held together by a strong hydrogen bond, that can act as a mimetic of a covalently linked heterocycle. Molecules that contain pseudo&#8208;rings can switch between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; forms. This paper examines the utility of pseudo&#8208;ring constructs to control conformations and properties of macrocycles. The spectroscopic evidence suggests that the &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; pseudo&#8208;ring&#8208;containing macrocycles differ in their three&#8208;dimensional characteristics, which results in markedly different lipophilicities. The dynamic nature of pseudo&#8208;rings has led to the emergence of tunable fluorescence that should be useful in environment&#8208;sensitive applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;light Responsive Fluorescent Liposomes for Controlled Release&#160; of Carbon monoxide (CO) with Cytotoxic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signalling molecule. CO&#8208;releasing molecules/materials (CORMs) have been studied as a source of CO for therapeutic abilities. In this study, new fluorescent turn&#8208;on CO&#8208;releasing nanoscale liposomes are formulated and their CO&#8208;releasing potentials are studied under red light (625 nm).&#160; New amphiphilic fluorescent naphthalic anhydride appended with a manganese carbonyl complex (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM) has been reported for the red light controlled release of CO with fluorescent turn&#8208;on emission.&#160; To enhance the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of Nap&#8208;BpyCORM, we incorporated it with bilayer phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol to form nanoscale liposomes. The red&#8208;light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing ability of the liposomes was investigated by UV&#8208;vis, emission, and IR studies and myoglobin assay. The rate of CO release (t1/2 = 11.13 min) was observed to be slower in the case of the liposome that contains cholesterol (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves.1) compared to the liposome (t1/2 = 6.96 min) that only has DPPC (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves). Incorporation of cholesterol into liposomes has increased the stability of CORMs. New liposomes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, but in the presence of light, they show toxicity to cancer cells.&#160;These findings open new avenues for the development of light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing compounds with improved biocompatibility and applicability in various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction using polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially under low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator&#160;of TMSD reaction.&#160;We show that PQ2 could&#160;drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold.&#160;Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with&#160;sub&#8208;nanomolar&#160;input has been successfully demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic amplifiers.&#160;By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations,&#160;PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar&#8208;level inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining a desired single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer TMSD circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes.&#160;The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications&#160;from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Guest Molecules Containing Rich&#8208;electron Group Incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the Enhancement of Iodine Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest molecules with rich&#8208;electron groups are successfully incorporated into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF to obtain two composites, which exhibit higher iodine uptake capacities than the pristine one. The iodine adsorption kinetics and possible adsorption mechanism by these above mentioned materials are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the major iodine species of iodine&#8208;loaded complexes are also characterized.







Abstract
Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL=(R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them were 1448 and 1680&#8197;mg/g at 75&#8201;&#176;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4&#8197;times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept highlights our efforts to develop efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange methods, directing the controllable syntheses and structural determinations of more than 200 metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters, also known as ultrasmall nanoparticles, represent a promising class of nanomaterials due to their atomically precise characterizations and intriguing chemical&#8208;physical properties. The preparation is the cornerstone for advancing the nanocluster science, facilitating their structural determination, property investigation, and practical application. We have been devoted to exploring new and efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties. We have proposed and developed four methodologies for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure&#8208;property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with several feasible synthetic routes.

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene produces a [Sn4]4&#8211; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5p orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5p orbital on tin.







Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.

         <title>Rational Construction of a Pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b] Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Smart AIE Material: A Theoretical Insight into Fluorescence Switching Mechanism of the Chimeric Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explored a chimeric design strategy to integrate bisthienylethene into a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3] benzothiazole AIEgen (PBTE) as the head group. The ultrafast intramolecular FRET which outcompetes the nonradiative decay was identified as the dominant channel for fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. The excellent AIE photoswitching capability enabled its applications in erasable optical memory and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8211;MS Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analytical characterization of homo and co&#8208;polyesters: We have engineered a cutinase from T. cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) to improve its thermostability and catalytic performance and applied it along with the LCCWCCG enzyme to carry out the chemoselective hydrolysis of aromatic/aliphatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. An analytical workflow based on RPLC&#8208;UV&#8208;MS and SEC&#8208;MS provided insight into the monomer selectivity in the hydrolysis of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91&#8201;&#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analytical characterization of homo and co-polyesters&lt;/b&gt;: We have engineered a cutinase from &lt;i&gt;T. cellulosilytica&lt;/i&gt; (Tc_Cut2NV&lt;sup&gt;WCCG&lt;/sup&gt;) to improve its thermostability and catalytic performance and applied it along with the LCC&lt;sup&gt;WCCG&lt;/sup&gt; enzyme to carry out the chemoselective hydrolysis of aromatic/aliphatic homo- and co-polyesters. An analytical workflow based on RPLC-UV-MS and SEC-MS provided insight into the monomer selectivity in the hydrolysis of co-polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from &lt;i&gt;Thermobifida cellulosilytica&lt;/i&gt; (Tc_Cut2NV&lt;sup&gt;WCCG&lt;/sup&gt;) for improved thermostability (up to 91&#8201;&#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC&lt;sup&gt;WCCG&lt;/sup&gt;) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo- and co-polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo-polyesters. SEC-MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co-polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end-group composition. These results underline the importance of co-polymer composition in the biodegradation of co-polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4&#8208;stabilizing agents for drug development.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;Tm values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT&#8208;8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives as selective G4&#8208;stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.

         <title>Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral CYCNOLs have been developed. The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Formation of 2D multi&#8208;layered sulfur sheets from 0D sulfur dots with improved crystallinity, effective light harvesting, less exciton binding energy with effective free charge carriers separation for efficient photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co&#8208;catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending &#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide the straightforward synthesis of new azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. These experimental findings were further supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, providing valuable insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960; system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X&#8208;ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.

         <title>New Cytotoxic Derivatives by the Phosphorylation and Phosphinoylation of Diethyl &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Methylphosphonates</title>

In order to make available potentionally bioactive new &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were phosphorylated, phosphinoylated and thiophosphinoylated with the corresponding P&#8208;chloride. The effect of a P=O to P=S modification was evaluated by single crystal X&#8208;ray cristallography. Among the phosphorylated and phosphinoylated aminophosphonates a few derivatives revealed moderate cytotoxic effect.







Abstract
In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Synthesis, and Structural and Spectroscopic Analysis of Trielyl&#8208;Derived Complexes of Iron</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron aluminyl&#8208;, gallyl&#8208; and indyl&#8208;derived complexes of the type [(NON)EFe(CO)4]&#8722; (E=Al, Ga, In; NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) have been synthesized, and the properties of the group 13 metallo&#8208;ligands compared by a combination of crystallographic, computational and IR/M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic techniques.







Abstract
The reactivity of group 13 anions of the form [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene, E=Al, Ga, In) towards Fe(CO)5 has been investigated. In the case of the aluminyl system, both reaction outcome and product structure are highly sensitive to the availability of the potassium counterion; sequestration by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is necessary to yield a species featuring a direct, unsupported Al&#8722;Fe bond. 2.2.2&#8208;Cryptand, by contrast, yields a species featuring bridging carbonyl ligands, while the use of no sequestering agent at all leads to isocarbonyl bridging to aluminium. Owing to their lower oxophilicity, the heavier congeners gallium and indium more straightforwardly deliver Fe&#8722;E bonded adducts (E=Ga, In). The series of trielyl iron complexes has been interrogated by structural and computational analyses, as well as by IR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies, revealing a consistent shift in bond polarity and electron richness at iron as group 13 is descended. This in turn is consistent with the diminishing donor strength of the trielyl ligand with increasing atomic number.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of 48&#960; nonaphyrins, a novel class of planar expanded porphyrinoids exhibiting distinct redox properties compared to their 32&#960; congeners. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal a heterocycle dependent structural planar topology in these macrocycles. These nonaphyrins display weak paratropic ring current effects and undergo reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield the 46&#960; dicationic species. Unlike the 32&#960; congeners, these 46&#960; dications have been characterized as diradicalod in nature.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;((6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8208;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28 V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8208;1.05 V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2'&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step.

         <title>Working mechanisms for enhanced interface stability and electrochemical properties in dual&#8208;salt polymer electrolyte with in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8208;cathode integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li//Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000 h at at 0.1 mA cm&#8211;2@0.1 mAh cm&#8211;2. LiFePO4//Li full cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.5 C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90% at 0.5 C after 100 cycles) at 60 &#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ecofriendly synthesis of a hybrid hydrogel incorporating silver nanoparticles: Biological and photocatalytic activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid material comprising silver nanoparticles embedded within a 3D hydrogel network. The use of an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis as a natural reducing agent facilitates the synthesis process. Acanthus mollis is a perennial, invasive and leafy plant that is widely distributed across the planet. Sequential introduction of silver nitrate solution and the plant extract into the hydrogel yielded a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100 &#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites in porous aromatic frameworks via multivariate strategy for ReO4&#8208; capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radioactive waste discharge from nuclear facilities has attracted extensive attention on effective capture from used nuclear fuel. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized through a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and used for ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. Because these materials have varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8208; adsorption. PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98% of ReO4&#8208; within 2 min, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 707 mg g&#8208;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8208; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective radioactive waste disposal approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using&#160;Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900 cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10 ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14 &#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4 &#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287 cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D = 0.1001 cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.e. the efficient ISC is resulted, but triplet state lifetime become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of complexed molecules through intramolecular hydrogen bond to facilitate chemical reactions is an applicable strategy in organic synthesis. Among the lactones, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones is a class of biologically active and important structures. In this work, a series of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were synthesised in a green and efficient manner by carbonylation of alkenes. This reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of lactones containing natural product modules. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is imperative for enhancing the nucleophilicity of the large steric alcohol, which are challenge to lactonize. The existence of intramolecular hydrogen bond was proven with the aid of FT&#8208;IR and NMR characterisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Hetero&#8208;Bimetallic Azurin Photoenzyme for Photoredox Nitrite Reduction and SNO Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis in protein systems presents exciting opportunities to achieve sustainable and efficient enzymatic reactions driven by light. Here, we report the design and characterization of PhotoNiR, an engineered azurin&#8208;based protein incorporating a red copper center and a lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT). This dual&#8208;metal system enables photoredox reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide via a proposed donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism. Upon photoirradiation, aromatic residues in the LBT donate electrons to the lanthanide ion, which relays them to the Cu(II) center, reducing it to Cu(I). The reduced Cu(I)&#8208;PhotoNiR catalyzes the reduction of NO2&#8208;, and the generated NO subsequently reacts with free cysteine residues to form S&#8208;nitrosothiol (SNO) species. Spectroscopic and structural characterization confirmed that the copper center retains the properties of a red copper site and that the lanthanide&#8208;binding tag supports efficient electron transfer. This work represents one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A mechanism in a protein system, demonstrating the potential of integrating metalloprotein engineering with lanthanide photochemistry to develop novel photoenzymes for light&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of feedstock azine starting materials in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products has had a storied history that has resulted in some of the most efficient syntheses to date. The use of aromatic building blocks not only has economic value, but implicit synthetic advantages towards concise synthesis and accessing broader molecular diversity.







Abstract
Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pertechnetate and perrhenate auto&#8208;reduce, leading to coordination geometries suitable for polyoxometalate (POM) assembly. Evaporation of pertechnic acid leads to the prior&#8208;reported [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722;. Evaporation of perrhenic acid yields (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O, the first evidence for Re auto&#8208;reduction, prior known for the lighter group VII congeners. Combined perrhenate and pertechnetate yield the [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; polyanion, the first group VII mixed&#8208;metal POM.







Abstract
Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8722;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8722;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8722;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides and its Application in the Synthesis of Scleropentaside A, Scleropentaside B and the Derivatives of Dapagliflozin</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides is developed through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling and isomerization, which is subsequently applied in the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glucosides and their derivatives demonstrate significant SGLT2 inhibitory activity, making them potential candidates for diabetes treatment.







Abstract
C&#8208;Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of O/N&#8208;glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross&#8208;coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base&#8208;assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of C&#8208;glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers: A New Concept for Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBPs, with a unique backbone entirely composed of bonded metal atoms, offer promising quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity. This Concept highlights their potential for the advanced thermoelectric materials, with recent progress, challenges, and future directions discussed.







Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal-backboned polymers, emerging as one-dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal-backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco-friendly energy technologies are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formal Umpolung Strategy for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Amides via &#945;&#8208;Sulfenylnitro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient umpolung strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;branched amides using nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents, and amines has been developed. This strategy utilizes only readily available reagents. Key advances include the one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitroalkanes, optimized oxidative amidation, and a demonstration of a wide substrate scope. In addition, the sulfenylnitro scaffold offers notable advantages in terms of reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Amide compounds are essential structural motifs found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides and materials. A novel formal umpolung strategy for an efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched amides was developed, employing nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents and amines as reacting components. The synthesis involves the formation of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro intermediates, which undergo oxidative amidation under optimized conditions using tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and K2CO3 as a base. The key intermediate, an &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro compound, was successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot operation. This methodology demonstrates a broad substrate scope, accommodating various amines, including primary and secondary amines as well as amino acid derivatives, and yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;branched amides in high efficiency. The sulfenyl nitro scaffold proved particularly effective, offering both stability and reactivity. The developed process simplifies the preparation of &#945;&#8208;branched amides and expands the accessible structural diversity.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Aziridination to Synthesize Spiro&#8208;aziridine Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an efficient asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates for the construction of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles. A readily available chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(OTf)2 complex catalyst was identified to afford the corresponding products in good yields with high ee values. The stereospecific ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles enable the formation of glycinate&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates has been established. The reaction using a chiral nickel complex catalyst enabled the formation of a series of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee, &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) under mild reaction conditions. Ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindole leads to formation of glycinate&#8208;bearing oxindoles with retention of configuration.

         <title>A Tetrazine&#8208;Based Synthesis for Accessing Underutilized Aza&#8208;Indole Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;indole functionalities fill an important role in drug discovery. While indoles are considered privileged scaffolds, aza&#8208;indoles allow for better pharmacological properties and on&#8208;target activities. Synthetic approaches to access aza&#8208;indoles are limited, with pyrazolopyridazines being some of the scarcest aza&#8208;indoles. To provide access to these underutilized cores, a synthetic approach utilizing a reaction cascade between a protected propargylhydrazine and dichlorotetrazine has been developed. In addition, a variety of methods were developed to access each position on the core for late&#8208;stage functionalization. This method offers an expedited synthetic route to a rare aza&#8208;indole scaffold with superior physiochemical properties when compared to indole analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Photophysical Path to the Triplet State in Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage (LOV) Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon blue&#8208;light absorption, LOV domains efficiently undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state. The efficiency of this ISC is&#160;said to arise from a&#160;heavy atom effect of the nearby (eventually adduct&#8208;forming) cysteine. However, LOV domain derivatives missing the cysteine residue still undergo ISC efficiently. Using hybrid multireference QM / MM&#160;models, we investigated the effect of the electrostatic environment in a prototypal LOV domain, AtLOV2, compared to the effect of the dielectric of an aqueous solution. We find that the electrostatic environment of AtLOV2 is especially well tuned to stabilize a triplet (nN,&#960;*) state, which we posit is the state driving ISC. Other low&#8208;lying triplet states that have (&#960;,&#960;*) and (nO,&#960;*) character are ruled out on the basis of energetics and / or orbital character. The mechanistic picture that emerges from the calculations is one that involves the ISC of photoexcited flavin to a (nN,&#960;*) state followed by rapid internal conversion to a triplet (&#960;,&#960;*) state, which is the state detected spectroscopically. This insight into the ISC mechanism provides guidelines for tuning flavin's photophysics through mutations that alter the protein electrostatic environment and potentially helps explain why ISC does not occur readily in many classes of flavin&#8208;binding enzymes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we synthesized two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN, which exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions with distinct optical properties influenced by the solvent environment. (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;DMF displays bright orange luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 57.1%, while (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN emits red luminescence with a PLQY of 17.4%. Notably, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN achieves a maximum dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3, attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between organic and inorganic components. Reversible transformations between these two phases via solvent vapor stimulation enable dynamic photoluminescence (PL) switching, highlighting their application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. Furthermore, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting devices (CPL&#8208;emitting devices) based on these materials were fabricated, achieving a maximum |glum| of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8208;3. These findings underscore the potential of these chiral HMHs for advanced applications in chiral optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and CPL&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via A Novel Metal Ion&#8208;Modulation Approach: A Complementary Approach to Linker&#8208;Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP&#8208;MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal&#8208;ligand coordination and created the defect&#8208;mesopores during the solid&#8208;state transformation process, resulting in HP&#8208;MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP&#8208;MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing&#8208;linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP&#8208;MOFs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks (HP-MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP-MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal-ligand coordination and created the defect-mesopores during the solid-state transformation process, resulting in HP-MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP-MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing-linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP-MOFs. Beyond this, the metal modulators can be co-assembled into the HP-MOFs, functionalizing HP-MOFs with new metal active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of prepared hierarchically porous ZIF-8-Pd was tested, it presented superior catalytic activities towards hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Base&#8208;Labile Linkers for Convenient Synthesis, Purification, and Functional Group Introduction in Solid&#8208;Phase Glycan Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are essential biomolecules across species, but their structure&#8208;property relationships remain poorly understood. Pure oligosaccharide samples are crucial for studying these properties, and their preparation heavily relies on chemical synthesis. The linker used for attaching the oligosaccharide to the solid support is essential during solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. Here, we present three base&#8208;labile linkers compatible with Merrifield resin. The first type of resin, containing a hydroxyhexanoic acid linker, can be prepared in a one&#8208;step synthesis and releases glycans with a terminal carboxylic acid after methanolysis and hydrolysis. Linkers on the second and third types of resin can be synthesized through simple chemical reactions and cleaved to reveal either a free reducing end of the oligosaccharide or a terminal amine with a C5&#8208;spacer. The phthalate structure in the second and third types of resin is sensitive to sodium methoxide and can also be cleaved during hydrazinolysis. Hydrazinolysis, rather than methanolysis, enables the isolation of oligosaccharide with pivaloyl ester protection and facilitates the purification process compared to partially protected compounds. Using these resins, we prepared nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide, including &#945; (1&#8208;6) mannan, &#945; (1&#8208;4) glucan, &#946; (1&#8208;4) glucan, and &#946; (1&#8208;3) glucan.</dc:description>

         <title>Method and Mechanistic Insights to 1,2&#8208;Aminochlorinate Alkenes using Blue&#8208;Light Activated Dichlorocarbamates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue light activation of N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates facilitates a direct 1,2&#8208;aminochlorination of unactivated olefins to yield 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;Cl compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates undergo a photochemical excitation to yield a neutral nitrogen&#8208;centered radical, which rapidly reacts with olefins in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion. Using this method, a range of functionally diverse substrates are successfully aminochlorinated to yield the corresponding 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;Cl compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Pachinko: Probing Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer of St. John&#8217;s Wort&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Photosensitizer Hypericin with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypericin from St. John&#8217;s wort has been used as a potent photosensitizer, but its working mechanism remains elusive which hinders its rational design for improved functionality. We implement ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum calculations to track the excited&#8208;state dynamics in an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of hypericin in solution. Using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), we track excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) via a previously unreported blueshift of a long&#8208;wavelength stimulated emission (SE) band with excitation&#8208;dependent dynamics in various solvents, owing to the dominant Q7,14 tautomer that undergoes bidirectional ESIPT. This finding is corroborated by ground&#8208;state femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (GS&#8208;FSRS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, contrasting the neutral and anionic forms of hypericin enables us to reveal an intramolecular charge transfer step underlying ESIPT. We demonstrate UV and visible excitations as an integral platform to provide direct insights into the photophysics and origin for phototoxicity of hypericin. Such mechanistic insights into the excited state of hypericin will power its future development and use.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8211;)&#8208;Myrioneurinol employing a "resolutive" late&#8208;stage Barton&#8208;McCombie Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so&#8208;called Barton&#8208;McCombie reaction is a transformation commonly used in organic synthesis for promoting deoxygenation of alcohols. Almost 50 years after its discovery, this reaction has become a powerful tool for organic chemists due to its wide range of applicability and functional group tolerance, which allows, with high level of anticipation, its incorporation into complex synthetic routes such as the ones aiming at the total synthesis of natural products. In this article, we describe the first example of a resolutive version of this reaction by using a chiral chlorothionate as the activating reagent, and its related strategic potential through a late&#8208;stage application in view of the total synthesis of both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid featuring 5 contiguous stereogenic centers.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small carbohydrates present a rich and complex conformational landscape whose accurate description is a significant challenge for computational molecular science, yet essential for understanding their physicochemical properties, biological roles, and medical implications. Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) is a notable example of a disaccharide that remains insufficiently characterized despite being implicated in the life&#8208;threatening anaphylactic response known as alpha&#8208;Gal syndrome. Here we present a thorough conformational analysis of &#945;&#8208;Gal using a unique combination of techniques, ranging from classical dynamics to a staged automatic conformer generation and screening using a quantum&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based protocol elaborated in the present work. The results reveal a remarkably constrained and rigid conformational profile that is minimally responsive to solvation. Subsequently, we study the binding of &#945;&#8208;Gal to the M86 antibody using multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations. Quantum mechanical analysis of the binding in terms of non&#8208;covalent interactions, local energy decomposition, and quantities derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enable us to identify and quantify the key interactions that form the structural basis of &#945;&#8208;Gal&#8217;s immunological response.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Structurally Complex Marine Cyclopropyl&#8208;Diterpenoids: Peyssonnoside A and Its Aglycon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peyssonnoside A is a marine&#8208;derived sulfated diterpenoid glucoside featuring a remarkable 5/6/3/6 tetracyclic skeleton with a highly substituted cyclopropane ring deeply embedded in its structure. Herein, we report on the full development of the first total synthesis of this natural product and its aglycon, peyssonnosol. Through the experimental evaluation of a series of synthetic strategies, including utilization of Ohloff&#8211;Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization and C&#8208;H allylation, we identified a concise, efficient, and highly diastereoselective route. Key steps in the synthesis of the aglycone peyssonnosol include a Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and a Mukaiyama hydration, both guided by the inherent spatial features of the substrates. This optimized approach enabled the synthesis of peyssonnosol in 12 steps and 21% overall yield and provides a robust framework for accessing structurally complex marine natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Upgrading Electron Transfer with High Conductivity MOF Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising energy storage devices, offering flexibility and smart functionalities to meet the growing demands of modern applications. However, challenges such as limited conductivity and stability continue to hinder their performance. Herein, a conductive composite was designed by forming one&#8208;dimension rod&#8208;like conductive MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on the hierarchical nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugated system between Ni2+ and HHTP establishes a robust electron delocalization network, significantly enhancing the conductivity and stability of the MOFs. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Ni&#8208;HHTP with Ni&#8208;OA effectively reduces internal electron transfer impedance, improving charge transport within the delocalized electronic networks. The synthesized Ni&#8208;OA@Ni&#8208;HHTP&#8208;6//AC achieves a remarkable energy density of 24.78 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 113.03 W kg&#8208;1, with a peak power density of 2924.58 W kg&#8208;1 at an energy density of 19.68 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of oxalate@conductive&#8208;MOF composites, paving the way for energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Generation of Sumanene&#8208;Based AIEgens for the Effective Recognition of Metal Cations in Solutions Containing 95 vol% of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the application of sumanene derivatives for the optical detection of metal cations was demonstrated. Unfortunately, known sumanene&#8208;based receptors enable the detection process in purely organic solutions or in aqueous media containing not lower than 50 vol% of organic solvent. Designing easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors able to effectively recognize metal cations in aqueous solutions containing a slight volume fraction of organic solvent remained an important and vital challenge. In this work, we show that water&#8208;insoluble sumanene receptors composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms enable the effective detection of cesium (Cs+) or lithium (Li+) cations in solutions containing 95 vol% of water. Their key feature is related to the exhibition of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. We discovered that the designed sumanene receptors exhibit excellent detection parameters expressed by Stern&#8208;Volmer constant values at the level from 108 to 1010 M&#8722;1. This work also shows that by simple modification of the sumanene receptor structure, it is possible to drastically change its detection preference from large Cs+ cations to small Li+ cations. The highest sensitivity of the designed receptors was concluded for Na+ or Li+, depending on the receptor structure. This work opens new avenues in designing sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cation of Tris(Triarylamine) Connected through 1,2,3&#8208;Benzenetriyl Bridge: A Three&#8208;Redox&#8208;Center Organic Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>

         <dc:description>
To explore intramolecular charge transfer pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) radical cation, in which three triarylamine redox&#8208;active&#8208;centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been prepared, and a combination of experimental (optical absorption and ESR spectroscopy) and theoretical analyses (density functional theory calculations) unveiled optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer processes for the radical cation as a nondegenerate multi&#8208;dimensional MV compound.







Abstract
To explore intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) (TTA), in which three triarylamine (TA) redox&#8208;active centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been newly synthesized. The MV state of the TTA radical cation has been investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, and the ICT pathway between three redox&#8208;active centers has been revealed. The intervalence CT (IVCT) band analysis gave an electronic coupling value comparable to the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(triarylamine) radical cation. Dynamic electron spin resonance studies clarified that the TTA radical cation was a nondegenerate MV system exhibiting ICT between the central TA and the peripheral TAs through the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridge.

A double photochemical cryo thiol&#8208;ene coupling process was developed as a general method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thio&#8208;linked di&#8208; and oligosaccharides. The procedure includes i) UV&#8208;initiated coupling reaction of 2&#8208;substituted glycals with HSAc in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C in frozen state, ii) selective S&#8208;deacetylation of the resulting glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SAc derivatives, iii) cryo thiol&#8208;ene reaction of the obtaining &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars with 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;glycals.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Glycosyl thiols are key building blocks for the formation of stable thioglycoside mimetics of widespread and biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides, which urges their efficient synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that the photoinitiated radical&#8208;mediated addition of thioacetic acid to 2&#8208;substituted glycals followed by selective S&#8208;deacetylation is a generally applicable and fully stereoselective method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosyl thiols. The low reactivity of thioacetic acid in the radical reaction was overcome by carrying out the reaction in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, in frozen state, with UVA irradiation, achieving high yields irrespective of the sugar configurations. For effective irradiation and simultaneous effective cooling, a self&#8208;made spiral vessel reactor was used, which also enables large&#8208;scale synthesis. By subjecting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars to a second thiol&#8208;ene coupling reaction with 2&#8208;substituted glycals, 34 trehalose&#8208;type symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thiodi&#8208; and oligosaccharides were obtained with full stereoselectivity. Moreover, the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars provided an easy access to &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diglycosyl disulfides.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving a hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif has been reported as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by modulating substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level, proposing a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.







Abstract
Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Toughened Polymer Networks: The Mighty Impact of Specially Designed Rings on Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;shaped compounds, such as 2D metallacycles and 3D cages, possess fixed geometric structures, adsorption capabilities, and reversible dynamic properties. When specially designed rings are incorporated as crosslinking points or integrated into the backbone structure, they can significantly improve the mechanical properties of polymer networks by releasing hidden lengths and undergoing conformational changes. This review summarizes recent research progress in regulating the mechanical properties of polymer networks through the introduction of ring structures.







Abstract
Polymer network materials are gaining significance in daily life and industrial applications. Improving polymer network materials&#8217; mechanical properties has long been a focus for chemists and materials scientists. Generally, rings in networks are viewed as adverse elements leading to reduced mechanical performance. In this conceptual article, recent advancements and related strategies in utilizing specially designed rings to enhance the mechanical properties of polymer networks are summarized and discussed. The article concludes by discussing current challenges and future prospects in this field. We aim for this article to offer readers an overview of ring&#8208;toughened polymer networks and to catalyze swift progress in this burgeoning area.

         <title>An Oxoiron(IV) Complex Supported by an N&#8208;alkylated Cyclam Ligand System Containing a Pendant Alcohol Moiety.</title>

         <dc:description>The effect of a pendant neutral alcohol moiety in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) ligand backbone is examined for the non&#8208;heme mononuclear oxoiron(IV) unit in [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC&#8208;HOR)(NCCH3)]2+ (1&#8208;syn) (TMC&#8208;HOR = 2&#8208;(4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecan1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol). Unlike in the related [FeIV(Oanti)(TMC&#8208;SR)]+ (3&#8208;anti) (TMC&#8208;SR = 1&#8208;mercaptoethyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex, bearing an axial mono&#8208;anionic thiolate ligand trans to the oxo unit, the alcohol moiety in 1&#8208;syn stays protonated and does not axially coordinate to iron. The protonation of the alcohol moiety is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the oxoiron(IV) core; it presumably serves as a hydrogen bonding donor to the oxoiron(IV) unit, which is positioned syn to the three methyl groups. Comparative reactivity studies reveal 1&#8208;syn to be a stronger hydrogen atom abstraction but weaker oxygen atom transfer agent relative to the [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC)(NCCH3)]2+ (2&#8208;syn) complex, bearing the N&#8208;tetramethylated cyclam (TMC) ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Malonate&#8208;Based Iodonium Ylides to Generate Dihydrofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While iodonium ylides are important reantants in a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Diborane(4) Reactivity: Lewis Acid to Bind Lewis&#8208;Basic Substrates and Electron Donor For Substrate Reduction Through Stimulated Diborane&#8208;Substrate Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208; and dibromido&#8208;diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8208;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono&#8208; and dicationic pyrazine&#8208;diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fluoride Ion Affinity Revisited: Do We Need the Anchor&#8208;Point Approach?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large and diverse high&#8208;level benchmark data set of computed gas&#8208;phase fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) for 71 small main&#8208;group Lewis acids is presented. It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor&#8208;point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self&#8208;interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor&#8208;point approach based on OCF2 has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor&#8208;point calculations based on Me3Si+ even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break&#8208;down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor&#8208;point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, direct computations of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions are the clearly preferable route.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanosecond Hyperquenching, a Novel Method of Specimen Preparation for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major challenge in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) is preparing the protein specimen without the artifacts caused by the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Here, we introduce nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) &#8211; a novel method of artifact&#8208;free specimen preparation. The fast narrow jet impinges liquid cryogen at 77 K and breaks up, forming 30 &#8211; 150&#8208;nm&#8208;thick vitrified films. NHQ films with protein particles are formed directly in the liquid cryogen, which precludes AWI tension&#8208;driven protein adsorption, preferred orientation, subunit dissociation and denaturation. The formed film surfaces are essentially specimen&#8208;free, with a 2.7&#8208;nm&#8208;thick protein depleted layer of hyperquenched glassy water (HGW). This &#8220;surface sealing&#8221; appears to be the first essential stage of vitrification at NHQ conditions; it occurs in about 35 ps on cryogen encounter. We outline the depletion mechanism, where the growing HGW layer displaces protein particles from the surface inwards the film.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent interactions of surface adsorbed species control the self&#8208;assembly of calcinated nickel oxide nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two&#8208;dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in&#8208;depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non&#8208;polar faceted. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the surface&#8208;adsorbed non&#8208;dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling. Interactions between water molecules adsorbed on two vicinal NiO NPs are responsible for keeping the self&#8208;assembly of the Ni(OH)2 NPs upon heat treatment. In carbamide&#8208;based NiO NPs, the self&#8208;assembly of initially formed Ni3(OH)4(NO3)2 NPs is not preserved. These NPs are terminated with polar (111) atomic planes, on which water molecules dissociatively adsorb, giving surface hydroxyl groups. As the hydrogen bonding proton &#8211; donating and accepting abilities are negligible at OH&#8208;polar terminated NiO NPs, only unfavorable inter&#8208;NP interactions are possible which leads to disruption of the NP assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Catalysis Using Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process in C&#8722;H bond functionalisation catalysis, allowing the formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The progress made in this field is addressed, highlighting the role played by specific metals in its development, and recaps the state of the art in the application of OIRE chemistry in transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process to enable the effective formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically triggered oxidation of appropriate metal complexes leading to a reductive elimination process otherwise chemically unfavorable has long been studied in stoichiometric metal&#8208;centered reactions. However, its conscious inclusion and targeted application in catalysis is a rather recent development. Ruthenium and Group 9 metal complexes are particularly representative examples of how the observed OIRE abilities can be modulated using different coupling partners. Parallels can be drawn between rhodium and iridium, which have a long history as efficient catalysts, and their more readily available 3d row metal neighbor, i.&#8201;e. cobalt, with ruthenium also providing a matching reactivity. This review explores the history of OIRE reactions throughout the last few centuries, highlighting the role of Ti, Mo, Fe, Hg, Ni, Ru and group 9 transition metals as key players in C&#8722;H bond functionalization and OIRE chemistry, discussing the most relevant studies published in the field whilst pinpointing research gaps that require new theoretical and mechanistic studies, with the final goal of unlocking the full potential of OIRE chemistry in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis and Structural Reidentification of Alstrostines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of alstrostines was accomplished in 18 or 19 steps using our proposed bioinspired strategy. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea&#8197;luxurians was reidentified and named epialstrostine A.







Abstract
Alstrostine A and isoalstrostine A are monoterpenoid indole alkaloid glycosides with unique structures found in the plant families Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae. With molecular weights exceeding 900, nine chiral centers (excluding sugar rings), and complex fused&#8208;ring structures, the structural elucidation of these molecules using spectral analysis is highly challenging. Therefore, their structural identification through total synthesis is important in both natural product chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, we successfully accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of these alkaloids in 18 or 19 steps. A key synthetic feature was a two&#8208; or three&#8208;component coupling reaction between secologanin and a pyrrolidinoindoline moiety based on our proposed biosynthetic pathway. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea luxurians (Rubiaceae) was successfully reidentified and renamed as epialstrostine A.

         <title>Quinones as Multifunctional Scaffolds for Oxidative, Reductive, and HAT Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinone scaffolds facilitate light&#8208;driven redox transformations across a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V, supporting oxidative, reductive, and HAT reactions. Oxidative and HAT processes occur under ambient air, while reductive transformations require an inorganic base. Their adaptability to facilitate a broad range of radical and ionic processes under just two conditions highlights the potential of quinone scaffolds in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis, which enables both electron and hydrogen atom transfer, has become a powerful tool for activating chemical bonds and synthesizing complex molecules under mild conditions. Typically, photocatalysts are optimized either for oxidative or reductive reactions within a limited redox window (less than 3.1&#8197;V) and for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions, with few frameworks capable of mediating both pathways for high redox&#8208;demanding reactions (covering more than a 5&#8197;V redox window) without requiring special conditions. Herein, we report the use of quinones as multifunctional scaffolds in light&#8208;driven redox transformations, offering access to a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V using visible light. The quinone scaffold's versatility facilitates a wide range of radical and ionic processes under both oxidative and reductive conditions, in addition to enabling HAT reactions. By keeping the parameters, i.&#8201;e. the reaction partners, constant, such transformations can be carried out under just two reaction conditions. Oxidative transformations and HAT reactions occur under ambient air, while activation of the chromophore for reductive transformations can be achieved using an inorganic base (Cs2CO3) via a simple acid&#8208;base deprotonation event. This dual capability highlights the potential of quinones as scaffolds to extend their utility in photoredox catalysis.

Peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents: A hybrid molecular innovation combining scalable synthesis and enhanced solubility. Optimized variant A4B2 excels in thermal stabilization and electron microscopy studies of key membrane proteins, setting the stage for advanced detergent design.







Abstract
Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide-scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein-coupled receptors, including A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;AR, SMO and GLP-1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;AR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide-based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Alkylation Reactions That Construct Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers and Tune C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) Bond Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers that construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, which ease the rotation of the bond between the central chiral carbon and the dihydrobenzofuranone moiety, have been developed. The products have the benefits of the central chiral center and the flexibly rotatable bond to locate a part of the moieties at various positions for interacting with other molecules.







Abstract
In molecules with central chiral centers functionalized with aryl groups, the rotation of the single bond between the aryl group and the central chiral center may be hindered. Enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers to construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters resulting in easing of the rotation around the axes are described. We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Stable Cations and Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread deployment of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) energy conversion devices requires AEMs with robust alkaline stability. In the race for alkaline stability, &#8220;cationic athletes&#8221; are forging ahead, and cyclic ammonium&#8208;based AEMs are emerging as frontrunners. This concept summarizes the current state of development among various alkali&#8208;stable cations, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future developments in this field.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted attention as an innovative technology due to their advantageous alkaline catalytic kinetics and cost&#8208;effectiveness. AEMs play a crucial role in these devices and have shown significant progress in terms of ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, alkaline stability, and other essential characteristics. Nevertheless, their durability remains a limiting factor preventing the large&#8208;scale deployment of AEMs based devices. The attack of hydroxide ions on the cations is an inherent issue that needs to be addressed to enhance the lifetime of the AEMs. Therefore, the design of more stable cationic groups is essential to maintain the initial properties of AEMs and extend the device lifetime. This concept systematically summarizes the development and stability enhancement strategies of the cationic groups for AEMs in recent years, with particular emphasis on the emerging cyclic cationic groups. Furthermore, the stability differences of cations in small molecules versus AEMs are systematically discussed, as well as prospective research toward stable AEMs.

         <title>Novel Space&#8208;Crowded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Molecules for the Fabrication of Efficient Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tailored blue luminscent molecules with through&#8208;space charge transfer feature are synthesized and characterized. They exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence, and can not only function efficiently as emitters in blue OLEDs but also serves as host materials for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitters, providing narrow blue electroluminescence spectra and excellent device efficiencies.







Abstract
Currently, the advance of high&#8208;resolution display device puts a high requirement for the development of efficient luminescent materials emitting high&#8208;quality blue light. But stable blue luminescent materials with high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and narrow emission spectra are still rare. In this work, two efficient blue molecules (mCPTC and 2mCPTC) are developed by linking large&#8208;volume electron donors of 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and electron acceptor of 2,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DPTRZ) on the 3,6&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)carbazole holder through benzene bridges. Their thermal stability, crystal and electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical property, charge transport ability and EL behaviors are thoroughly studied. They hold high structural rigidity and through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics between donor and acceptor, and exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence. They can not only function as emitters in OLEDs to radiate deep blue light, but also serve as efficient hosts for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter v&#8208;DABNA, providing narrow EL spectra and excellent EL efficiencies of 24.21&#8201;%, much higher than those in common host without sensitizers. These results demonstrate the good potentials of these blue molecules in the fabrication of efficient narrow&#8208;spectrum blue OLEDs.

         <title>Identification of Two Distinct Stereoselective Lysine 5&#8208;Hydroxylases by Genome Mining Based on Alazopeptin Biosynthetic Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes that catalyze regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are valuable for pharmaceutical production. Two lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2) that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively, were identified by genome mining. Several lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases in the genome database were also characterized. Stereoselective dehydrogenases for (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine were also discovered.







Abstract
Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed in&#8197;vitro. Here, we identified two &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate/Fe2+&#8208;dependent dioxygenases in Actinosynnema mirum and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine and four lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5&#8208;hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.

The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is reduced within the tumor microenvironment (TME), allowing cancer to evade detection and eradication by immune cells. We developed a novel co&#8208;culture assay that replicates the immunosuppressive TME conditions to facilitate the discovery of compounds that can prevent NK cell inhibition and identified effective modulators, with different mechanisms of action.







Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.

         <title>Understanding the Photophysical Properties of Pd and Pt Transition&#8208;Metal Isocorroles: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computed photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, allow us to indicate these compounds as possible candidates in photodynamic therapy. In particular, Density Functional Theory results clearly show that the Pt&#8208;10 and Pd&#8208;10 complexes are able to generate of excited O2 (1&#916;g) and superoxide O2.(&#8722;) via type I and type II reactions.







Abstract
The main photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, characterized and proposed as potential photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, have been investigated and rationalized using density functional theory and its time&#8208;dependent formulation. Both the 5 and 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers have been considered. In addition to determining the minimum energy structures of the ground and excited states, we have calculated the excitation energies, spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants, nonradiative intersystem crossing rate constants and two photons cross section. Also, the type I PDT mechanisms have been considered. Results show that the photoactivity of both Pd and Pt complexes mainly depends on their singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, which is necessary to promote the O2

 excitation. The study of the photophysical properties of the free ligands indicates that this trend is common for both the free and Pt&#8211; and Pd&#8211;isocorroles. The production of superoxide ions (O2.(&#8722;)) is possible only for the 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers.

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8722;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium&#8208;Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 reduction to NH3 on Au22Ru6 cluster without sacrificial reagent. The Ru&#8208;doped Au cluster effectively reduces N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium under ambient pressure and temperature conditions owing to the bifunctional nature of that nanocluster. The Ru dopant of the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster assists in binding the N2 molecule while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are involved in facilitating nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecules to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory), we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed to achieve this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are implicated in facilitating NRR.

Crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks can afford high photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane performance.







Abstract
Photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is an appealing approach to produce ethane and hydrogen, however, most developed photocatalysts still suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can afford high photocatalytic NOCM performance in a flow reactor under UV&#8208;visible light irradiation. The characterization results show that engineering the TiO2 crystal phase can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and promote the formation of &#8901;CH3 intermediate, thus achieving the improved performance of photocatalytic NOCM reaction. This research provides a new perspective towards the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for NOCM reaction.
