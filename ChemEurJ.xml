         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1:1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed H2S Probe and Scavenger for Specific Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expanding body of evidence suggests that specifically targeting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may potentially benefit both tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there is still a lack of cancer&#8208;targeted molecular tools for in vivo applications. Here, we report the first ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;specific near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensor PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and scavenger PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, targeting the prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD displays a 53&#8208;fold off&#8208;on fluorescence response to H2S at 803 nm with high specificity. PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD can scavenge H2S fast (k2 = 30.8 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 25 oC) without interference from biothiols. Both tools are highly water&#8208;soluble and can be transported into PSMA&#8208;expressing prostate cancer cells selectively. Endogenous H2S levels in murine 22Rv1 tumor models can be imaged and down&#8208;regulated by intravenous injection of PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, respectively. These tools may potentially help investigate H2S cancer biology and related therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zinc(II)&#8208;Palladium(0) Catalytic System for the Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Allylation of N&#8208;unprotected Amino Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported in this work is a synergistic ternary achiral picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;chiral palladium complex system for the highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters. By utilizing a variety of allylic carbonates or vinyl benzoxazinanones as substrates, &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in high yields (up to 96%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Control experiments suggest that the coordination of Zn(II) with the Schiff base intermediate enhances the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds of amino esters, thereby favoring &#945;&#8208;allylation over intrinsic N&#8208;allylation. Furthermore, NMR studies reveal an interaction between the chiral palladium complex and the Zn(II)&#8208;Schiff base intermediate, leading to the formation of a picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;Pd(0) catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high throughput UV&#8208;Vis method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity is disclosed using over 100 compounds of biological and catalytic relevance. A multiple linear regression model enables estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement using &#8764;2&#8197;mg of analyte that was showcased with a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95&#8201;% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives from available starting materials by late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is described. Exquisite selectivity for podophyllotoxin functionalization was demonstrated through arylation, alkenylation and cyclization at C5 position.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of podophyllotoxin derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials through a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is reported here. This strategy uses the ketone and oxime in substrates as directing groups. Four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, thus indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9&#8201;aa, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity, can be prepared by a sequential transformation. In particularly, 9&#8201;aa suppressed HeLa cells with IC50 values of 74.5&#8197;nM, thus providing a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.

Two is better than one: Diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand CageCarbene, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was developed. Studies showed that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4 of Au, Cu or Pd bearing CageCarbene were synthesized and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions.







Abstract
The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for a di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) is reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM undergoes facile deprotonation to in&#8197;situ generate CageCarbene, which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals, such as, Au, Cu or Pd, to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMes and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing a N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much lower catalytic reactivity when it was bound to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd complex. Kinetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Dinuclear Iron(II) Triple Helicates Exhibiting Room Temperature Spin&#8208;Transition Behaviour in Solid and Solution Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three iron(II) dinuclear helicates exhibit incomplete, multistep and single&#8208;step spin transition behaviour close to room temperature in solid, as well as in solution phases. Complexes possess the different crystallographic space groups, which results in different crystallographic packing of the complexes. This, in turn, affects the cooperativity throughout the Fe centre of the crystal lattice, which plays a major role in such spin&#8208;state transition.







Abstract
Herein, three dinuclear iron(II) helicates bearing the molecular formula [Fe2(L1)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (complex 1), [Fe2(L2)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6CH3CN (complex 2), and [Fe2(L3)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5H2O (complex 3) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone. A change in the ligand field strength by terminal modulation led to a change in the spin&#8208;transition behaviour from incomplete, multi&#8208;step to complete, around room temperature in the solid state. Spin transition behaviour has also been observed in the solution phase characterized using variable temperature 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Evans method) and correlated using UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Fitting the NMR data using the ideal solution model yielded the transition temperature in the order T1/2 (1)&lt;T1/2 (2)&lt;T1/2 (3), which indicates an increase in the ligand field strength from complexes 1 to 3. This study accentuates the interplay between the ligand field strength, crystal packing, and supramolecular interactions in fine&#8208;tuning the spin transition behaviour effectively.

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper and silver corroles, symmetrically functionalized with two TCBDs, have been newly synthesized as wideband capturing push&#8208;pull systems. An efficient population of triplet states via the intermediate charge transfer state formed as a function of excitation wavelength is demonstrated using ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy.







Abstract
Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving ethynyl functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift of the spectrum extending it into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical studies coupled with computational studies revealed considerable interactions between the two TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkenes with Acylhydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to access synthetically valuable acylsilanes from alkenes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with acylhydrosilanes is reported. Acylhydrosilanes represent a novel class of acylsilanes and a great variety of acylsilanes can be accessed via this approach. Reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance as well as high atom economy.







Abstract
Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.

The correlation of the properties to the substitution of the diimine ligand and their impact on the photoreactivity of complexes in the presence of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylethylamine are rationalized, overall providing useful structure&#8208;property relationships for copper complexes as photoredox catalysts.







Abstract
A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig's base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.

         <title>Selective Hydroxylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds in Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroids are highly prevalent structures in small molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. These C(sp3)&#8208;rich tetracycles contain many stereocentres, which are important for creating specific vectors and protein binding orientations. Therefore, the ability to hydroxylate steroids with a high degree of regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity is essential for researchers working in this field. This review will cover three main methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8211;H hydroxylation, and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Off&#8208;Cycle and Deactivation Pathways in Radical&#8208;Type Carbene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is an efficient method for C&#8722;C coupling reactions, but also suffers from off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways, such as hydrogen atom transfer and the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes. In this concept article, we demonstrate that off&#8208;cycle species not always lead to a dead&#8208;end and can even unlock new reactivity.







Abstract
Transition metal radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method to generate C&#8722;C bonds, especially to produce fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A significant amount of research has therefore been devoted to applying this methodology, which resulted in innovative routes toward otherwise synthetically challenging products and a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems. Furthermore, combined experimental and theoretical efforts elucidated the reactivity of carbene radical complexes and their off&#8208;cycle pathways. The latter can imply the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes, and undesired hydrogen atom transfer by the carbene radical species from the reaction medium which can lead to catalyst deactivation. In this concept paper, we demonstrate that understanding off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways not only affords solutions to circumvent them, but can also uncover novel reactivity for new applications. In particular, considering off&#8208;cycle species involved in metalloradical catalysis can stimulate further development of radical&#8208;type carbene transfer reactions.

The synthesis and characterization of the compound [Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) is reported. It contains molecular Mn18&#8208;rings which are built from six [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units interconnected by acetate anions. Field and temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements on the compound show weak ferromagnetic interactions between these Mn18&#8208;units in the solid. DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence of the compound in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;subunit within the Mn18&#8208;ring.







Abstract
[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.

         <title>Chiral and Structural Polymorphism of Fibril Architectures of Homologous Lysozymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal approach involving chiroptical spectroscopies (VCD, ECD) and microscopic methods, in particular cryo&#8208;EM, was used to characterize chirality and structure of lysozyme amyloid fibrils. Rich polymorphism was observed for fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes with variations in the secondary structures, protofilament handedness and mesoscopic structures.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils are fascinating and complex structures with the multilayered chiral organization. Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo&#8208;EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in the structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained in&#8197;vitro at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high&#8208;resolution 3D cryo&#8208;EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained in&#8197;vitro in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.

         <title>Photophysical Behavior of Self&#8208;Organizing Derivatives of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;Vertex p&#8208;Carboranes, and their Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and Benzene Analogues</title>

Electronic spectroscopy and DFT analyses demonstrate greater electronic interactions with &#960; substituents for 10&#8208; than 12&#8208;vertex sigma aromatic carborane.







Abstract
Four series of isostructural derivatives of 3&#8208;ring liquid crystalline derivatives containing p&#8208;carboranes (12&#8208;vertex A, and 10&#8208;vertex B), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (C), or benzene (D) as the variable structural element were investigated for their mesogenic behavior and electronic interactions. Comparative studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of elements A&#8211;D in stabilization of the mesophase typically increases in the order: B&lt;A&lt;C&lt;D. Absorption and emission spectroscopy for the four series and reference compounds augmented with DFT computational results revealed that the degree of electronic interactions with the connected benzene &#960; system increases in the order C&lt;A&lt;B&lt;D. Emission spectra exhibit large Stokes&#8217; shifts for 10&#8208;vertex derivatives (B) in solutions and in the solid state. Spectroscopic characterization was supplemented with polarization electronic spectroscopy and solvatochromic studies of selected series. Overall, 12&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane A acts as an electron withdrawing auxochromic substituent with interactions similar to those of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, although capable of accepting some electron density in the excited state. In contrast, 10&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane B is much more interactive with the &#960;&#8208;aromatic electron manifold and exhibits greater ability to participate in photo&#8208;induced CT processes. Absorption and emission energies and quantum yields (1&#8208;51&#8201;%) for carborane derivatives, representing the D&#8722;A&#8722;D system, were compared to those of their isoelectronic zwitterionic analogues (the A&#8722;D&#8722;A system). The analysis is supplemented with four single&#8208;crystal XRD structures.

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>

ScSERF shows distinct effects on the fibril formation of FUS&#8208;Core, FUS&#8208;LC and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. The positively charged N&#8208;terminus of ScSERF competes to bind with the negatively charged C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein accelerating its amyloid fibril formation. The interaction of ScSERF with monomeric FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC inhibits both the primary nucleation formation and later the elongation of fibrils.







Abstract
The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms of SERF acting on different amyloidogenic proteins. Herein, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal them sharing similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while ScSERF inhibits fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC proteins. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.

         <title>Selective Construction of Molecular Borromean Rings and [2]Catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of discrete Cp* Rh&#8208;based structures were constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium (III) bimetallic construction units. This study demonstrates a strategy to convert a binuclear D&#8208;shaped to a [2]catenane by changing the length of bridged ligands. Selective synthesis of [2]catenane and molecular Borromean rings can be achieved under similar conditions.







Abstract
A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures was constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean rings under similar conditions. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Studies on Structural Changes of Modified MWCNTs: Material for Electrochemical Monitoring of Antiviral Drug in Human Serum Samples</title>

Functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) is a potentially selective material for real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum samples with LOD 13.6&#8197;nM.







Abstract
The development of a universal approach for precisely tuning the electrochemical characteristics of conducting carbon nanotubes for tracking harmful agents in the human body with high selectivity and sensitivity remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a simplistic, versatile, and general approach to the construction of functionalized electrochemical material. The design of electrochemical material consists of (i) modification of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with dipodal naphthyl&#8208;based dipodal urea (KR&#8208;1) through non&#8208;covalent functionalization (KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) which enhances the dispersibility of MWCNT and hence conductivity, (ii) complexation of KR&#8208;1@MWCNT with Hg2+ accelerate the electron transfer in the material which amplify the detection response of functionalized material (i.&#8201;e., Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) towards various thymidine analogues. Further, the application of functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum for the first time.

         <title>A New Type of Valence Tautomerism in Cobalt Dioxolene Complexes &#8211; Temperature&#8208;Induced Transition from a Cobalt(III) Catecholate to a Low&#8208;Spin Cobalt(II) Semiquinonate State</title>

A novel twist in temperature&#8208;induced switching of electronic states in cobalt dioxolene complexes: Structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic results demonstrate that valence tautomerism can occur by converting a cobalt(III) catecholate into a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex instead of the usual high&#8208;spin complex.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4tBu2=N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8722;=4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.

         <title>Coexistence of Three Different Spin States in a Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Iron(III) Complex with an Unusual FeIII to Ligand Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trinuclear iron(III) complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 with the innocent ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; exhibits an unusual coexistence of one S=3/2 and two S=1/2 spin states and an uncommon MLCT from FeIII to the ligand LOxN4.







Abstract
We report a trinuclear iron(III) cyanido&#8208;bridged complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 (2[PF6]4) as the oxidation product of binuclear complex [CpMe3(dppe)FeIICN&#8208;FeIII(LN4)][PF6] (1[PF6]) (CpMe3=1, 2, 4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclo&#8208;pentadienyl, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, LN4=pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione&#8208;bis(S&#8208;methylisothiosemicarbazonato). Complex 1[PF6] possesses an intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) which couples antiferromagnetically to the &#960;&#8208;radical ligand (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; and shows a LMCT (ligand to metal charge transfer) transition from (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; to FeIII and the FeII&#8594;FeIII MMCT transition. Upon oxidation of 1[PF6], (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; loses one electron to be the strong electron&#8208;attracting ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; and the intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) becomes a low&#8208;spin six&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=1/2) in 2[PF6]4. Also interestingly, 2[PF6]4 presents the coexistence of three different spin states (one S=3/2 and two S=1/2) and an uncommon FeIII&#8594;(LOxN4)&#8722; MLCT transition, confirmed by the experimental results and supported by the TDDFT calculations.

&lt;sub&gt;N4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the intermediate-spin five-coordinated Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; (S=3/2) becomes a low-spin six-coordinated Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; (S=1/2) in &lt;b&gt;2[PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <dc:description>
Designing a new methodology for the valorization of biomass is of the utmost importance for creating a sustainable future. In this work, we report an efficient hydrosilylation&#8208;based strategy for the selective valorization of biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid and its derivatives into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and even C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective and nontoxic silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we report an efficient hydrosilylation strategy to selectively defunctionalize biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature. All reactions work well in chlorinated solvents but, as a greener alternative, most reactions can be run in toluene or solvent&#8208;less.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocyanation of Ynamides and Photoisomerization, a General and Selective Access to E and Z Trisubstituted &#945;&#8208;Enamidonitriles</title>

Trisubstituted E&#8208;2&#8208;amidoacrylonitriles are produced by direct hydrocyanation of ynamides. Z isomers can be obtained selectively using a thermo&#8208;neutral catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization.







Abstract
The fully regio&#8208; and stereoselective Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of ynamides is reported and represents a general access to various trisubstituted E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles. The catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization selectively yields the energetically comparable Z&#8208;stereoisomer. Finally, the synthetic potential of these new &#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles was evaluated through the synthesis of original heterocycles.

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored detergents. Guidelines are introduced based on the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was established by Griffin in 1949, to enable the directed structural optimization of detergents for the in&#8197;vitro investigation of membrane protein&#8208;lipid interactions.







Abstract
Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfing on the pentafulvene: The reaction of elemental magnesium and a pentafulvene indicates the formation of a magnesium pentafulvene complex as an intermediate, in a coordination mode that is only known for early transition metals. This species is interceptable in one&#8208;pot reactions with secondary amines to yield unprecedented magnesium amide half sandwich complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp'Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Confined NiCo Alloy Hollow Spheres as an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo@NC HS electrocatalyst with hollow structure have been constructed as a cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries. The synergistic effect in NiCo@NC HS can promote the activation of O2* and OH* intermediates by modulating the electronic structure, and resulting enhanced OER/ORR activities.







Abstract

The synergistic effect in NiCo@NC HS can promote the activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* and OH* intermediates by modulating the electronic structure, and resulting enhanced OER/ORR activities.

         <title>Extending the Palette of Green Coumarin Photocages &#8211; Oligonucleotide Fragmentation and Superior 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>

In this article, the green&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing DCCM photocage was modified to not just allow oligonucleotide release (OFF&#8594;ON) but also oligonucleotide fragmentation and thereby serve an additional regulation pathway (ON&#8594;OFF) that gives more freedom in gene regulation. Furthermore, the uncaging efficiency of DCCM by rigidification of the coumarin core was improved, resulting in an additional 20&#8197;nm red&#8208;shift.







Abstract
The possibilities of dicyanocoumarin (DCCM)&#8208;modified oligonucleotides are expanded to not just allow their release and therefore activation with green light (OFF&#8594;ON) but to also now offer a solution for their fragmentation after exposure to green light (ON&#8594;OFF). Furthermore, an answer to the decreasing uncaging quantum yields often faced when working with red&#8208;shifted photocages is given and showed that rigidified DCCM 5&#8217;&#8208;caps outperform their predecessors. Those two new 5&#8217;&#8208;caps with ATTO 390 motif or julolidine core are compatible with copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions (CuAACs) and therefore suitable for efficient caging through cyclization or more bioconjugation reactions. Due to their planarization, they even experience an additional red&#8208;shift which is important for their use in biological applications.

Programmable DNA assembly: Here we have rationally re&#8208;engineered DNA tiles that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures and can be orthogonally deactivated/re&#8208;activated with redox&#8208;controlled DNA fuel strands. By controlling the relative rate of re&#8208;assembly of each tile, we can regulate the tiles distribution in the final co&#8208;polymer. The approach can be coupled with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation reactions and responds to external stimuli (i.&#8201;e., pH) providing an additional level of control in the reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a strategy that allows the programmable and autonomous reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA polymers using redox chemistry. We have rationally designed different DNA monomers (tiles) that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures. The tiles can be orthogonally activated/deactivated with disulfide&#8208;linked DNA fuel strands that are degraded over time upon reduction because of the presence of a reducing agent in the system. The concentration of the disulfide fuels determines the activation kinetics of each DNA tile, which controls the degree of order/disorder in the formed co&#8208;polymer. The disulfide&#8208;reduction pathway can be employed together with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation pathways providing an additional level of control in the re&#8208;organization of DNA structures. Taking advantage of the different pH&#8208;sensitivities of disulfide&#8208;thiol and enzymatic reactions, we show that we can control the order in DNA&#8208;based co&#8208;polymers as a function of pH.

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relationships between prompt fluorescence, room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence are established in a series of dimers of phenothiazine and its chemically oxidized congener phenothiazine&#8208;5.5&#8208;dioxide. This provides detailed insights into the interplay between the singlet and triplet manifolds of these heterocycles and emphasizes the complex functional electronic structure of phenothiazines.







Abstract
Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZ(SO2)) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZ(SO2) dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZ(SO2) dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MPIase, a glycolipid, is involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. In this study, we synthesized analogs to reveal the structural requirements and glycan&#8208;length dependency for the integration and chaperone&#8208;like activity, and synergistic effects with the membrane chaperone, YidC. The structure&#8208;activity relationship study verified the mechanism for translocon&#8208;independent integration aided by MPIase.







Abstract
MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.

         <title>Quest of Quadruple Bonding Between Two Main&#8208;Group Atoms in AeB&#8722; and AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) and the Role of d Orbitals of Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Atoms in Covalent Interactions</title>

The chemical bonds in the electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state of the alkaline earth boride anions AeB&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) have four strongly polarized bonding orbitals, namely two doubly occupied &#963; orbitals HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 and a pair of singly occupied degenerate &#960; orbitals SOMO and SOMO&#8217; with sd hybridized atomic orbitals of the atoms Ae.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(6,8)/def2&#8208;QZVPP and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPP levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeB&#8722; and isoelectronic AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The boride anions AeB&#8722; have an electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state. The quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is 5.8&#8211;12.3&#8197;kcal/mol higher in energy and the singlet (1&#916;) state is 13.1&#8211;15.3&#8197;kcal/mol above the triplet. The isoelectronic AeC molecules are also predicted to have a low&#8208;lying triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state but the quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is only 2.2&#8197;kcal/mol (SrC) and 2.9&#8197;kcal/mol (CaC) above the triplet state. The triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) and quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) states of BaC are nearly isoenergetic. All systems have rather strong bonds. The calculated bond dissociation energies of the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state are between De=38.3&#8211;41.7&#8197;kcal/mol for AeB&#8722; and De=49.4&#8211;57.5&#8197;kcal/mol for AeC. The barium species have always the strongest bonds whereas the calcium and strontium compounds have similar BDEs. The bonding analysis indicates that there is little charge migration in AeB&#8722; in the direction Ae&#8594;B&#8722; where the alkaline earth atoms carry positive charges between 0.09&#8197;e&#8211;0.22&#8197;e. The positive charges at the Ae atoms are much larger in AeC where the charge migration Ae&#8594;C is between 0.90&#8197;e&#8211;0.91&#8197;e. A detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions with the EDA&#8208;NOCV method shows that all diatomic species AeB&#8722; and AeC are built from dative interactions between Ae (1S, ns2) and B&#8722; or C (3P, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;1). The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae+ (2S, ns1)+C&#8722; (4S, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;12p&#963;1). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n&#8208;1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds. This creates a second energetically low&#8208;lying &#963;&#8208;bonding MO in the molecules, which feature valence orbitals with the order &#981;1 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;2 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;3 (degenerate &#960;&#8208;bonding). All four occupied valence MOs of AeB&#8722; and AeC are bonding orbitals. Since the degenerate &#960; orbitals &#981;3 are only singly occupied, the formal bond order is three.

         <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Directed Two&#8208;Level Hierarchical Growth of Lanthanide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanoarchitectures</title>

The on&#8208;surface synthesis process of a metal&#8208;organic supramolecular structure based on hierarchical growth driven by Dy atoms is shown in this work. Modifying the stoichiometry, it is possible to tune the size of the tecton unit in a controlled manner.







Abstract
The design of a well&#8208;ordered arrangement of atoms on a solid surface has long been sought due to the envisioned applications in many different fields. On&#8208;surface synthesis of metal&#8208;organic networks is one of the most promising fabrication techniques. Hierarchical growth, which involves coordinative schemes with weaker interactions, favours the formation of extended areas with the desired complex structure. However, the control of such hierarchical growth is in its infancy, particularly for lanthanide&#8208;based architectures. Here the hierarchical growth of a Dy&#8208;based supramolecular nanoarchitecture on Au(111) is described. Such an assembly is based on a first hierarchical level of metallo&#8208;supramolecular motifs, which in a second level of hierarchy self&#8208;assemble through directional hydrogen bonds, giving rise to a periodic two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular porous network. Notably, the size of the metal&#8208;organic based tecton of the first level of hierarchy can be tailored by modifying the metal&#8208;ligand stoichiometric ratio.

Computational modelling of the interaction between antibody and hapten predict ternary complex formation by hapten&#8208;based chimeric antibody recruiting molecules.







Abstract
Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) are an innovative class of chimeric molecules, consisting of an antibody&#8208;binding ligand (ABL) and a target&#8208;binding ligand (TBL). ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody&#8208;bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti&#8208;hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti&#8208;hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM&#8208;antibody complex and ARM&#8208;mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces in&#8197;vitro confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation on a Base&#8208;stabilized Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene towards N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and H&#8722;E (E=Si, P, B) bonds was studied. Reactions of the P(I) species with unsaturated compounds, such as tetrachlorobenzaquinone, benzaldehyde and phenylisocyanate, was also investigated.







Abstract
Reduction of (NP)PCl2 (NP=phosphinoamidinate [PhC(NAr)(=NPPri2)]&#8722;) with KC8 affords the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P (9). Reaction of 9 with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MeC(NMe))2C: results in the NHC&#8208;adduct NHC&#8594;P&#8722;P(Pri2)=NC(Ph)=NAr featuring an iminophosphinyl group. Reactions of 9 with HBpin and H3SiPh led to the metathesis products (NP)Bpin and (NP)SiH2Ph, respectively, whereas with HPPh2 a base&#8208;stabilized phosphido&#8208;phosphinidene, the product of N&#8722;P and H&#8722;P bond metathesis, was obtained. Reaction of 9 with tetrachlorobenzaquinone results in oxidation of P(I) to P(III), accompanied by oxidation of the amidophosphine ligand into P(V). Addition of benzaldehyde to 9 results in a phospha&#8208;Wittig reaction affording a product of P=P and C=O bond metathesis. Related reaction with phenylisocyanate results in a product of N&#8722;P(=O)Pri2 addition to the C=N bond of an intermediate iminophosphaalkene to produce a phosphinidene intramolecularly stabilized by a diaminocarbene.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>

Mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids were prepared by using PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP as a template by mediated the hydrogen bonding interaction through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block. The highly ordered structures reveal the high surface area and high pore volume that could be used in supercapacitor application.







Abstract
Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30&#8197;wt.% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180&#8201;&#176;C, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.

         <title>Substituent and Solvent Effect Studies of N&#8208;Alkenylnitrone 4&#960; Electrocyclizations
</title>

Making the unreactive reactive: Substituent and solvent effects for the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to azetidine nitrones have been investigated by using Hammett, Eyring, and isotope effect studies. The results of these investigations have been used to prepare previously inaccessible azetidine nitrones, identify catalysts, and establish a fundamental understanding for synthetic applications.







Abstract
The roles of substituent and solvent effects in promoting the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to give azetidine nitrones have been investigated by experimental examination of relative rates, activation energies, and linear free energy relationships. These transformations are synthetically important because they favor the formation of a strained heterocyclic ring with imbedded functionality and stereochemical information for versatile derivatization. Mechanistic investigations, including Hammett studies, solvent&#8208;dependent Eyring studies, and solvent isotope effects, provide insight into the steric and electronic factors that control these electrocyclizations and identify trends that can be used to advance this approach towards the rapid synthesis of complex azetidines.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active cobalt catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;heterocycles was identified. The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N&#8208;doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.







Abstract
Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.

Electrochemical difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes were realized utilizing commercially available organofluorine reagents through scission of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds via 1,2&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;migration process, leading to di and mono&#8208;fluoroalkyl functionalized ketone compounds with good functional group tolerance. This transformation tolerates a diverse set of migrating groups, involving (hetero)arenes, olefins, and alkynes.







Abstract
An electrochemical strategy for the dual functionalizations of unactivated alkenes through an intramolecular migration process was realized in the absence of sacrificial chemical oxidants and noble&#8208;metal catalysts under mild reaction conditions. The electrochemistry enabled a (hetero)aryl migration while providing access to alkenyl/alkynyl&#8208;migration products. Thus, electricity was employed for the formation of functionalized fluoroalkyl radicals through activation of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds from fluorinated esters. Thereby, we obtained a variety of di and mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl products with good functional group tolerance as well as chemo, and regioselectivities. Likewise, defluorinative allylation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl alkyl bromides proved viable. The reaction mechanism was established by experiments and computations.

A robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of either 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkage is disclosed, employing same donors (glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates) and single promoter (TMSNTf2) in different solvents (CH2Cl2/nitrile vs. CH2Cl2/THF), which enables the efficient synthesis of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans, an unprecedented hybrid of amylose and cellulose.







Abstract
Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.

         <title>&#8220;Catch&#8208;Store&#8208;Release&#8221; Strategy for the Stabilization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDI)</title>

Catch&#8208;store&#8208;release: The industrially crucial, but thermally unstable, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) can be stabilized in the solid state by the formation of imidazolium&#8722;amidate linkages, and restored quantitatively by the application of CuI salts.







Abstract
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is an industrially crucial compound, being one of the most utilized linkers in the polyurethane industry. However, its long&#8208;term stability is limited due to dimerization to form insoluble uretdione. Herein we demonstrate an organometallic &#8220;catch&#8208;store&#8208;release&#8221; concept aiming at improving the long&#8208;term chemical stability of MDI. Treatment of MDI with two equivalents of selected N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) forms stable MDI&#8722;NHC adducts. Treatment of the adducts with CuCl forms metastable di&#8208;CuI complexes that undergo decomposition to re&#8208;form MDI (up to 85&#8201;%), along with Cu&#8722;NHC complexes. The yield of re&#8208;formed MDI can be improved (up to 95&#8201;%) by the release of the NHC ligands in the form of thiourea; this prevents subsequent MDI dimerization/polymerization by the carbenes. Furthermore, the need to separate MDI from the reaction mixture can be eliminated by the direct reaction of MDI&#8722;NHC complexes with alcohols (as models for diols), that form dicarbamate (as a model for polyurethane) quantitatively.

By the Bi: The bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+, stabilized by an [SbF6]&#8722; counteranion, has been synthesized, isolated and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). A detailed comparison with [BiMe2(SbF6)] highlights the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity. Differences in their Lewis acidity have been rationalized, and their reactivity towards [PF6]&#8722; as well as Lewis pair formations have been studied.







Abstract
The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF6]&#8722; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.

Like clockwork, the interconnected gears of substituent and solvent effects drive the conrotatory 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones towards the formation of azetidine nitrones. These parameters can then be tuned to facilitate the electrocyclization of challenging substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;L. Anderson and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300551). Picture by Laura Alonso.

Bi Lewis acidic: Donor&#8208;free cationic bismuth compounds readily coordinate Lewis basic substrates including arenes, phosphanes, and isonitriles, and degrade the weakly coordinating counter&#8208;anion [PF6]&#8211;. Counterintuitively, an increase in steric bulk around bismuth can increase the Lewis acidity. In the graphic, a bismuth kraken grabs Lewis basic substrates, solving scientific puzzles about bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. von&#8197;H&#228;nisch, C. Lichtenberg and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204012).

4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI) is a key diisocyanate linker in the production of polyurethanes. 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI is thermally unstable, undergoing dimerization to unreactive and insoluble uretdione. The &#8220;catch&#8211;store&#8211;release&#8221; strategy presented in the Research Article by S. Groysman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300924) allows 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI to be stabilized in the form of an imidazolium amidate that is produced by the coordination of two equivalents of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. The complex can be released by heating with CuCl (with or without sulfur); this forms a CuI carbene/urea complex and restores MDI. Artwork by the authors with help from Mary Iverson.

In this review, the configuration&#8208;dependent molecular recognition, aggregation&#8208;induced emission and bioactivities of cis/trans tetraphenylethene&#8208;based isomers are summarized. Facilitated by the unique properties, their applications in fluorescence detection, bioimaging and targeted therapy are discussed.







Abstract
Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.

         <title>The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 30, May 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have evoked much attention in gas storage and separation. In this review, recent advances in the adsorptive separation of ethylene from C2 hydrocarbons by metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized from the aspects of removing C2H2 from the C2H4, obtaining C2H4 from C2H4 and C2H6 mixtures, and separation of multi&#8208;component mixtures, respectively. In addition, some perceptions toward their development and challenge are introduced.







Abstract
Separating ethylene (C2H4) from the C2 hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high&#8208;purity C2H4 as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons typically entails high&#8208;energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low&#8208;energy separation technologies that manufacture high&#8208;purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons.

     alt="The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal-Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&lt;/b&gt; have evoked much attention in gas storage and separation. In this review, recent advances in the adsorptive separation of ethylene from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons by metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized from the aspects of removing C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, obtaining C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures, and separation of multi-component mixtures, respectively. In addition, some perceptions toward their development and challenge are introduced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons typically entails high-energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low-energy separation technologies that manufacture high-purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of l&#8208;Methionine Analogues and Application in a Methyltransferase Catalysed Alkylation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of small molecules is a key step for the development of pharmaceuticals. S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues are used by methyltransferases (MTs) to transfer alkyl, allyl and benzyl moieties chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectively onto substrates, enabling an enzymatic way for specific derivatisation of a wide range of molecules. l&#8208;Methionine analogues are required for the synthesis of SAM analogues. Most of these are not commercially available. In nature, O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolases (OAHS) catalyse the synthesis of l&#8208;methionine from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine or l&#8208;homocysteine, and methyl mercaptan. Here, we investigated the substrate scope of ScOAHS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and organic thiols. The promiscuous enzyme was used to synthesise nine different l&#8208;methionine analogues with modifications on the thioether residue up to a conversion of 75%. ScOAHS was combined with an established MT dependent three&#8208;enzyme alkylation cascade, allowing transfer of in total seven moieties onto two MT substrates. Ethylation was nearly doubled with the new four&#8208;enzyme cascade, indicating a beneficial effect of the in situ production of l&#8208;methionine analogues with ScOAHS.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. We revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, where even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydration rearrangement in the 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8211;(H2O)2 cluster induced by photoionization: The effect of solvent&#8208;solvent interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8211;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8208;H bonds are singly hydrated</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceutical engineering, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews that have discussed peripheral editing (i.e., C&#8211;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editing via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations has so far been less discussed. In this review, we tried to summarize and depict the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions on heteroarenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and the potential application of this transformation for the synthesis of natural products. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies have also been highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Thin Layer Chromatography&#8208;Freeze Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: A Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising tool used in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain direct molecular information on the spots. However, the stationary phase and impurities on nanoparticles used in SERS can negatively affect the efficacy of the TLC&#8208;SERS. The present study shows that freezing improves TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency, allowing for the identification of compounds with high sensitivity and the monitoring of synthetic reactions quantitatively.







Abstract
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification as it primarily relies on retention factors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surface&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&lt;/b&gt; is a promising tool used in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain direct molecular information on the spots. However, the stationary phase and impurities on nanoparticles used in SERS can negatively affect the efficacy of the TLC-SERS. The present study shows that freezing improves TLC-SERS efficiency, allowing for the identification of compounds with high sensitivity and the monitoring of synthetic reactions quantitatively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification as it primarily relies on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is an appropriate choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC-SERS efficiency. It was found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC-SERS. In this study, TLC-freeze SERS is applied to the monitoring of four chemically important reactions. The proposed method can identify the product and side-products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 2&#8208;Anilidomethylpyridine Ligand Framework Showcasing Hydride Storage and Transfer Abilities in Its Aluminum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework, a proven ancillary support, undergoes 1,4&#8208;hydroalumination by AlH3(NMe2Et) and models the hydride storage in Hantzsch esters and biological cofactors like NADH or NAD(P)H. DFT analyses suggest a &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; hydroalumination mechanism that underlines alane's acid&#8208;base duality. AlMe3 in contrast does not lead to such pyridyl dearomatization.







Abstract
Dearomatized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand's pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (NNLH) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4&#8208;hydroaluminated by AlH3(NMe2Et) to [(NNLde)AlH(NMe2Et)] (1; NNLde=hydride&#8208;inserted dearomatized version of NNL). A hydride abstraction by B(C6F5)3 rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(NNL)AlH(NMe2Et)][HB(C6F5)3] (6). Notably, such chemical non&#8208;innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(NNL)AlH2] (2) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation. The results advocate an intriguing &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; pathway, which underlines alane's Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base duality. NMe2Et carrying the alane also plays a crucial role. In contrast, the chemistry between NNLH and AlMe3 is much different, giving only [(NNL)AlMe2] (4) from the adduct [(NNLH)AlMe3] (3) by deprotonation but not a subsequent pyridyl dearomatization in the presence or absence of NMe2Et. This divergence is also justified by DFT analyses.

A heterogeneous flow Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has been carried out. A water or aqueous organic solution of aryl halides and arylboronic acids (left&#8208;hand side) was continuously injected into a flow column cartridge filled with convoluted polymeric Pd catalysts and stabilizing polymeric auxiliary materials (orange balls) along with sea sand (white balls). The products, which included liquid crystals, pharmaceutical compounds, and organic LED compounds, were eluted from the column (right&#8208;hand side).

         <title>Peptide Stapling with Boronate Esters&#8208; A Reversible Folding of (Artificial) Peptide Chain to &#945;&#8208;Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely designed peptide sequences decorated with phenylboronic acid derivative and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid) in appropriate positions show reversibly forming ester residue and switching between cyclic (closed, stapled) and linear (open, non&#8208;stapled) forms. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain.







Abstract
Stabilization of a peptide conformation via stapling strategy may be realized by the reversible or more often irreversible connection of side chains being in mutually appropriate geometry. An incorporation of phenylboronic acid and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid), attached to two lysine side chains via amide bonds and separated by 2, 3, or 6 other residues in the C&#8208;terminal fragment of RNase A introduces the intramolecular interaction stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;helical organization. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain. We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Ene Click Reaction of Electron&#8208;Deficient &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules with Negative Activation Enthalpies</title>

         <dc:description>
Amino&#8208;ene click reaction of an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with an amine that proceeds faster at lower temperatures in some solvents. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction would open up a new versatile platform for amino&#8208;functionalization of brittle or unstable &#960;&#8208;systems under mild conditions.







Abstract
An amino&#8208;ene click reaction is a type of aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8722;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein, an unconventional amino&#8208;ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, in which an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, such as a naphthalenediimide, reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures is reported. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeds via a pre&#8208;equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;&#8208;core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, it was demonstrated that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273&#8197;K than at 347&#8197;K, which was easily observed visually.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From substrates to products. Just as boats make crossing from one side of a river to the other possible, a suitable catalytic system allows access to difficult or unattainable transformations. An unprecedented reductive boration of amides is achieved through a triple iridium&#8211;photoredox&#8211;organocatalysis system, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products. More information can be found in the Research Article by X. Wang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301199).

         <title>A Transparent, Healable and Recyclable Alicyclic Poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) Multiblock Copolymer with Ultrahigh Toughness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of healable alicyclic poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymers (PEBA&#8208;I539, PEBA&#8208;I875, and PEBA&#8208;I1212), consisting of an asymmetric diamine (IPDA) with substantial steric hindrance, were successfully synthesized, and PEBA&#8208;I1212 with record&#8208;high strength and toughness for self&#8208;healing polyamide&#8208;based elastomers exhibited great prospects as a protective coating and flexible substrate for soft electronics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing polyamide multiblock copolymer with robust mechanical properties is highly desired. Here, an alicyclic diamine monomer, isophoronediamine (IPDA), with asymmetric structure and substantial steric hindrance was incorporated into the backbone of poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymer. Based on the phase&#8208;lock effect, the mechanical properties and segmental mobility of copolymers can be modulated on a large scale via adjusting the molecular weight of hard segments. An extraordinary tensile strength of 32.0&#8197;MPa and an excellent elongation at break of 1881&#8201;% were simultaneously achieved, which leaded to a record&#8208;high toughness of 328.9&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 for self&#8208;healable polyamide elastomers. The synergism between the dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks and the diffusion of polymer chains contributed to a balance between the mechanical performance and self&#8208;healing efficiency of copolymers. Due to the adjustable mechanical performance, rapid scratch self&#8208;healing ability and superior impact resistance, the resultant copolymers showed great potential in the fields of protective coatings and soft electronics.

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines by a Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Oxidative Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an efficient and green procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with tryptamines is reported. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of the iPrPNP&#8722;Mn catalyst and a weak base (Na2CO3). This method tolerated a variety of benzylic and aliphatic alcohol substrates with different functional groups and afforded diverse products in good to excellent isolated yields using tryptamines. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesised pharmaceutical molecules harman, harmaline, and harmine in a concise manner.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unleashing the power of peptide hydrogels for environmental remediation: This is a tale of an ultrashort peptide hydrogel (azo&#8208;KC) and its efficiency for wastewater treatment. The hydrogel is the outcome of the cumulative efforts of covalent and noncovalent interactions providing unique features like thixotropy and insolubility in bulk water medium. Dye contamination from textile industries is a severe concern for water pollution, and this crosslinked 3D fibrous hydrogel has been implemented as a promising way to efficiently address such wastewater challenges. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Ahmed, B. Pramanik and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300312). Various elements in this picture were designed by Freepik.

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen is generated by the BODIPY photosensitizer, whose X&#8208;ray structure is shown in the central part of the picture. The structures in the left and right corners of the doors are those of bis(benzothienylo)[1,4]thiaborins&#8212;basic building blocks of BODIPY. The sensitization process requires white light, which is symbolized by a light bulb. Triplet oxygen enters through the red door, where it is excited to the singlet state, and leaves through the blue door. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;H. Marek&#8208;Urban, K. Durka, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300680). Artwork by P.H.M.&#8208;U.

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence SwitchingStrategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217;risk of metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the structural ambiguity of actinide(IV) oxalate sheet structures: a case for alternate coordination geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plutonium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Pu(C2O4)2&#8729;6H2O; PuOx) is an important intermediate in the recovery of plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Its formation via precipitation is well studied, yet its crystal structure remains unknown. Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)&#173;2&#8729;6H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)&#173;2&#8729;6H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2&#183;6H2O (ThOx). This data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, has resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we identify the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. This work exemplifies&#160;the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin &#8211; a Critical Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a wildly used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexacationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic peripheral substituents, on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated Mg(I)&#8211;Mg(I)&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups loses to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two Mg(II) centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8211;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety that bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R = Cy; 7, R = iPr) and [L&#8226;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8226;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, by reaction of 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing a diacetylide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Swing Rates in Macrocyclic Molecular Mortise Hinges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise&#8208;type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The data is consistent with dynamic hinging from a folded&#8208;to&#8208;extended&#8208;to&#8208;folded enantiomeric states. Crystallographic and solution structures of the folded states are reported. Chemical shift predictions derived from crystallographic data corroborate fully revolute hinge motion. The rate of hinging is affected by steric congestion at the hinge axis.&#160; Macrocycles containing glycine, 1, hinge faster than those comprising aminoisobutyric acid, 2. The free energies of activation, &#916;G&#8225;, for 1 and 2 were determined to be 13.3&#160; &#177;&#160; 0.3 kcal/mol and 16.3 &#177; 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively. This barrier is largely independent of solvent across those surveyed (CD3OD, CD3CN, DMSO&#8208;d6, pyridine&#8208;d5, D2O). Experiment and computation predict energy barriers that are consistent with disruption of an intramolecular network of hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations reveal pathways for hinge motion.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation and hydrolysis has been developed. Owing to entropic factors, a macrocyclic triboronic acid and tricyclic boroxine can be dynamically interconverted by simple heating/cooling. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability against hydrolysis.







Abstract
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked by covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied by changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved by simple heating/cooling, whereas no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected by linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.

Abstract
A class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this Review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based dissipation system with synchronized multiple molecular fuels provides multiple transient states and enhanced complexity. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels.







Abstract
Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system is demonstrated that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule extends the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. It is envisioned that the system will find broad application in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;Arylation of Backbone Amides as a Novel Tool for Conformational Modification in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an inquisitive approach, cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;aryl alanine amino acids were synthesized. Their conformations in solution were determined by NMR spectroscopy and compared with those of other N&#8208;modified peptides. The compounds showed relatively high conformational homogeneity and populated well&#8208;characterized antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures having discrete &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;turns and hydrogen bonding patterns; these have been classified into different templates.







Abstract
A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. NMR&#8208;based conformation studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides revealed five distinct template conformations with an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure; for N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides three template structures were revealed. All the template structures have distinct peptide&#8208;turn features. The conformations in these N&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogues. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides exhibit a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations differ significantly from those in N&#8208;methyl analogues. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for application as a novel tool for conformation and physicochemical modification in peptides.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation leads to the formation of a persistent 3D 9&#8208;borafluorene radical that exhibits remarkable stability in both solid and solution states. Single crystal structure, EPR analysis, and theoretical studies indicate that the unpaired electron is predominantly located on boron.







Abstract
In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical. The radical was fully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 9&#8208;borafluorene radical was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.

         <title>Organic Afterglow Nanoparticles in Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic afterglow nanoparticles are unique optical materials that emit light long after cessation of excitation. Due to their advantages of no need for real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration, and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis, and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level. In this review, we summarize and illustrate the recent progress of organic afterglow imaging, focusing on the mechanism of organic afterglow materials and their biological application. Furthermore, we also discuss the potential challenges and the further directions of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Direction Switching and Self&#8208;recovering Mechanochromic Luminescence of Anthracene&#8208;modified o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene 1 and found that its crystal polymorph 1a show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in solid. Initially, we observed the bathchromic MCL behavior from 1a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bisubstrate Analogues for RNA Methylation Studies using two Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a SAM analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the a&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, an iCuAAC reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling&#160; to connect the a&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the a&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of substituted derivatives of a tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;Ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#160;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8211;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed Inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8208;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.</dc:description>

However, when the UiO-66-(NH-SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post-modification with sulfo-acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra-high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub-nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane to the high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable chemicals is of great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8208;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, the single transition metal atoms (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8208;O active site is the rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48 eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offer excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under a mild condition with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is important. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. A TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol successfully combine these items and stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7:1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO is thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8208;50oC and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Self&#8208;Assembly Driven by Sodium Trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus is not only an essential element for life but also an important activation component for multiple types of prebiotics on early Earth. Synergistic symbiosis between N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;type membrane precursor and peptide can be realized via sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m) activation effect based on the different activation mechanisms, which plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells.







Abstract
The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. However, more research is required on both processes, particularly on the interaction between prebiotic simple fatty&#8208;acid membranes and peptide synthesis. In this study, the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of phenylalanine (Phe) in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system was systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA). Decanoic acid was activated by P3m to form a mixed anhydride, which then reacted with an amino acid to form the amide NAA. As a kind of membrane&#8208;forming amphiphile, NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. Moreover, 11 other representative amino acids, namely alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), and arginine (Arg), were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. The abovementioned mechanism involving P3m&#8208;activated carboxylic acid has not been reported in the literature. Our experimental results indicate that the participation of decanoic acid in the P3m activation&#8208;based peptide formation reaction system plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells. The P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.

         <title>Reactivity of a Strictly T&#8208;Shaped Phosphine Ligated by an Acridane Derived NNN Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine derived from an NNN acridane pincer ligand is reported. Phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is observed, and the activation of hydridic and protic E&#8722;H bonds is demonstrated, including complete disassembly of water.







Abstract
The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8722;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.

         <title>Investigations into Simplified Analogues of the Herbicidal Natural Product (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Cornexistin has long been of interest to the crop protection community due to its interesting herbicidal profile and unique mode of action. However, the complex chemical structure of cornexistin has hindered further research into new analogues. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure, we investigated simplified analogues of cornexistin that focused on the effects that the functional groups located on the right&#8208;hand side of the 9&#8208;membered ring have on herbicidal efficacy and target affinity.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to transketolase from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(+)-Cornexistin has long been of interest&lt;/b&gt; to the crop protection community due to its interesting herbicidal profile and unique mode of action. However, the complex chemical structure of cornexistin has hindered further research into new analogues. Guided by an X-Ray co-crystal structure, we investigated simplified analogues of cornexistin that focused on the effects that the functional groups located on the right-hand side of the 9-membered ring have on herbicidal efficacy and target affinity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)-cornexistin. Guided by an X-Ray co-crystal structure of cornexistin bound to transketolase from &lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine-membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleavage fluorogenic DNAzyme has been made for recognizing diverse strains of Clostridium difficile that frequently cause an infectious disease known as C.&#8197;difficile infection (CDI). Upon encountering C.&#8197;difficile cells, this DNAzyme cuts itself to produce a fluorescent signal, thus making it useful as a molecular probe for CDI diagnosis. This DNAzyme is highly specific as it stays silent in the presence of several control bacterial cells. The DNAzyme has an intriguing secondary structure with a pseudoknot arrangement that is essential for its functionality. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300240).

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provides a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion&#8208;binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+ &gt; Cl&#8254;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.</dc:description>

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S hinge.

         <title>The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex: enabling metal ion stability and selectivity via backbone helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, up to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduced or demethylated variants of a C(13)&#8208;desmethylene congener of the marine microtubule stabilizer (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide have been prepared by HWE&#8208;based macrocyclization and stereoselective construction of the hemiaminal center in the side chain. While all modifications led to reduced growth inhibitory activity, the 2,3&#8208;dihydro and the C(17)&#8208;desmethyl variants retained potent antiproliferative activity with single&#8208;digit to low&#8208;double&#8208;digit nanomolar IC50 values against several cancer cell lines.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biochemical and cellular profiling of five partially reduced or demethylated analogs of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (ZMP). These analogs were derived from 13&#8208;desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (DM&#8208;ZMP), which is an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as ZMP. Key steps in the synthesis of all compounds were the formation of the dioxabicyclo[15.3.1]heneicosane core by an intramolecular HWE reaction (67&#8211;95&#8201;% yield) and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction with an (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived sorbamide transfer complex, to establish the C(20) stereocenter (24&#8211;71&#8201;% yield). As the sole exception, for the 5&#8208;desmethyl macrocycle, ring&#8208;closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclization product into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful. All modifications led to reduced cellular activity and lowered microtubule&#8208;binding affinity compared to DM&#8208;ZMP, albeit to a different extent. For compounds incorporating the reactive enone moiety of ZMP, IC50 values for cancer cell growth inhibition varied between 5 and 133&#8197;nM, compared to 1&#8211;12&#8197;nM for DM&#8208;ZMP. Reduction of the enone double bond led to a several hundred&#8208;fold loss in growth inhibition. The cellular potency of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;13&#8208;desmethylene zampanolide, as the most potent analog identified, remained within a ninefold range of that of DM&#8208;ZMP.

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;dye stereoisomers, and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer were prepared. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals the spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals precise exo&#8208;configuration and dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. A chiral dye solid displayed circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence due to the chiral transfer from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore.







Abstract
New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8211;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.&#8201;e., circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (~200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan.&#160; To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay we show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal b&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N-acetyl-&#945;-galactosaminidase (&#945;-NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;-N-acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non-carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 nM) and &#945;-NAGAL selective (~200-fold) guanidino-containing derivative DGJNGuan.&#160; To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image-based method to measure levels of the Tn-antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a-NAGAL. Using this assay we show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a-NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal b-hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off-target inhibition both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;-NAGAL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in Origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219 &#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8208;1.47 g cm&#8208;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of polymeric ligand grafting region on confined assembly of gold nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8208;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8208;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8208;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8208;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8208;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochromism: A modular access to 16 intensely colored, redox&#8208;active heterophenoquinones is presented. Structure to property relationships are identified. This material class is promising as cathodically decoloring electrochromes with well&#8208;defined structures and redox states.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure&#8208;property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in&#8197;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in color upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in for example tintable glass.

A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (L)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized.

Abstract
In this study, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (l)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized. Gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives were performed to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates by self&#8208;molecular recognition.

         <title>De&#8208;Risking S&#8208;F Bond Formation: A Gas Cylinder&#8208;Free Strategy to Access S(IV) and S(VI) Fluorinated Compounds
</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein we report the oxidative halogenation of thiols via the ex situ generation of chlorine by employing calcium hypochorite as solid bench&#8208;stable precursor. This approach enables the synthesis of three distinct classes of compounds (R&#8208;SF3, RSO2F and RSF4Cl). Metastable R&#8208;SF4Cl intermediates are further postfunctionalized to access structures of higher complexity, and computational analysis elucidate potential pathways that leads to cis&#8208;selectivity for certain heteroaromatic SF4Cl structures.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8722;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8722;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8208;F or S(VI)&#8208;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;functionalizations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Synergetic Response of Magnetism, Dielectricity and Luminescence Based on (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4</title>

         <dc:description>
A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid phase transition (OIHPT) material, (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 shows magnetic, dielectric and luminescence synergetic response at near room temperature.







Abstract
Multifunctional materials with working temperatures near room temperature are crucial for practical applications. Until now, it is still a great challenge to obtain such materials. In this paper, a complex of (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 (1) with a structural phase transition near room temperature is reported. The phase transition induces switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and luminescent response over the same range of temperatures. It is the first time the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and luminescence near room temperature have been observed in the same molecular complex.

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo dye is one of the most iconic compounds connecting chemistry to our society. In addition to providing the characteristic blue color, indigos display fascinating photochemical properties. This Review first discusses the synthetic construction and derivatization of indigos. Then their photoswitching and photoinduced electron transfer behaviors are described to showcase the utility of indigos as photoresponsive molecular tools.







Abstract
Indigo, one of the most ancient and abundant dyes in human history, has recently emerged as a potential functional motif due to its intriguing photochemical properties. This review aims to provide insights into both the preparation of these molecules and their utilization in molecular systems. First, the synthesis of the indigo core as well as available methods to derivatize indigo are described to outline synthetic strategies to build the desired molecular structures. Then, the photochemical behavior of indigos is discussed, with particular focus on E&#8208;Z photoisomerization and photoinduced electron transfer. Connections between the molecular structures and their photochemical properties are highlighted and serve as guiding principles for designing indigos to be applied as photoresponsive tools.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Vacancies on VO2 Multilayered Structures for Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduce electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancies would lead to a reverse effect. The oxygen vacancy contents in VO2 can be regulated and Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum vacancy concentration achieves a good performance with high capacity, long cycle stability and high energy density.







Abstract
Vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) is a proper cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its shear structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and structure instability derived from the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the VO2 host hinder its further application. Defect engineering is a useful way to circumvent the limitations. Herein, oxygen&#8208;defect VO2 (Od&#8208;VO2) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration are obtained via a facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal method by adjusting ascorbic acid addition. It is proved that oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduced electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancy content would lead to a reverse effect. The Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum oxygen vacancy concentration achieves an outstanding performance with a high capacity of 380 mAhg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A g&#8722;1, excellent cycle stability with 92.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 197&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.641&#8197;kW kg&#8722;1. Therefore, this defect engineering method for Od&#8208;VO2 provides an attractive way for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry With Collision Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinide gas phase chemistry: When uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) are subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation, the resulting fragment ion products reflect UPCs solid&#8208;state chemistry. Although the peroxo groups exact chemistry is not preserved, the presence of superoxo groups is observed, which suggests that electrochemical reactions of peroxo groups are taking place at the capillary tip of the ESI.







Abstract
Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) was utilized to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8722; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.

         <title>Indolocarbazole&#8208;Based Multiple&#8208;Resonance Molecules: an Emerging Class of Full&#8208;Color, Narrowband Emitters for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indolocarbazole&#8208;based emitters have recently emerged as a class of acceptor&#8208;free multiple resonance emitters, exhibiting extremely small FWHMs, good color&#8208;tunability from violet to deep red and excellent stability in OLED devices, which are ideal as end emitters in sensitizer&#8208;type OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitters based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs to generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;tetracarbonyl Complexes with [[EQUATION]] Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present stable and crystalline chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = mesoionic carbene) ligands and weakly coordinating anions (WCA = [Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, RF = C(CF3)3 and BArF = [B(ArF)4]&#8211;, ArF = 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). The complexes were fully characterized via crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The influence of counter anions on the IR and EPR spectroscopic properties of the CrI complexes was investigated, and the electronic innocence vs. non&#8208;innocence of WCAs was probed. These are the first examples of stable and crystalline [Cr(CO)4]+ complexes with a chelating [[EQUATION]] accepting ligand, and the data presented here are of relevance for both the photochemical and the electrochemical properties of these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>From Terminal to Spiro&#8208;Phosphonium Acceptors, Remarkable Moieties to Develop Polyaromatic NIR Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as a promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring the phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to the anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8211;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs = 527 nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955; = 805 nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934; &lt; 0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797 nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency of as high as &#934; = 0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge transfer chromophores.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactions of a cyclic (alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized beryllium radical with E2Ph2 (E = S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E = S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8210;E bonds are best described by the interaction between the Be+ and E&#8211; fragments, with Coulombic forces accounting for ca. 55% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulphur Dioxide Oxidation by Zinc and Zinc Oxide Nitrate/Nitrite Complexes in the Gas Phase:&#160;An Interplay between Redox&#8208;Active Ligands and Metal.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different oxidative pathways of sulphur dioxide promoted by ZnO(NO3)2&#8208;, Zn(NO3)2&#8208;&#160;and Zn(NO2)(NO3)&#8208;&#160;are revealed by a joint investigation of mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. The reactions are triggered by the [Zn+2&#8208;O&#8208;&#8226;]+ or by the low&#8208;valence Zn+&#160;via oxygen ion transfer or electron transfer to SO2, respectively. The NOx&#8208;&#160;ligands intervene in the oxidation only when sulphur dioxide is converted to SO3&#8208;&#160;or SO2&#8208;, leading to the formation of zinc sulphate and zinc sulphite coordinated to nitrate or nitrite anions. Kinetic analyses show that the reactions are fast and efficient, and theory discloses the elementary steps, namely oxygen ion transfer, oxygen atom transfer and electron transfer, occurring through similar energy landscapes for the three reactive anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorenylidene&#8208;Cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;Based Asymmetric Bistricyclic Aromatic Ene Compounds: Synthesis and Substituents Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8208;OMe, &#8208;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angels around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8208;SMe group can provide additional S&#183;&#183;&#183;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8208;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8208;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution via Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to the construction of a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of supramolecular assembly composed of a [Co2Fe2] complex via a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). The [Co2Fe2] complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed the thermal ETCST. On the other hand, the thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor (HBD) caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled onedimensional (1D) chains through hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) formations.</dc:description>

On the other hand, the thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled onedimensional (1D) chains through hydrogen-bond (HB) formations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Xanthene Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including TD&#8208;DFT, ACID, and NICS. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond activation reactions (OH, NH) of stereoisomeric disilenes are often 100&#8201;% stereospecific. Although we have a good understanding of the possible reaction pathways to the isomeric products, without a deeper understanding of the influence of the geometry of the disilene and the influence of the substituents on each elementary step, it remains difficult to predict the stereochemistry of the products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100&#8201;% stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable time normalization analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04&#177;0.06 at 298&#8197;K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The formation of the donor adduct is the rate determining step. The results of this study, together with previous studies on the addition of ammonia and amines to disilenes, allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.

         <title>The Uncertain Role of Nominations for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize Nomination Archives provides the names of the nominators and their nominees for the chemistry prize from 1901 to 1970. This data gives insights into the selection of the Nobel Laureates. One of the more unusual observations is an up&#8208;down&#8208;up nomination trend for many of the chemistry laureates at the very end of their nomination profiles. Some chemistry laureates received very few nominations; and some non&#8208;laureates received many nominations. The nomination patterns are often curious and always informative.







Abstract
The solicitation of nominations for the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry (NPch) is and has been the first step in the selection process since the very first awards were made in 1901. The number of nominations solicited by and provided to the Nobel Committee for Chemistry supports the belief by the nominators that their nominations are meaningful. In this publication, we examine data culled from the Nobel Prize Nomination Archives for the period 1901&#8211;1970 of the variable role of nominations in the selection process for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The evidence is overwhelming that nominations, in general, during the 1901&#8211;1970 period have not been the deciding, overriding factor in the selection of the recipients of the NPch. Rather, we posit that nominations from the preselected nominator&#8208;pool have been a source of information for the Committee, used to suggest future years&#8217; contenders and possibly served as motivation for the Committee to seek nominations for specific nominees for future years. It is also clear that selections are often influenced by personal prejudices, for example, friendships, rivalries, and nationality.

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;Electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Two mechanisms are uncovered that control fluorescence through N&#8208;protonation in nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes. The first mechanism regulates the transition to a &#960;&#960;* TICT state, while the second applies when a nonradiative decay pathway dominates, involving a dark n&#960;* state that is also accompanied by structural twisting and can be considered a type of TICT state.







Abstract
N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, the excited state deactivation processes are systematically investigated for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. Two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation are concluded: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. The current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>

Nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks possess superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticle closely mimics the active site of CuZn&#8208;SOD and exhibits exceptional SOD&#8208;like activity and recyclability due to its numerous copper active sites. These porous nanoparticles hold promise for future applications.







Abstract
Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.

We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole, CuZn-ZIF-8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn-ZIF-8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD-like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control: How can allosteric sites be more effectively targeted by small&#8208;molecule drugs? Using an integrated in&#8197;vitro/in silico experimental workflow; we discovered novel allosteric inhibitors of caspase&#8208;7 and revealed new connections between the active site and the remote allosteric site (i.&#8201;e., allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships, ASARs) for this valuable disease target.







Abstract
Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.&#8201;g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small&#8208;molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle by using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation by neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs).

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling in Water and Organic Solvents Promoted by Blends of Stabilized Convoluted Polymeric Palladium Catalysts and Polymeric Auxiliary Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and stable catalytic system, which was developed by blending a functional copolymer self&#8208;assembled palladium catalyst with polymeric auxiliary material, allows the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of various biphenyls in organic solvents or water as the sole solvent.







Abstract
Given that heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation reactions under continuous&#8208;flow conditions are well suited for the efficient and safe production of pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the development of active and durable catalysts for this purpose is a matter of high practical significance. Here, a previously established molecular convolution methodology was used to synthesize catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under flow conditions by blending convoluted polymeric palladium catalysts (prepared from copolymers of 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene) and crosslinked polymeric auxiliary materials (prepared from copolymers of divinylbenzene and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene). The optimal catalyst exhibited high performance and durability and allowed numerous biaryl products such as liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, organic electroluminescent materials, and pharmaceuticals to be continuously synthesized with turnover frequencies of up to 238&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a demonstration of practical utility, the developed catalytic system was used for the continuous synthesis of two pharmaceuticals (felbinac and fenbufen) in water as the sole solvent.

         <title>Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric unimolecular nanozyme Co&#8208;1 with three&#8208;level coordination spheres as a mimic of CODH is reported herein. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction in aqueous solution was achieved with a TONCO of 1731.2, which is comparable to most of molecular catalysts in water. Mechanism study discloses that this structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic can stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate and capture CO2 to improve catalytic activity and selectivity in the similar way as CODH.







Abstract
Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis is reported. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm), the as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a turnover number (TONCO) of 1731.2 in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is comparable to most reported molecular catalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center and the amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, whereas the PDMAEMA shell renders both water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by Forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;Transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels were developed by forming robust hydrazide&#8208;Zn2+ coordination complexes. The mechanical properties of the resultant gels exhibited a notable temperature dependence and thus a good shape&#8208;memory ability due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. The reactive amine group of the hydrazide enables facile surface modification and functionalization based on Schiff's base reactions.







Abstract
Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is an effective way to toughen hydrogels for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Here a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions is reported. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides a reactive site for Schiff's base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy to synthesize and can coordinate very well with several transition metals. Such a metal&#8208;ligand coordination should be suitable to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.

         <title>&#963;,&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bis(germylene) Adducts with NHC and CAACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both N&#8208;heterocyclic and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (NHC and CAACs) form the carbene coordinated &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugated adducts from one and the same bis(germylene). Their structures and properties are fundamentally different: while the strong Ge=C double bonds in the bis(germene) outperform the dative bonds in the NHC adduct, the latter serves as precursor for polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the reaction with triphenylborane.







Abstract
Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.

         <title>Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Room Temperature Phosphorescence Supramolecular Assembly with Extraordinary Stimulus&#8208;responsive Features from Nonaromatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular hybrid co&#8208;assemblies is proposed (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional layered aminoclay (AC) and various nonconjugated amino acid via simple and environmentally friendly magnetic stirring strategy, which exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water and multilevel information encryption application.







Abstract
Achieving stimulus&#8208;responsive performance in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different &#960; and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors&#8208;tunable performances are mainly owing to the co&#8208;existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water, yet their RTP performance can be maintained in other solvents, such as ethanol (EtOH). By virtue of this unique feature, multilevel information encryption application were demonstrated. This work provides a unique insight and more deep understanding on designing novel RTP systems without classic conjugated groups. Importantly, their extraordinary stimulus&#8208;responsive performances endow these RTP systems with a highly promising potential for intelligent information encryption applications.

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical and DFT investigations of the redox behaviours of a series of hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substitution at the bridge&#8208;head atom show that, in the same experimental conditions, the dithiolate bulk exerts a control in the ordering of reduction potentials (inverted vs. normal) and in the timing of the structural changes coupled to the electron transfers.







Abstract
Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X=CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn=CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2&#8197;M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depends on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8722;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et&#8594;Bn replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 promoted the aldol condensation in a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reaction. The investigation of the system showed that the cobalt catalyst and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the aldol condensation in a cooperative fashion. Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 activates the aldehyde product by adsorption, as shown by DFT.







Abstract
The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17&#8197;times compared to that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5&#8197;times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation.

The addition of Zn-MOF-74 to the cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-hexene enables tandem HF-AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17&#8197;times compared to that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5&#8197;times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn-MOF-74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier-transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn-MOF-74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how the regioselectivity between [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions of tropone can be steered by the use of Lewis acids, which catalyze the reactions via a LUMO&#8208;lowering effect.







Abstract
We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12&#8197;kcal mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator undergoes disulphide bond formation and forms a self&#8208;supporting, thixotropic, insoluble hydrogel via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. The resultant hydrogelator was exploited to remove toxic organic dyes from contaminated water in the gel phase and solid supports, indicating its potential applicability for water remediation.







Abstract
A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, and allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are further amenable to functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimides/Polyvinyl Alcohol Coassembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we proposed a delicate strategy based on a coassembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and varies to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is tactfully achieved via an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel coassembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A solid polymer electrolyte is developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material employes crystalline polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity over than 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C, Li+ transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4 V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08 V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400 &#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200 &#176;C without significant weight loss, while FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy suggests the dissolution of the LiTFSI conducting salt in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid state cells with various cathodes, including olivine LiFePO4 exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8208;carbon composite operating through Li&#8208;conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.e., ORR/OER) evolve on carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells reversibly operate at the room temperature with a capacity of 140 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3.4 V for LiFePO4, 400 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 V for sulfur electrode, and 500 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2.5 V for oxygen.

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzofused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho-quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane-fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzofused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;-aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7-dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio- and regioselectivities. Post-cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole-based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;alkylated pyridoxal derivatives as negative electrolyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries: Computational screening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications.

         <title>A Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Well&#8208;Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.e. 4800 cm&#8722;1, brightness ca. 80,000 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150 GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and novel merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanometer Metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773 K, even in the presence of 0.15 mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.</dc:description>

All of the target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating&#160;unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformations, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong CD signals with positive Cotton effect.

         <title>Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells and their interaction with the [10]cycloparaphenylene nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules bridged by isosorbide \ isomannide moieties. Their electrochemical behaviour and complexation with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were also investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of fullerene dumbbells showed high electron affinity, highlighting their ability to interact well with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which are charge and shape complementary. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and additional information about binding stoichiometries was obtained by NMR titration experiments.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe the synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell-shaped fullerene molecules bridged by isosorbide \ isomannide moieties. Their electrochemical behaviour and complexation with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were also investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of fullerene dumbbells showed high electron affinity, highlighting their ability to interact well with electron-donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which are charge and shape complementary. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and additional information about binding stoichiometries was obtained by NMR titration experiments. Two different approaches were used, resulting in bridged cyclopropane- and furan-based structures. Regardless of the type of linker, all derivatives formed conventional 2:1 complexes [10]CPP2&#8835;C60 derivative. However, the methano-dumbbell molecules showed different binding behaviour as mono-, bis-pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected. The formation of linear polymers could be of great importance for solar energy conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reexamine the emergence and stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ linear pentablock and $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as
the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. We demonstrate that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding abilities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M = Ru/Os; dppm = 1,1bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF, obtaining&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% selectivity of DFF with the synergistic effect of &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2. This study shows that Cs2SnBr6&#8208;based perovskite provides more possibilities and options in employing highly efficient and environment&#8208;stable lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6 is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic-inorganic lead-based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology-friendly, air-stable and highly active metal-halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead-free perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as-prepared Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo-driven-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&amp;gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo-driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Haloalkenyl Boronates by Halogenative Semipinacol Rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen&#8208;induced halogenative semipinacol rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols is reported herein. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions to access a variety of synthetically valuable carbonyl&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates with moderate to good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, as it allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Herein a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) by aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities is reported. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8722;B and C&#8722;X (X=Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the right amount of an easily available chromium(III) complex bearing a bulky acetylacetonato ligand to keep it chemically inert, NMR spectra acquired in continuous flow give much better data due to significantly reduced polarisation and relaxation times without undue peak broadening or loss of 2D methods.







Abstract
Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence times of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical for low sensititvity nuclei at low concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] are investigated for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III) acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds, successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at PRA concentrations as low as 10&#8197;mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions. Compatibility with a range of representative transition metal complexes often used in homogeneous catalysis has been investigated, and application of [Cr(tmhd)3] in significantly improving 1H and 31P{1H} FlowNMR data quality in a Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylation reaction has been demonstrated. With the PRA added, 13C relaxation times were reduced more than six&#8208;fold, allowing quantitative reaction monitoring of substrate consumption and product formation by 13C{1H} FlowNMR spectroscopy at natural abundance.

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Element&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed from dialdiminate complexes containing Group&#8197;13 elements. Alteration of the central elements results in a shift in the absorption wavelength, an enhancement of the responsiveness toward Lewis bases, and the appearance of the ligand exchange reactions. In this paper, the mechanisms are explored.







Abstract
Novel luminescent dialdiminate complexes of the Group&#8197;13 elements were prepared to evaluate the effects of the central element on their properties. We demonstrate that their absorption wavelength and the response to Lewis bases apparently depend on the central atom. The aluminum complex exhibited the absorption band in the higher&#8208;energy region than the gallium and indium congeners. Theoretical calculations suggest that the aluminum complex has a lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than the other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity of the aluminum complex clearly changed in response to a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could originate from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.

         <title>Remote Electronic Effect of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyst on an Asymmetric Benzoin Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of remote electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst increased enantioselectivity of the benzoin reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. The increased enantioselectivity was rationalized by DFT calculations with noncovalent&#8208;interaction and distortion/interaction&#8208;energy analyses.







Abstract
A remote electronic effect of chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst on an asymmetric benzoin reaction was investigated. The catalyst bearing remote electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents increased enantioselectivity of the reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. DFT calculations rationalized the increased enantioselectivity.
