         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as nanovalves. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid groups grafted onto the gold nanoparticles increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>BACTERIA AT WORK &#8208; EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES REVEAL THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF ECTOINE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu&#8208;57, Tyr&#8208;84 and His&#8208;92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide.&#160;The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is essential for achieving both high energy density and enhanced safety in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A well&#8208;functioning ISE/Li interface plays a pivotal role in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. Poor interface contact and stability can lead to the deterioration of ASSLMB performance. Hence, various interface modification methods are employed to enhance the ISE/Li interface.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has sparked a growing interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and an effective ISE/Li interface is a key factor in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this Concept, we initially summarize the challenges encountered by ISE/Li interfaces and delineate four commonly employed strategies for modifying the ISE/Li interface. Then, we explore the merits and drawbacks of coatings utilized as ISE/Li interfacial phases. We also delve into the commonly employed thermal bonding and innovative cold bonding methods utilized for in&#8197;situ interface preparation. Lastly, we spotlight future directions for enhancing the functionality of ISE/Li interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand Bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across Two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>

Pyridine moieties, which are electronically isolated from each other by saturated atom chains, can be potentially redox&#8208;active in complexes. Thus, structural and spectroscopic methods in combination with theoretical calculations provide unequivocal evidence that the coordinated tetraazamacrocyclic ligand L&#8208;N4Me2 in the stable neutral bis(acetato)chromium complex indeed contains anionic pyridine radical units coordinated to a chromium(III) ion.







Abstract
In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2)&#8901;&#8722; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Highly Crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

Highly crystalline LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333) was synthesized through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis. With this crystalline product, it was possible for the first time to elucidate the crystal structure of LiMoS2 by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The arrangement of Mo atoms in the b&#8208;c plane confirms a predicted Peierls distortion.







Abstract
LixMoS2 is not only a lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2, such as in n&#8208;butyllithium/LiBH4 or electrochemically, are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material has been long awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333). 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group P
 with a=6.2482(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=6.6336(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.7480(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=119.321(2)&#176;, &#946;=90.010(2)&#176; and &#947;=90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirmed a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern to that of Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244&#8197;eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x=1.333, a phase&#8208;pure synthesis was achieved.

         <title>Enhanced Hydroxyl Adsorption in Ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple topotactic transformation strategy is presented to construct ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures as a desired platform for tailoring the d band centers and further electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterointerface is more active toward alkaline methanol oxidation, which may hold great promise in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge transfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.

Extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores were prepared and their redox and optical properties studied in comparison to the known extended TTF with an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core. The dications of these compounds were found to be singlet states that may correspond to closed shell quinoid structures or open shell singlet diradical structures &#8208; for the diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene core, these structures are isoenergetic. The various charge states were differentiated by unique UV/Vis/NIR absorptions.







Abstract
In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from &#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core. The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) xy scans.

         <title>Silicon Chalcogenide Cage Compounds: New Structures Derived from the Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New silicon chalcogenide cage compounds with amino substituents have been derived from reactions of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with the chalcogen transfer agents Me3NO and propylenesulfide and with the chalcogens red selenium and tellurium in one step. This resulted into the first T4 silsesquioxane, defect&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;type clusters with three Si&#8722;Si bonds and a ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane.







Abstract
The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 (2) was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This resulted in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO, a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. Reactions with propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8722;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane 6.

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;Free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>

Selectivity of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in aqueous media is tuned by varying pH; redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole (ImBenz) catalyst with a NO2 substituent at pH&#8197;7 favors H2O production, and ImBenz without substituent at pH&#8197;13 favors H2O2 production.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n=3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n=2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines Using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for the regioselective I&#8208;branching of polylactosamines is described. Enzyme promiscuity is exploited to generate oligosaccharides functionalized with traceless blocking groups. Multiple oligosaccharides are synthesized to demonstrate that the blocking group selectively directs enzymatic I&#8208;branch regioselectivity. This methodology allows the synthesis of polylactosamines of various topologies.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based on the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.

         <dc:description>
We report the oxidative dimerization reaction of siloxydienes derived from simple enones that creates a new gamma&#8208;gamma (&#947;&#8208;&#947;) C&#8722;C bond using catalytic iron and benzoyl peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetonitrile solvent at ambient temperature. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope including cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes derived from ketones, aldehydes, and esters, which are converted to 1,8&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds under mild catalytic reaction conditions in 19&#8211;89&#8201;% yield across 30 examples. The method is suitable for the coupling of sterically demanding carbon centers, including the formation of vicinal quaternary centers. Conceptually, the dienol ether serves as a precursor to a conjugated radical cation, which undergoes highly site selective &#947;&#8208;dimerization reactions. The &#947;&#8208;&#947; dimerization strategy is applied to the synthesis of a bioactive analogue of honokiol.

         <title>NDI based C2&#8208;symmetric Chiral Supramolecular Hydrogels Towards Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The goal of the development of C2&#8208;symmetrical conductive supramolecular hydrogels was to attain uniformity and structural stability. The co&#8208;assembly with bipyridine functional group isomers line up within the gel&#8216;s framework and make channels for electron transmission, and improves their conductivity. By combining the advantages of the two design approaches, this synergistic method produces hydrogels with improved mechanical and conductive properties for possible use in a variety of bio&#8208;electronic devices in personalized healthcare and other bio&#8208;engineering areas.







Abstract
To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;Degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

A differential sensing approach is demonstrated to distinguish distinct aging status of mouse using TCF probes. Despite there is no reliable CD markers selective for aging progress, cross&#8208;reactivity of TCF probes generates unique fingerprint of aging by blood cell analysis.







Abstract
Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. In this work, differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds are introduced that are designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. Precise discrimination of blood samples from 37&#8197;mice was demonstrated based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19&#8197;weeks of age. Additionally, this fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

Dehydrogenation of primary and secondary silanes and germanes via a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative process affords base&#8208;stabilized silylene and germylene complexes that can serve as synthons of free &#8220;:ER2&#8221; (E=Si, Ge).







Abstract
Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L=&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217;=2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8722;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes=mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tetrylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E=Si: R=Mes, H, 2; R=Et, 5; E=Ge: R=Ph, 6; R=tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E=Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing :ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral aza/boracyclophanes that show unique dependence of the racemization energy barriers on macrocyclic conformations with distinct substitution patterns, and the ring constraints also impact as compared with the open&#8208;chain structures.







Abstract
We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analogues p&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative&#8208;position control of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules in charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes without changing their molecular structures has been demonstrated. Different relative positions enabled the CT complexes to exhibit different emission wavelengths and different luminescence processes derived from CT interaction in the ground state, an exciplex, and CT interaction with the electron&#8208;acceptor dimer.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties that depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing the molecular structures has not been explored. Herein, we report control of the relative position based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant modulation of the luminescent properties. Six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared from anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines. Different alkylamines&#8242; steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624&#8197;nm and different luminescence processes.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>

A compound collection inspired by both biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural product design concepts was rapidly accessed by divergent synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles.







Abstract
Design strategies that can access natural&#8208;product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid&#8208;inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress in&#8197;vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with Ketone Selectivity by a Cobalt(IV)&#8208;Oxo Embedded in a &#946;&#8208;Barrel Protein</title>

Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of 3&#8208;Substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones via Non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>

Herein, we present an efficient enantioselective amination of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones utilizing non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The process is applicable to various functionalized substrates and it is found to be scalable. Mechanistic investigations based on control experimental and DFT studies suggest that the reaction operates via non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.

         <title>Influence of Crystallographic Structure and Metal Vacancies on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ni&#8208;based Layered Hydroxides

The &#945;&#8208;layered hydroxide (LH) phase with Ni vacancies is the most electroactive catalyst among LH structures containing exclusively Ni(II).







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;&#8208;LH, &#946;&#8208;LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical, in&#8208;silico and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni&#8208;vacancies in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase that remains stable under ambient conditions. Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis. We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for hosting trivalent cations, closing the gap toward the next generation of benchmark efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.

A direct allylic sulfonylation reaction: Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. We report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions to combat their synthetic barrier.







Abstract
Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism for radical sulfonylation is proposed from the control experiments.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalysed Csp2&#8722;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
One step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol&#8208;PAH is performed.







Abstract
Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographenes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.

         <title>Classical Gold Carbonyl Complexes in Tetrahedral and Trigonal&#8208;Planar Settings</title>

Pyridyl&#8208;borate scorpionates decorated with anionic and fluoro&#8208;alkyl groups serve as ideal ligands to capture gold(I)&#8208;carbon monoxide fragments in trigonal planar and tetrahedral environments that display remarkably low C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, and have significant Au&#8722;CO &#960;&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated by using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of trends in the coinage&#8208;metal family. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold&#8211;carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8722;O stretch value, but with trigonal planar geometry at the gold. A computational analysis shows that the AuI&#8722;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand&#8208;supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au &#963;&#8208;donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, which are lower than in free CO.

         <title>Electronic Effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII Complexes upon Varying the N Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consequences of varying the substituent of the N atom in bidentate (P,PN) ligand was studied experimentally and theoretically within 3 series of palladium(II) complexes featuring also chlorides and/or isocyanides. The alkyl substituted complexes exhibit the higher stability while the H and trimethylsilyl containing counterparts were the most sensitive. For the latter, charge differences within the complexes were shown.







Abstract
Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes&#8197;1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1&#8201;a), a phenyl (Ph, 1&#8201;b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1&#8201;c) group or an H atom (1&#8201;d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8722;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2&#8201;a&#8211;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3&#8201;a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchimeric interaction with an sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation with iodine affords an isolable acid&#8208;base complex. The N&#8722;I bonding is non&#8208;covalent but rather strong, while the O&#8722;I bond of the ligand is ionic and weak, facilitating ligand exchange in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid. The generated I+ cation species can be employed for &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones.







Abstract
Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8722;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8722;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8722;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8722;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8722;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8722;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials Containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.







Abstract
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8211;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.

     alt="Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone-Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late-Stage Transformation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and late-stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X-ray crystallography.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2-(9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluoren-9-ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late-stage functionalization of the fluorenone-based rings by high-yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused-ring-system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi-redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi-reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromine Substitution Improves the Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine substitution enhances the photothermal properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic molecules; this is the outcome of a combination of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The results demonstrate that bromine substitution is promising for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal agents.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8211;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet clinical requirements. In this work, we developed a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#1013;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two times more heat (&#1013;808&#8197;nm&#215;PCE) than their unsubstituted counterpart. We disclose that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine substitution is a promising strategy for developing future high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents.

The cover feature represents the crystal structure of LiMoS2. It consists of slightly distorted MoS2 layers with lithium sandwiched in between, illustrated as isosurfaces for potential lithium mobility. The compound is notoriously difficult to prepare with high crystallinity. Now, a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis has allowed the elucidation of the crystal structure. Thus, the tungsten carbide cubes of the multianvil press used at the Innsbruck laboratory encompass the structure. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Schwarzm&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302565).

Dehydrogenation of Group 13 and 14 substrates has been explored by using a rhodium pincer complex. While primary and secondary silanes and germanes are able to release H2 (blast off!), generating silylene and germylene compounds, the grounded boron and tin symbolize synthetic challenges with respect to this process. The same rhodium complex is able to catalyze the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes/germanes with pinacol; an example product is illustrated as a constellation in the night sky.

The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in synthesis and application.







Abstract
Diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo compounds have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and achievement of using IL&#8208;confinement in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL&#8208;confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.







Abstract
The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The progress and achievement of using IL-confinement in developing quasi-solid-state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL-confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL-confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so-called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL-confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL-confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, that is, the IL-confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70 ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34 s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Induced Oxidative Cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;C, and C(sp3)&#8722;N Bonds of Nitriles, Alcohols, and Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a visible&#8208;light mediated oxidative cleavage of unstrained C&#8722;C(sp3) and C&#8722;N(sp3) bonds of nitriles, alcohols (diols), and amines using Acr+&#8208;Mes/Selectfluor/DMAP system and O2 as the oxidant.







Abstract
Selective cleavage of unstrained (sp3) C&#8722;C/ C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions is highly challenging due to the higher bond dissociation energy. A visible light mediated metal&#8208;free oxidative dehomologation of aryl acetonitriles, primary alcohols and diols to carboxylic acids via organophotocatalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;CN, C(sp3)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage is reported. Notably, this methodology was further extended towards selective synthesis of aldehydes via deamination of both primary as well as secondary amines. This mild protocol features wide array of substrate variation with excellent functional group tolerance, preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, and operational simplicity. Possible mechanisms for these transformations were demonstrated through a series of control experiments.

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After more than 35&#8197;years, the search for the single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of tert&#8208;butyllithium with tetrahydrofuran ends successfully. However, contrary to expectations, two different aggregates depending on the amount of THF used could be determined in non&#8208;polar environment, which also differ significantly in their reactivity. Thus, opening up a simple way for synthetic chemists to tune the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi according to their application.







Abstract
In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8722;H&#8722;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in&#8197;situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!

Chemodivergent [3+3] annulations: The reactivity of Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoid has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones to deliver functionalized 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,2&#8208;DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines respectively. The structural diversification of 1,2&#8208;DHP and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines gave valuable piperidines, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, 2&#8208;pyridone, hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydroquinolines, and tetrahydroquinolinones.







Abstract
Novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] annulations of diazoenals and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has been disclosed here. The reactivity of diazoenals has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones. In this direction, we report an efficient strategy to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formyl group is necessary for carbenoid [3+3] annulation and the cyclohexyl group is the dictating factor for vinylogous NH&#8208; insertion. The synthetic utility of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines was demonstrated by synthesizing piperidine, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, and 2&#8208;pyridone scaffolds. Further, structural diversification of fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines resulted in the short synthesis of hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydro quinolines and tetrahydroquinolinones via ring opening rearrangement and a new oxidative deformylation, respectively.

         <title>In&#8208;situ construction of poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based gel polymer electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for high energy density lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LLTO&#8208;containing PAN was prepared by electrostatic spinning as a polymer matrix, which was subsequently used to prepared gel polymer electrolyte by in&#8208;situ polymerization. The obtained gel polymer electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity and lithium&#8208;ion transference number, which assembles to form a high energy density lithium metal battery with excellent performance.







Abstract
As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and a high lithium transfer number (tLi+) of 0.85 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550&#8197;h at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58&#8201;% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Construction and Application of a Pepsin&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework with Prominent Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pepsin@ Covalent Organic Framework (Pepsin@COF) was constructed for enantioselective adsorption and chromatographic enantioseparation. Serving as a protective &#8220;armor&#8221;, the COF ensures the safeguarding of the enzyme, while the enzyme itself offers sites for chiral recognition. This research uncovers a first&#8208;time correlation between enzyme chiral recognition and activity, expanding biocomposite design and enriching the CSP library.







Abstract
The stable Pepsin@covalent organic framework (Pepsin@COF) were constructed base on matching COF pore diameter to pepsin dimension. It exhibits excellent chiral recognition capabilities (e.&#8201;e.&#8201;% up to 62.63&#8201;%) and potential for enantioseparation. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the immobilized enzyme activity and chiral recognition was revealed, offering insights for the design of biocatalytic nanosystems in chiral separation.

         <title>CARBON DOTS: Bioimaging and Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores Carbon Dots (CDs) in cancer treatment, highlighting their synthesis, bioimaging applications, and role in drug delivery. The review details potential barriers to drug delivery, and details recent studies and developments, with a focus on the use of CDs as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems designed for the delivery of doxorubicin.







Abstract
Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It further explores CDs&#8242; synthesis, including both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs&#8242; role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field. Finally, we showcase examples of other promising bioapplications of CDs, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds in the Ebselen Class of Antioxidants Probed by X&#8208;ray Quantum Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveal that the nature of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen class of antioxidants is akin to dynamic bonds, with electronic features intermediary to covalent and ionic bonds.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds are essential structural ingredients of dynamic covalent chemistry that involve reversible cleavage and formation of bonds. Herein, we explore the electronic characteristics of Se&#8722;N bonds in the organo&#8208;selenium antioxidant ebselen and its derivatives for their propensity to function as dynamic covalent bonds by employing high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography and complementary computational studies. An analysis of the experimentally reconstructed X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveals the salient electronic features of the Se&#8722;N bonds with very low electron density localized at the bonding region and a positive Laplacian value at the bond critical point. Bond orders and percentage covalency and ionicity estimated from the X&#8208;ray wavefunctions, along with localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses show that the Se&#8722;N bond is unique in its closed shell&#8208;like features, despite being a covalent bond. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations simulate the cleavage of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen in the excited state, further substantiating their nature as dynamic bonds.

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble triazolium covalent cages for ATP sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two water&#8208;soluble organic cages were synthesized through a three&#8208;fold click reaction, followed by N&#8208;methylation and anion exchange. The cages bind to the HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) dye and quench its emission. The cage&#8834;HPTS complexes exhibit turn&#8208;on emission to sense ATP with a nanomolar detection limit, both in water and in human serum matrix.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble organic cages are attractive targets for their molecular recognition and sensing features of biologically relevant molecules. Here, we have successfully designed and synthesized a pair of water&#8208;soluble cationic cages employing click reaction as the fundamental step followed by the N&#8208;methylation of the triazole rings. The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent 3D hydrophobic cavity, positively charged surface, H&#8208;bonding triazolium rings, and excellent water solubility empower both cages to exhibit a superior affinity and selectivity for binding with adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) compared to cyclophanes and other macrocyclic receptors. Both cage molecules (PCC&#8901;Cl and BCC&#8901;Cl) can bind a highly emissive dye HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) to form non&#8208;fluorescent complexes. The addition of ATP resulted in the stronger cage&#8834;ATP complexes with the retention of HPTS emission upon its displacement. The resultant indicator&#8208;displacement assay system can efficiently sense and quantify ATP in nanomolar detection limits in buffer solutions and human serum matrix. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interaction between the aromatic moiety of the cationic cages and the adenine moiety of ATP, as well as the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction between the phosphate anion of ATP and triazole protons of cages, played the pivotal roles in the sensing process.

The depicted stainless steel autoclave is the heart of the presented methodology. It allows the performance of the method's key steps, which are the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation. The resulting dipyrromethanes are directly converted to highly fluorescent meso&#8208;alkyl and &#8208;aryl BODIPYs in yields of up to 78&#8201;% over five consecutive steps from stable and readily available alkenes or aryl bromides. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Breit and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303752).

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8722;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Although formate is an inactive molecule which cannot be further reduced, this work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into active CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.







Abstract
Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) on Fe&#8722;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8722;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8901;&#8722; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8722;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation between 1.14 and 1.4&#8197;V and an optimized potential at 1.24&#8197;V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8901;&#8722; at 1.24&#8197;V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt;1.4&#8197;V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.

         <title>Synthesis of the Reducing&#8208;end Hexasaccharide Fragment of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly protected hexasaccharide relevant to the reducing&#8208;end half of telomerase inhibitor axinelloside A was synthesized. Features of the synthetic approach include (1) preparation of the scyllo&#8208;inositol unit via Ferrier&#8208;type&#8208;II rearrangement, (2) formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages via remote acyl group participation, and (3) concise [2+2+2] assembly by virtue of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of an orthogonally protected hexasaccharide relevant to the reducing&#8208;end half of axinelloside A, a highly sulfated marine lipopolysaccharide, is disclosed. The synthesis features preparation of the scyllo&#8208;inositol unit via a Ferrier&#8208;type&#8208;II rearrangement, construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds via remote participation, and concise [2+2+2] assembly via Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation.

         <title>A New Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework with High Iodine Capture Capacity and I&#8208;doping Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel COF was prepared. Structure of the COF was characterized by PXRD, TEM, BET and CV et&#8197;al. Theoretical simulation fit well in with experimental data, including XRD profile, layer distance, pore size and HOMO/LUMO energy level. The material showed high iodine capture capability and interaction between iodine and framework was studied. After iodine&#8208;doping, enhanced conductivity was observed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous organic materials with well&#8208;defined and uniform structure. The material is an excellent candidate as a solid adsorbent for iodine adsorption. In the present study, we report the synthesis of COF with porphyrin moiety, TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF, by solvothermal reaction, which was characterized by XRD, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, IR, TGA, and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption analysis. TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed a high specific surface area of 443&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibited good adsorption performance for iodine vapor, with an adsorption capacity of 2.74&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1. XPS and Raman spectrum indicated that a hybrid of physisorption and chemisorption took place between host COF and iodine molecules. The electric properties of iodine&#8208;loaded TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF were also studied. After doped with iodine, the conductivity of the material increased by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The photoconductivity of I2&#8208;doped COF was also studied and TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed doping&#8208;enhanced photocurrent generation.

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two components, pyridinic N&#8208;bonded iodine and sulfonate oxygen, stabilize in crystals via the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonding interaction validating the N&#8208;iodopyridinium sulfonate, (Pyridine)N&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OSO2R formula.







Abstract
Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8722;I bond lengths [2.140(3)&#8211;2.197(2)&#8197;&#197;] and the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds [2.345(6)&#8211;2.227(3)&#8197;&#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.

         <title>Hydroxytrifluoroethylation and Trifluoroacetylation Reactions via SET Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review we present the recent methods available in the literature for the direct introduction of hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups in organic molecules governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.







Abstract
Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.

         <title>Direct growth control of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria using visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive novel photoswitchable antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin with MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL of the cis isomer displayed 24&#8208;fold higher antibacterial potency than its trans isomer against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus strain MTCC96. The antimicrobial activity can be controlled by visible light with high spatiotemporal precision and retained for &gt;7&#8197;hours. These features render this molecule very attractive for photopharmacology applications.







Abstract
In addition to the discovery of new (modified) potent antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies that would restrict their off&#8208;target effects and unnecessary exposure to bacteria in our body and environment. We report a set of new photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin antibiotics that present a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, impressive fatigue resistance and reasonably high cis half&#8208;lives. The irradiated isomers of most compounds were found to exhibit nearly equal or higher antibacterial activity than norfloxacin against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Notably, against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant S.&#8197;aureus bacteria, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive p&#8208;SMe&#8208;substituted derivative showed remarkably high antimicrobial potency (MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL) in the irradiated state, while the potency was reduced by 24&#8208;fold in case of its non&#8208;irradiated state. The activity was estimated to be retained for more than 7&#8197;hours. This is the first report to demonstrate direct photochemical control of the growth of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and to show the highest activity difference between irradiated and non&#8208;irradiated states of a photoswitchable antibiotic. Additionally, both isomers were found to be non&#8208;harmful to human cells. Molecular modellings were performed to identify the underlying reason behind the high&#8208;affinity binding of the irradiated isomer to topoisomerase IV enzyme.

         <title>Aerobic Asymmetric Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Hydroquinone Catalysis</title>

A ternary and synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylation under aerobic conditions with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylation under aerobic conditions. The ternary synergistic catalysis enables a facile allylic C&#8722;H activation and alkylation with oxygen so that stoichiometric utilization of benzoquinone can be avoided. The identified optimal catalytic system allows for terminal addition to allyl arenes with &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls to afford allylic adducts bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work provides new insights for further studies on the aerobically oxidative C&#8722;H alkylation reaction.

Compound 1 displayed superior catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}&#8208;type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in a controlled manner. An unprecedented tristate switching mechanism can be achieved by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity of the solution. This allows the radical to be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer, which exhibit dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties. The addition of salt to the radialene catholyte solution in an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) converts the &#963;&#8208;dimer to the &#960;&#8208;dimer and increases the electrochemical reversibility and stability of the charged species, which are advantageous for galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge studies at neutral pH.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stimuli-responsive [3]radialene radical anions&lt;/b&gt; dimerize reversibly in a controlled manner. An unprecedented tristate switching mechanism can be achieved by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity of the solution. This allows the radical to be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;-dimer, and a &#963;-dimer, which exhibit dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties. The addition of salt to the radialene catholyte solution in an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) converts the &#963;-dimer to the &#960;-dimer and increases the electrochemical reversibility and stability of the charged species, which are advantageous for galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge studies at neutral pH.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8208;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#183;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8208; = 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#183;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2',2'',2'''&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2'&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42%).</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n = 5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF + Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped diamane sheets: A DFT study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8208;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;based Functional Glycopolymeric Nanoparticles as Fluorescent Probes for Selective Imaging of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8208;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8208;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8208;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Ugi Reactions versus In&#8208;Situ Ligation Screening: Two Roads to the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein&#8208;templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme assay, HPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS, and native protein MS with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native mass spectrometry and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non&#8208;templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;dimensional Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06 V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8210;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO on cadmium sulfide enhanced by chloride anion doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl&#8208;anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS&#8208;NF) using an in situ hydrothermal method. The Cl&#8208;anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1% on a Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25 V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05 V to &#8722;2.45 V and a maximum partial current density (192.6 mA cm&#8722;2) was achieved at &#8722;2.35 V. The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The electrophilic functionalization of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2( &#956; , &#951;  6:6  &#8208;P6)] (A) and its mono&#8208;oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}2( &#956; , &#951;  6:6  &#8208;P6)][SbF6] (B) with reactive main&#8208;group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphospha&#8208;benzene ligand.

         <title>Exploring electrophilic hydrophosphination via metal phosphenium intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Mo(0) phosphenium complexes containing ancillary secondary phosphine ligands have been investigated with respect to their ability to participate in electrophilic addition at unsaturated substrates and subsequent P&#8208;H hydride transfer to &#8220;quench&#8221; the resulting carbocations. These studies provide stoichiometric &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; for a proposed new metal&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic hydrophosphination mechanism. The more strongly Lewis acidic phosphenium complex, [Mo(CO)4(PR2H)(PR2)]+ (R = Ph, Tolp), cleanly hydrophosphinates 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene, while other substrates react rapidly to give products resulting from competing electrophilic processes. A less Lewis acidic complex, [Mo(CO)3(PR2H)2(PR2)]+, generally reacts more slowly but participates in clean hydrophosphination of a wider range of unsaturated substrates, including styrene, indene, 1&#8208;hexene, and cyclohexanone, in addition to 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene. Mechanistic studies are described, including stoichiometric control reactions and computational and kinetic analyses, which probe whether the observed P&#8208;H addition actually does occur by the proposed electrophilic mechanism, and whether hydridic P&#8208;H transfer in this system is intra&#8208; or intermolecular. Preliminary reactivity studies indicate challenges that must be addressed to exploit these promising results in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of the protactinium(V) mono&#8208;oxo cation probed by first&#8208;principle calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the distinctive behavior of Protactinium (Z = 91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, Protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+&#160;in aqueous phase.&#160;Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs' free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) &#8208;&gt; Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, NCS&#8208;, NO3&#8208;, and SO42&#8208; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8208;, F&#8208;, and C2O42&#8208; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, NCS&#8208;, and NO3&#8208;. These findings elucidate Protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

         <dc:description>
Our computations reveal that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is formed via the transfer of 2H+ and 2e&#8722; from the phenolic groups of the ligands to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core. This mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII is highly reactive towards the aliphatic C&#8722;H bond following a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Further, the role of an in&#8208;situ generated water molecule in aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation was also analysed.







Abstract
The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes place, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.

         <title>Trifluoroethylation and Pentafluoropropylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Concept summarizes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues. These reactions result in selective functionalization of saturated molecules allowing access to greater chemical space which is advantageous in medicinal chemistry.

Polyfluorinated substituents often enhance effectiveness, improve the stability within metabolic processes, and boost the lipophilicity of biologically active compounds. However, methods for their introduction into aliphatic carbon chains remain very limited. A potentially general route to integrate the fluorinated scaffolds into organic molecules involves insertion of fluorine&#8208;containing carbenes into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of perfluoroalkyl groups enhances the reactivity of these carbenes which should enable the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Curiously, it appears that use of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing carbenes in alkane C&#8722;H functionalization is exceedingly rare. This concept describes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues.

         <title>Cerium oxide catalyzed disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide: a closer look at the reaction intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the reaction mechanism of H2O2 disproportionation by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP). In aqueous dispersions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP interfaces triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo complexes. The CNP catalytic reactivity is explored, showing an increase with Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and a decrease in the presence of polymer coatings, offering insights for potential nanomedicine applications.







Abstract
Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have recently gained increasing interest as redox enzyme&#8208;mimetics to scavenge the intracellular excess of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Despite the extensive exploration, there remains a notable discrepancy regarding the interpretation of observed redshift of UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy due to H2O2 addition and the catalase&#8208;mimicking mechanism of CNPs. To address this question, we investigated the reaction mechanism by taking a closer look at the reaction intermediate during the catalase mimicking reaction. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that in aqueous solutions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP surface triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo (Ce&#8208;O22&#8722;) and/or cerium&#8208;hydroperoxo (Ce&#8208;OOH&#8722;) complexes as resolved by Raman scattering and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy. Polymer coating presents steric hinderance for H2O2 accessibility to the solid&#8208;liquid interface limiting further intermediate formation. We demonstrate in depth that the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the H2O2 disproportionation reaction increases with the Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and decreases in the presence of polymer coatings. The developed approach using UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy for the characterization of the surface peroxide species can potentially serve as a foundation for determining the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the disproportionation of H2O2.

A manganese&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of glycerol with amines for the synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;methylquinoxalines, 2&#8208;ethylbenzimidazoles, and &#945;&#8208;aminoketones was reported. NHC&#8208;based pincer manganese complex featuring a pyridine backbone displayed high catalytic activity and selectivity. No external oxidants were used in these reactions and hydrogen and water were produced as the only by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Glycerol is one of the important biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks and the high&#8208;value utilizations of glycerol have attracted much attentions in recent years. Herein, we report a manganese catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of glycerol with amines for the synthesis of substituted 2&#8208;methylquinoxalines, 2&#8208;ethylbenzimidazoles, and &#945;&#8208;aminoketones without any external oxidant. In these reactions, NHC&#8208;based pincer manganese complex featuring a pyridine backbone displayed high catalytic activity and selectivity, in which hydrogen and water were produced as the only by&#8208;products using glycerol as a C3 synthon.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There have been two pathways for PEC CO2 utilization to produce small molecule fuel and valuable chemicals, i.&#8201;e. PEC CO2 reduction and PEC CO2 fixation. The key to achieving high efficiency, yield and selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization on Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes lies in the rational design of the photoelectrode structure as well as the modulation of the composition, morphology, structure and size of the catalysts.







Abstract
CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1&#8197;eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy, a clover&#8208;like COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8722;Tz) were synthesized by simply adjusting the molar ratio of the monomers. Remarkably, NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet and congo red compared to the non&#8208;functionalized Ah&#8722;Tz.







Abstract
Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8722;Ah) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8722;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8722;Ah&#8722;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261&#8197;mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560&#8197;mg/g) compared to the non&#8208;functionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8722;Tz COF (123&#8197;mg/g for CV and 1340&#8197;mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is powerfully effective to boosting circularly polarized luminescence by the synergistic strategy that increases the intramolecular rigidity by reducing the chain length of alkylated axial scaffold and enhances the intermolecular interactions to restrict the intermolecular motions. Unusual and significant amplification of dissymmetry factor |glum| from 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;1 level was achieved in organic CPL system.







Abstract
Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of red&#8208;emitting BODIPY derivatives through a mild electrochemical diselenation process is reported. The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, photophysical characterization, computational analysis, and the demonstration of their potential as emission&#8208;tunable fluorescent probes with large Stokes shift for lipid droplet visualization, offering broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.







Abstract
We report a rapid, efficient, and scope&#8208;extensive approach for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red&#8208;shifted absorption &#8211; corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT and DLPNO&#8208;STEOM&#8208;CCSD computations &#8211; and color&#8208;tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium&#8208;containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize 1O2 and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77&#8197;K. Importantly, the selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission&#8208;tunable fluorophores with broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic compounds bearing a complex heterocyclic core such as an aromatic heterocycle &#8220;fused&#8221; with one or more functionalized rings, are widespread leading molecules in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Although many synthetic methodologies have been devised to access achiral, fused heteroaromatic scaffolds, or related chiral variants adorned with out&#8208;of&#8208;cycle stereogenic elements, equally efficient strategies to afford chiral heterocycles featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters, exist to a lesser extent and presently represent a growing field of investigation. The mild, organocatalytic generation of elusive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediates (oQDMs), derived from suitable heteroaromatic carbonyl&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;like pronucleophiles has recently proved successful in the synthesis of such peculiar chiral architectures via stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions.

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution at Phosphorus Centres &#8211; Old and Recent Studies and a Final Solution of Mechanistic and Related Stereochemical Problems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the selected results of the old and recent studies on the nucleophilic substitution reactions at the tetracoordinate phosphorus atom (SN&#8722;P(IV)). The stereochemistry [inversion, retention] and mechanisms [concerted SN2&#8722;P, stepwise (A&#8722;E)&#8722;P] of these reactions as well as their relationship are presented.







Abstract
Among many problems of a fundamental value in the heteroatom chemistry the mechanism and stereochemistry of the nucleophilic substitution reaction at the phosphorus and other heteroatom centres have attracted great attention of phosphorus chemists already in the middle of the last century. This review, which does not have a comprehensive character, summarizes the selected original contributions aimed at solution of the mechanism of SN2&#8722;P reaction and its relationship with stereochemistry. The breakthrough in these studies was the Westheimer's concept and his rules which is presented at the beginning of this article. Next, a series of papers is presented where the stereochemistry of the substitution at phosphorus was investigated in cyclic five&#8208;, four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring phosphorus compound. The majority of these reactions have been found to occur with retention of the P&#8208;configuration. In the third part of this account, the selected examples of substitution reactions at phosphorus in acyclic compounds are discussed. As the results of all the investigations discussed did not allow to undoubtedly ascribe the mechanism (SN2 or A&#8722;E) to the investigated reactions, in the last part the SN&#8208;P reactions are presented, the mechanism of which has been established by combination of the stereochemical and DFT&#8208;studies.

Carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) can take full advantage of sustainable power to reduce the continuously increasing carbon emissions. Recycling CO2 to produce formic acid or formate is a technologically and economically viable route to accomplish CO2 cyclic utilization. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with high selectivity towards formate is prioritized for the industrialized applications of CO2RR electrolysis. From the previous explored CO2RR catalysts, Sn, Bi and In based materials have drawn increasing attentions due to the high selectivity towards formate. However, there are still confronted with several challenges for the practical applications of these materials. Therefore, a rational design of the catalysts for formate is urgently needed for the target of industrialized applications. In this progress report, we review the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress of CO2RR catalysts (Sn, Bi, and In based materials) for formate in recent two years. We specifically focus on Sn, Bi, and In based nanomaterials and modification strategies for formate conversion. Firstly, the fundamental mechanism of CO2RR is comprehensively discussed. Secondly, the progresses along with different optimization strategies of advanced Sn, Bi, and In based nanomaterials for enhanced CO2RR performances are presented in detail. Finally, opportunities and perspectives of the catalysts are summarized, including the catalyst design, mechanistic clarification, application of in&#8197;situ characterization techniques, as well as cell architecture optimization.

         <title>A functional electrolyte containing P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive achieves the interphase stability of high nickel cathode in a wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive improves the stability of electrode material in the NCM811/graphite batteries over a wide temperature range. Current data indicate heightened capacity retention compared to standard electrolytes. PDITC showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of a wide temperature range.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% after 1400 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and from 15&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. After being stored at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79&#8201;% to 90&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 0&#8201;&#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.

         <title>Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert&#8208;Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds possessing a Quaternary Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate. While there have been many reports on enamine reactions, dienamine reactions have not been well studied. Herein, we report controlling reactivity of dienamines and molecular diversification from OAC.</dc:description>

The emission and 1O2&#160;generation of (T)CyI&#8208;NO2&#160;are quenched by the 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl group, but can be specifically switched on by bacterial NTR.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Coupling of Alcohols: Efficient Routes to Access &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Substituted Chalcones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6&#8208;OH&#8208;bpy)NiCl2. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones, and &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones via borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl&#8208;based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KOtBu or K2CO3, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of multi&#8208;luminescent silica&#8208;based nanoparticles for the detection of liquid organic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tracer testing in reservoir formations is utilised to determine residual oil saturation as part of optimum hydrocarbon production. Here, we present a novel detection method of liquid organic compounds by monodisperse SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) containing two luminophores, a EuIII:EDTA complex and a newly synthesised fluorophore based on the organic boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;moiety. The particles exhibited stable EuIII PL emission intensity with a long lifetime in aqueous dispersion. The fluorescence of the BODIPY was also preserved in the aqueous environment. The ratiometric PL detection technique was demonstrated by using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions were found to give NPs with a diameter of ~ 100 nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was confirmed to be very low for human lung cell and fish cell lines. These findings demonstrate the potential of the NPs to replace the hazardous chemicals used to estimate the residual oil saturation. Moreover, the ratiometric PL detection technique is anticipated to be of benefit in other fields, such as biotechnology, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring, where a reliable and safe detection of a liquid organic phase is needed.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxide for Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review, the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt; 0.1 M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#8216;Impossible&#8217; Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes turns out to be challenging, since their components do not have mutual recognition sites, thus complicating the assembly of the interlocked arrangement. This review highlights the importance of the development of novel synthetic strategies towards &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes by pointing out selected examples.







Abstract
&#8216;Impossible&#8217; rotaxanes, which are constituted by interlocked components without obvious binding motifs, have attracted the interest of the mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) community. Within the synthetic efforts reported in the last decades towards the preparation of MIMs, some innovative protocols for accessing &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes have been developed. This short review highlights different selected synthetic examples of &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes, as well as suggests some future directions of this research area.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfimidation in Aqueous Media: a Fast, Chemoselective and Biomolecule&#8208;Compatible Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excellent nitrene transfer reactivity of the copper complexes investigated in this study could be an interesting starting point to unlock nitrene transfer catalysis in&#8197;vivo. The copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation of thioethers in aqueous media proceeds with high chemoselectivity and good biomolecule compatibility within short reaction times, meeting the fitness factors associated with developing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions for future in&#8197;vivo application.







Abstract
Performing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in cells and living systems has equipped scientists with a toolbox to study biological processes and release drugs on demand. Thus far, an impressive scope of reactions has been performed in these settings, but many are yet to be introduced. Nitrene transfer presents a rather unexplored new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The reaction products are frequently encountered motifs in pharmaceuticals, presenting opportunities for the controlled, intracellular synthesis of drugs. Hence, we explored the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction in water for future in&#8197;vivo application. Two Cu(I) complexes containing trispyrazolylborate ligands (Tpx) were selected, and the catalytic system was evaluated with the aid of three fitness factors. The excellent nitrene transfer reactivity and high chemoselectivity of the catalysts, coupled with good biomolecule compatibility, successfully enabled the sulfimidation of thioethers in aqueous media. We envision that this copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction could be an interesting starting point to unlock the potential of nitrene transfer catalysis in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Radiolabelled 177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and assess the in&#8197;vivo performance of a nonadentate bispidine ligand for 177Lu3+ ion complexation. Photoconjugation methods to proteins including the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab produced viable 177Lu&#8208;radiotracers for targeting the human epidermal growth&#8208;factor receptor HER2 in relevant mouse models of human ovarian cancer. Bispidines are a promising scaffold for developing chelates with high denticity.







Abstract
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here, we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and in&#8197;vivo performance of a lanthanoid&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for 177Lu3+ ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+ was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Subsequent incubation of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+ with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365&#8197;nm for 15&#8197;min, at room temperature and pH&#8197;8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14&#8201;%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90&#8201;%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays in&#8197;vitro using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4&#8201;%ID g&#8722;1 vs. 14.8&#177;6.1&#8201;%ID g&#8722;1, respectively; P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.

&lt;/b&gt; with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365&#8197;nm for 15&#8197;min, at room temperature and pH&#8197;8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu]Lu-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-azepin-trastuzumab ([&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu]Lu-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-mAb) in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14&#8201;%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&amp;gt;90&#8201;%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; using the SK-OV-3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu]Lu-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/&lt;i&gt;neu&lt;/i&gt;. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK-OV-3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4&#8201;%ID g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 14.8&#177;6.1&#8201;%ID g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine-based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high-denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
As a multifunctional material, metal clusters have recently received some attention for their application in solar cells.This review delves into the multifaceted role of metal clusters in advancing solar cell technologies, covering diverse aspects from electron transport and interface modification to serving as molecular precursors for inorganic materials and acting as photosensitizers in metal&#8208;cluster sensitized solar cells (MCSSCs). The studies conducted by various researchers illustrate the crucial impact of metal clusters, such as gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), on enhancing solar cell efficiency through size&#8208;dependent effects, distinct interface behaviors, and tailored interface engineering. From optimizing charge transfer rates to improving light absorption and reducing carrier recombination, metal clusters prove instrumental in shaping the landscape of solar energy conversion.The promising performance of metal&#8208;cluster sensitized solar cells, coupled with their scalability and flexibility, positions them as a exciting avenue for future clean energy applications.

         <title>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Scavengers of Bromine Involved in Catalytic Bromination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group has been developed to retard uncatalyzed bromination reactions using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide by capturing bromine generated in situ, which was revealed to cause background reactions. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity and as a probe to investigate the involvement of Br2 in catalytic bromination. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Uraguchi, K. Asano and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303399).

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Designable and Stabilized Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of charge&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as well as recent advances form the focus of this review. The applications of these charge&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, and biological applications are highlighted, as well as prospects for future developments in this field.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a class of crystalline framework materials assembled by hydrogen bonds. HOFs have the advantages of high crystallinity, mild reaction conditions, good solution processability, and reproducibility. Coupled with the reversibility and flexibility of hydrogen bonds, HOFs can be assembled into a wide diversity of crystalline structures. Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge&#8208;assisted, ligand&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross&#8208;linking. Charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs, and introduces the different building block construction modes of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopper exchange reactions between a rotaxane building block and diamine reagents gave dramatically different outcome in solution and in solvent&#8208;free conditions. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution but the inclusion complex is preserved under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.

         <title>CBr4 as a Mild Oxidant&#8208;Enabled Oxidation of a sp3 C&#8722;H Bond: A Facile Synthesis of the Persistent Iminium Salts of Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H bond oxidation of THIQs was achieved by CBr4 initiated reaction conditions, providing a series of the persistent iminium salts of THIQs in high yields with good functional group tolerance. These iminium salts can be readily applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQ derivatives.







Abstract
Using CBr4 as a mild oxidant, the direct C&#8722;H bond oxidation of N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved, giving a series of the corresponding iminium salts in high yields under metal&#8208; and photo&#8208;free reaction conditions. This reaction is superior in high yields and good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage derivatization showed that these iminium salts can readily be applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQs.

         <title>The Phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) Ba4Li16Si3P12</title>

The new quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 contain so far unknown structural motifs with lithium in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination by phosphorus







Abstract
The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE=Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z=2) with CdI2&#8208;analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex&#8208;sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra. Ba4Li16Si3P12 forms likewise a new structure type (P21/c, Z=16) with a three&#8208;dimensional network of SiP4, Si2P6 and LiP4 entities as well as one phosphorus site not bonded to silicon. Barium is located in capped trigonal prisms of phosphorus which form strongly corrugated layers. 31P and 29Si solid&#8208;state NMR spectra confirm the crystal structures of the compounds AE2Li4SiP4. 7Li spectra show only one signal in spite of quite different crystallographic positions, which indicate possible Li+ mobility. However, this signal is much broader compared to the known Li+ conducting phosphidosilicates. Accordingly, electrochemical impedance measurements show low Li+ conductivities.

         <title>Colloidal ruthenium catalysts for selective quinaldine hydrogenation: Ligand and solvent effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal ruthenium nanoparticles are selective catalysts for heterocycle hydrogenations at room temperature. Control over activity and chemoselectivity are achieved by both changing the reaction solvent and the stabilizing ligands. The hydrogenation of the carbocycle is attained with a selectivity up to 70&#8201;% at full conversion.







Abstract
Colloidal Ru nanoparticles (NP) display interesting catalytic properties for the hydrogenation of (hetero)arenes as they proceed efficiently in mild reaction conditions. In this work, a series of Ru based materials was used in order to selectively hydrogenate quinaldine and assess the impact of the stabilizing agent on their catalytic performances. Ru nanoparticles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 1&#8208;adamantanecarboxylic acid (AdCOOH) allowed to obtain 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine with a remarkable selectivity in mild reaction conditions by choosing the suitable solvent. The presence of a carboxylate ligand on the surface of the Ru NP led to an increase in the activity when compared to Ru/PVP catalyst. The stabilizing agent had also an impact on the selectivity, as carboxylate ligand modified catalysts promoted the selectivity towards 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine, with bulky carboxylate displaying the highest ones.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCoO3 perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high capacitance property and stable long&#8208;term cycle life, and can be used as a wide temperature&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor with a withstand temperature range of 25~85&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature&#8208;tolerance.







Abstract
Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance. In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x=0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91&#8197;C g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1@775.09&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7&#8201;% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;Substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fascinating and intricate bonding scenario is found within a biradicaloid chromium complex. The ligand&#8242;s bonding atoms are depicted as doors, clearly marked with C and P. The arrows on the doors highlight the biradicaloid nature at the P atoms. The bonding interactions are portrayed as a staircase, symbolizing the connection between the biradicaloid and the metal. Like the individuals walking in opposite directions on the steps, the electrons flow in both directions: from the ligand to the metal and vice versa.

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical characterization of a pH&#8208;sensitive quadracyclic uridine (qU) analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Polar Crystals, Second Harmonic Generation, and Piezoelectric Effects from Heteroadamantanes in the Space Group R3m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar crystalline materials, a subset of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, are highly sought after. Their symmetry properties make them pyroelectric and also piezoelectric and capable of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). For SHG and piezoelectric applications, metal oxides are commonly used. The advantages of oxides are durability and hardness &#8211; downsides are the need for high&#8208;temperature synthesis/processing and often the need to include toxic metals. Organic polar crystals, on the other hand, can avoid toxic metals and can be amenable to solution&#8208;state processing. While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non&#8208;polar space groups, we found that both 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantane, for short Cl&#8208;TAA, and also the related Br&#8208;TAA (but not I&#8208;TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl&#8208;TAA and Br&#8208;TAA. When the two species are crystallized together, solid solutions form, suggesting that properties of future materials can be tuned continuously.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Switchable Sensors for Hydroxide on Glass Surfaces Based on Isoquinolinium&#8208;Quinolinium&#8208;substituted&#160; Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes with a quinolinium and an &#160;isoquinolinium substituent are described, which reversibly form intensely colored adducts with O&#8208;nucleophiles and thus enable the detection of &gt;0,5 ppm hydroxide on the surfaces of various glasses. Acids reconstitute the colorless bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes. The quinolinium and isoquinolinium rings are bound via their 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208; and 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208;positions to the triple bond, respectively. The choice of substitution sites of the hetarenium rings enables the design of mixed conjugated/cross&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;electron systems. Depending on the combination of binding sites, the frontier orbital profile, the triple bond polarization, the fluorescence behaviour, and the sensitivity to hydroxide differs.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of GanodermaMeroterpenoids Cochlearol B and Its Congeners Driven by Structural Similarity and Biological Homology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary metabolites that have the same biological origin must share some relationship in their biosynthesis. Exploring this relationship has always been a significant task for synthetic biologists. However, from the perspective of synthetic chemists, it is equally important to propose, prove, or refute potential biosynthetic pathways in order to elucidate and understand the biosynthesis of homologous secondary metabolites. In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The aim was to reveal their potential biosynthetic conversion relationship using chemical synthesis methods. As a result, a highly efficient total synthesis of cochlearol B, cochlearol T, cochlearol F, as well as the formal total synthesis of ganocins A&#8208;B, and ganocochlearins C&#8208;D, has been achieved. Additionally, a novel synthetic approach for the synthesis of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;dibenzo[b,d]pyran and its analogues has been developed through palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type/cross coupling cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Photochemical Preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) Composite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents a one&#8208;step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) composite&#160;photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV&#8208;light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na2S2O3, CdSO4, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen&#8208;containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one&#8208;step construction strategy relying only on photo&#8208;energy is green, low&#8208;cost and promising in obtaining high&#8208;performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylimidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted Nitronyl Nitroxides and Their Mononuclear Cu(II) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure and Magnetic Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
This work reports a selective method for the synthesis of N&#8208;alkylimidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides in high yields. And also, a new family of molecular heterospin complexes was obtained by the reaction of new nitroxides and Cu(hfac)2.







Abstract
A novel synthetic approach has been employed to synthesize a series of new nitronyl nitroxides: 2&#8208;(1&#8208;propyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Ln&#8722;Pr), 2&#8208;(1&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Li&#8722;Pr) and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;oxide&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (Ln&#8722;Bu). The reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with LR in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio yields mononuclear heterospin complexes [Cu(hfac)2(LR)2] (LR=Ln&#8208;Pr, Li&#8208;Pr, Ln&#8208;Bu), which have a similar crystal structure to the &#8220;jumping&#8221; crystals [Cu(hfac)2(LMe)2] that exhibit chemomechanical activity. It was shown that an increase in the alkyl substituent R leads to changes in the crystal packing of the molecules and the absence of chemomechanical activity. Furthermore, it was found that two polymorph modifications of the heterospin complex [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8722;Pr)2] can be obtained, and magnetic properties of [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8722;Pr)2] strongly depend on the angle between the planes of the paramagnetic fragment O&#8226;&#8211;N&#8208;C=N&#8594;O and the imidazole ring in Ln&#8722;Pr.

         <title>&#8220;Buttressing Effect&#8221; in the Halogen&#8208;Lithium Exchange in ortho&#8208;Bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines and Related Naphthalenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums is presented. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, the impact on regioselectivity of the reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions such as coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and steric repulsion of substituents strongly affect the halogen&#8208;lithium exchange process. Here we present the manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums. The increase of the size of the &#8220;buttressing&#8221; substituent strongly affects the conformation of a NMe2 group, forcing it to hinder ortho&#8208;bromine and thus slowing down the exchange. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, this suppresses regioselectivity of the reaction. The &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; forces formed aryllithiums to deaggregate, thus boosting their reactivity. This facilitates the decomposition via protolisys by ethereal solvents even at low temperatures and in some cases initiates fast Wurtz&#8208;Fittig coupling.

         <title>Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates selective hydrogenation of nitriles to produce primary amines using a well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline nickel carbide (nano&#8208;Ni3C) catalyst. The aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) showed high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope, with various (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic nitriles affording the corresponding primary amines, even under 1&#8197;bar of H2.







Abstract
Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.

         <title>Giant Star&#8208;shaped meso&#8208;substituted Fluorescent Porphyrins with Fluorenyl&#8208;containing Arms Designed for Two&#8208;photon Oxygen Photosensitization</title>

New Starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units have been synthesized. Their detailed oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption properties are discussed







Abstract
In the continuation of previous studies on carbon&#8208;rich meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins featuring 2,7&#8208;fluorene units at their periphery, the effect of changing the peripheral dendritic arms for linear arms on their oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties is now analyzed. Thus, starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units were isolated and studied. More precisely, a series of five new free&#8208;base porphyrins featuring fully conjugated arms incorporating an increasing number of fluorenyl groups connected via 1,2&#8208;alkenyl spacers were synthesized, along with their Zn(II) complexes. Upon excitation in the arm&#8208;centred &#960;&#8208;&#960;* absorption band, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the peripheral fluorenyl units to the central porphyrin core, leading to intense red&#8208;light emission and oxygen photosensitization by the latter. More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy (PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross&#8208;sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi&#8208;disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade&#8208;off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.

More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross-sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin-based two-photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi-disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade-off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;Based Molecular Switches Tethered by Four&#8208;Arm Star&#8208;like Polymers</title>

Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;based molecular switches tethered by four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) show slower dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhanced photoluminescence and thermally accessible triplets in solid states.







Abstract
Molecular switches that reversibly change their structures and physical properties are important for applications such as sensing and information processing at molecular scales. In order to avoid the intermolecular aggregation that is often detrimental to the stimuli&#8208;responses of molecular switches, previous studies of molecular switches have been often conducted in dilute solutions which are difficult for applications in solid&#8208;state devices. Here we report molecular design and synthesis that integrates anthraquinodimethane as molecular switching units into polymers with amenable processibility in solid states. Optical and electron spin resonance characterizations indicate that the four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) tethered from anthraquinodimethane slow down the dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhance the photoluminescence in solid states and impart materials with a small energy gap from singlet ground state to thermally accessible triplet state.

         <title>Synthesis of Bench&#8208;stable Polycyclic Organophosphorus Heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type Annulations of ortho&#8208;Azidophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most penta&#8208;coordinated organophosphorus compounds are not bench&#8208;stable. To stabilize penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) species, phosphorus&#8208;containing polycyclic structures have been introduced. Herein, we report two novel bench&#8208;stable polycyclic P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP), that can be prepared via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations of ortho&#8208;azidophenols with either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters.







Abstract
The formation of a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring is known to stabilize unstable molecular structures such as hemiacetals. This idea can also be extended to stabilize other high&#8208;coordinated p&#8208;block element species. Herein, we synthesized two novel polycyclic organophosphorus heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations. Reactions of either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides 1 or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters 4 with ortho&#8208;azidophenols 2 gave rise to penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) 3 and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP) 5 in satisfactory yields. It is remarkable that heterocycles 3 and 5 are both bench&#8208;stable and exhibit considerable stability in a 10&#8201;% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Preliminary computational studies disclosed that the formation of nitrogen gas is the key driving force for the annulations. In addition, the formation of a strong Si&#8722;F bond is another contributor to the annulation of 1 and 2.

         <title>Probing oxygen exchange between UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF and water using 17O solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 17O labeled terephtalic acid ligand has been used for the synthesis of 17O enriched UiO&#8208;66 compound. High&#8208;field 17O solid&#8208;state NMR experiments show an overall transfer of oxygen in the structure.







Abstract
The Zr&#8208;based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66(Zr) is widely employed owing to its good thermal and chemical stabilities. Although the long&#8208;range structure of this MOF is preserved in the presence of water during several days, little is known about the formation of defects, which cannot be detected using diffraction techniques. We apply here 17O solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 18.8&#8197;T to investigate the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66, through the exchange of oxygen atoms between the different sites of the MOF and water. For that purpose, we have selectively enriched in 17O isotope the carboxylate groups of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by using it with 17O&#8208;labeled terephthalic acid prepared using mechanochemistry. In the presence of water at 50&#8201;&#176;C and a following dehydration at 150&#8201;&#176;C, we observe an overall exchange of O atoms between COO&#8722; and &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three distinct oxygen sites, &#956;3&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; and COO&#8722;, of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF can be enriched in 17O isotope by post&#8208;synthetic hydrothermal treatment in the presence of 17O&#8208;enriched water. These results demonstrate the lability of Zr&#8722;O bonds and the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) with water.

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOFs) was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method, which is firstly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and exhibits well cyclic stability. The synthesis of 2D MOFs can well inhibit the dissolution of anthraquinone electrode in the organic electrolyte.







Abstract
Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance of anthraquinone and the high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of the anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ion into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.

         <title>Enhanced Orientation of Liquid Crystals Inside Micropores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Having Thermoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite material LC@MOF was synthesized by incorporating liquid crystals (LCs) into the pores of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The LCs were aligned within the pores of the MOFs, even when heated beyond their isotropic phase transition temperature. As the temperature changed, the LCs underwent a change in orientation, resulting in a thermoresponsive birefringence. The LC@MOF is a novel type useful stimuli&#8208;responsive material with potential applications in various fields.







Abstract
With the aim of controlling the orientation of liquid crystals (LCs) toward realizing external stimuli&#8211;responsive materials with tunable functionalities, we synthesized a composite of LCs and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by filling LCs into the pores of MOFs (LC@MOFs) for the first time. The included LCs interact with the MOFs through coordination bonds between the cyano groups of the LCs and the metal ions of the MOFs, enabling the orientation of the LC molecules inside the pores of the MOFs and the realization of birefringence of LC@MOFs. The three&#8208;dimensional nanometer interstice frameworks maintained the LC orientation even at temperatures much higher than the isotropic phase transition temperature of bulk LCs. Furthermore, the orientational state changed upon heating or cooling, inducing temperature&#8208;dependent birefringence. This study provides a new approach to the development of stimuli&#8211;responsive optical materials and stimuli&#8211;responsive MOFs.

         <title>Enhancing Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs), with their unique combination of high ionic conductivity, oxygen solubility, low volatility, and customizable chemical characteristics, serve as versatile tools to enhance various PEMFC components, from membranes and catalysts to electrodes.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, including proton conductivity, catalyst stability, and fuel crossover, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes by serving as an effective stabilizer to promote the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Direct Arylation of Distyrylbenzene: Strong Dual&#8208;state Fluorescence and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distyrylbenzenes (DSBs) are well&#8208;known for their strong multicolour fluorescence. Fluorescence tuning of DSB via further functionalization/arylation, on the other hand, is uncommon. This paper reports a Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach for introducing different aryl groups onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety (7) in high yields (67&#8208;72%). The versatile methodology allows the substitution of neutral, electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl groups. The electron&#8208;deficient aryls render mono&#8208;substitution, while the electron&#8208;rich counterparts promote di&#8208;substitution. The compounds (1&#8208;6) show blue, green, and yellow fluorescence in both the solution and solid states; the fluorescence quantum yields reach 100% and the peak maxima span from 425 to 560 nm. The mono&#8208;carbazole DSB(5) exhibit white light emission(WLM) in polar solvents (acetone, DMF, CH3CN, DMSO and NMP) with very high fluorescence quantum yields(&#981;f) of 60&#8208;80%. For WLM, such high efficiency (&#981;f) is somewhat uncommon. Moreover, visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism is demonstrated by the TPA&#8208;integrated DSB(6). The colour of 6 changes from pristine light yellow to orange, and the absorption maxima shifts from 372 to 1500 nm when a positive potential of 1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ is applied. Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98s and 1.05s.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol has been developed to access diverse monosubstituted cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) from the readily available azolium salts and phenacyl bromides via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization. This atom&#8208;economic protocol executes a range of intermediate steps e.g. double C&#8208;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of H2O as the sole byproduct. Moreover, the systematic tunability of photo&#8208;physical and electrochemical properties of these new class of cPHACs can be authenticated from the DFT calculated frontier molecular orbital energies that might be beneficial for their potential applications in optoelectronics and DNA intercalation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8211; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluorosulfanyl group has been proposed as a valuable addition to the toolbox of organofluorine chemistry. Here, we introduce commercially available (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene sulfur pentafluoride (TASP) as a versatile reagent that provides very low&#8208;risk access to the elusive class of &#945;&#8208;SF5 aldehyde enamines under benchtop conditions. This approach allowed these precious building blocks to be accessed and fully characterized for the first time.







Abstract
Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8197;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8722;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.

         <title>A Rational Design of Electrochemically and Photophysically Tunable Triarylamine Luminophores by Consecutive (Pseudo&#8209;)Four&#8208;Component Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concatenation of Suzuki coupling and two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in sequentially palladium&#8208;catalyzed consecutive multicomponent syntheses paves a concise, convergent route to diversely functionalized para&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (p&#8208;bTAAs) from simple, readily available starting materials. An extensive library of p&#8208;bTAAs permits comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations, which contribute to a deep understanding of their electronic structure. The synthesized p&#8208;bTAAs exhibit tunable fluorescence from blue to yellow upon photonic excitation with quantum yields up to 98% in solution and 92% in the solid state. Furthermore, a pronounced bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by increasing solvent polarity indicates positive emission solvatochromism. Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixtures causes the formation of intensely blue fluorescent aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible first and second oxidations of p&#8208;bTAAs at low potentials, which are tunable by variation of the introduced para substituents. 3D Hammett plots resulting from the correlation of oxidation potentials and emission maxima with electronic substituent parameters emphasize the rational design of tailored p&#8208;bTAAs with predictable electrochemical and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>

         <dc:description>In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;lactam ring in classical &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics by an N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2&#8208;(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3&#8208;diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re&#8208;addition to a putative six&#8208;membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm.

         <title>Boosting Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes via Dispersion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species require a tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. This time&#8208;consuming process is often case&#8208;specific and requires an iteration for each new method. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8208;20 equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8208;30 mol%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Morphology Evolution and Function Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the morphology evolution, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and potential application of liquid crystalline (LC) nanoassemblies by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly(PISA). Under the regulation of LC ordering and PISA process, LC nanoassemblies showed abundant morphologies and specific formation evolution. According to the LC mesogen, the studies were divided into fluoro&#8208;containing, azobenzene, poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) and others to be introduced respectively.







Abstract
Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind of polymer NPs with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks, LC NPs show abundant morphology evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have great application potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at high solid content, reducing the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC polymers, being a better choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the LC mesogen, and discussed the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these polymers.

         <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Magnetic Hardness by Modulating Antagonistic Interactions in the Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Free Magnetic Solid Solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2</title>

Experimental and computational investigations of the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 show that modulating antagonistic magnetic interactions enables the realization of permanent magnets at room temperature.







Abstract
The quinary members in the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 (x=1&#8211;4, VE=63&#8211;66) have been investigated experimentally and computationally. They were synthesized via arc&#8208;melting and analyzed by EDX and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted a preference for magnetic ordering in all members, but with a strong competition between ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetism arising from interchain Fe&#8722;Fe interactions. The spin exchange and magnetic anisotropy energies predicted the lowest magnetic hardness for x=1 and 3 and the highest for x=2. Magnetization measurements confirm the DFT predictions and demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN=55&#8211;70&#8197;K) found at low magnetic fields changed to ferromagnetic (TC=150&#8211;750&#8197;K) at higher fields, suggesting metamagnetic behavior for all samples. As predicted, Hf2FeRu3Ir2B2 has the highest intrinsic coercivity (Hc=74&#8197;kA/m) reported to date for Ti3Co5B2&#8208;type phases. Furthermore, all coercivities outperform that of ferromagnetic Hf2FeIr5B2, indicating the importance of AFM interactions in enhancing magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Importantly, two members (x=1 and 4) maintain intrinsic coercivities in the semi&#8208;hard range at room temperature. This study opens an avenue for controlling magnetic hardness by modulating antagonistic AFM and FM interactions in low&#8208;dimensional rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free magnetic materials.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

         <title>The Impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) Complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;Depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines reveal remarkable bonding preference in linear bis&#8208;coordinate silver(I) and halogen(I) complexes investigated in 15&#8197;N NMR solution spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8722;X&#8722;N]+ (X=I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8722;291 and &#8722;351&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and for bromine between &#8722;370 and &#8722;427 kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66&#8208;76&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.

         <title>Mn(III) O^N^O Complexes as Water&#8208;tolerant and Environmentally Benign Catalysts for Polyurethane Foam Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicaldimine&#8208;based O^N^O&#8208;pincer complexes of Mn(III) and Fe(III) serve as excellent, environmentally benign catalysts for the preparation of polyurethane foams. These compounds show high activities, stability in aqueous environments and are non&#8208;volatile, and are therefore suitable alternatives to Sn&#8208; or amine&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co&#8208;ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square&#8208;planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit the simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.

However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer-ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co-ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square-planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit the simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photopharmacology of Protease Inhibitors: Current Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths vary from ~83 to ~123 kcal mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Influence on Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Aromaticity and Activation Strain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The factors governing 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving C[[EQUATION]]P&#8208;containing compounds are computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the parent process involving tBuN3 and tBuCP is analyzed and compared to the analogous reaction involving organometallic cyaphide complexes (metal = Ag, Pt, Ge, Mg), in order to understand the role of the metal fragment in such transformations. It is found that while the metal fragment does not significantly influence the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states or the regioselectivity of the transformation, it may modify the reactivity of the cyaphide complexes (i.e. Ge and Mg cyaphide complexes are comparatively more reactive). The computed reactivity trends and the factors behind the regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction are quantitatively analyzed with the help of the activation strain model in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R = Me, 1; R = H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54 nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50 nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of 2&#8208;Pyridone Fluorophores for Brighter Emissions at Longer Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs = 377 nm; &#955;em = 433 nm; &#949; = 13,200 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1; &#632;F = 88%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#949; = 20,100 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em = 539 nm), high emission quantum yield (&#632;F = 74%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v = 5720 cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical&#160; fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33 PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa &gt; E. coli &gt; A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase through the Synergy of Tunnel Engineering, Evolutionary Analysis, and Force&#8208;Field Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational design advances enzyme evolution and their use in biocatalysis in a faster and more efficient manner. In this study, a synergistic approach integrating tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force&#8208;field calculations has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase (D&#8208;Lac), which is a pivotal enzyme involved in the resolution of racemic pantolactone during the production of vitamin B5. The best mutant, N96S/A271E/F274Y/F308G (M3), was obtained and its catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was nearly 23&#8208;fold higher than that of the wild&#8208;type. The M3 whole&#8208;cell converted 20% of DL&#8208;pantolactone into D&#8208;pantoic acid (D&#8208;PA, &gt;99% e.e.) with a conversion rate of 47% and&#160;space&#8208;time&#160;yield&#160;of&#160;107.1&#160;g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, demonstrating its great potential for industrial&#8208;scale D&#8208;pantothenic acid production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the reduction in the steric hindrance within the substrate tunnel and conformational reconstruction of the distal loop resulted in a more favourable"catalytic" conformation, making it easier for the substrate and enzyme to enter their pre&#8208;reaction state. This study illustrates the potential of the distal residue on the pivotal loop at the entrance of the D&#8208;Lac substrate tunnel as a novel modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and consequently influencing the enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cystobacamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit a&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#181;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing&#160;  cell compatibility  as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Flowmicro In&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. Jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#224;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens extremely challenging.&#160; So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented and elegant synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and highly regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeed the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The obtained, torus&#8208;like nanoparticles carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes simultaneously. The nanoparticles exhibited notable silencing efficiency in vitro in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC&#8208;1 toward EGFR and c&#8208;Myc genes at the mRNA level, and a significant efficiency at the protein level. The proposed approach may be an attractive alternative to methods currently used, including one therapeutic nucleic acid, one genetic target, or use of cocktails of therapeutic nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively transport and removal of fluoride ion by pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088 mmol&#8226;L&#8208;1&#8226;min&#8208;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials</dc:description>

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for the Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several ortho&#8208;carboranes bearing a phenoxy or a phenylamino group in the B9 position were prepared employing various protection and deprotection strategies. Following established protocols, dendritic compounds were synthesized from a hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or thiophosphoryl chloride core, and possible anchoring options for the B9&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;carboranes were investigated experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Furthermore, 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carborane derivatives were obtained. The resulting diethyl&#8208;, diisopropyl&#8208;, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;, diphenyl&#8208; or diethoxyphosphines bearing a tunable ortho&#8208;carborane moiety are intriguing ligands for future applications in homogeneous catalysis or the medicinal sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Thiophene&#8209;Bridged Macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic molecules possessing high quantum yields, circular dichroism, and circularly polarized luminescence values have great potential as optically active materials for future applications. Recently, the identification of a promising class of inherently chiral compounds was reported, namely macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta[2.2]paracyclophanes, displaying high circular dichroism and related gabs values albeit modest quantum yields. Increasing the quantum yields in an attempt to get bright circularly polarized light emitters, the high&#8208;yielding heterocyclization of those 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridges resulting in macrocyclic 2,5&#8208;thienyls linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes is herein described. The chiroptical properties of both, the previously reported 1,3&#8208;butadiyne, and the novel 2,5&#8208;thienyl bridged macrocycles of various sizes, are experimentally recorded, and theoretically described using density&#8208;functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalization of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.</dc:description>
