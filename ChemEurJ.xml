         <title>Glycosyl Radical&#8208;Based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;Selective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides from Glycals Enabled by Photoredox PCET/Nickel&#8208;Dual Catalysis</title>

We report a glycosyl radical&#8208;based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;sugars (DASs) from glycals via photoredox PCET/Ni dual catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycosyl radical formation involves the generation of an N&#8208;radical through a PCET process, followed by its addition to the glycal. This protocol features: a) the use of an inexpensive organic photosensitizer and readily available glycals and aryl bromides; b) good functional group tolerance for both aryl bromides and glycal substrates; c) excellent diastereoselectivity, with exclusive formation of the 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;glycosides in all cases. Furthermore, the reaction could be conducted on gram&#8208;scale and is suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecule.

         <title>Fe3+ and H+&#8208;triggered &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; Fluorescence Probe Based on Lysosomal&#8208;targeted RBH&#8208;EdC for Monitoring Intragastric Acidity</title>

Fe3+&#160;and H+&#160;triggered the ring opening of the spirolactam in Rhodamine moiety and &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; lysosomal&#8208;targeted fluorescence probe. It can be used for Fe3+&#160;detection, the response of the pH microenvironment in lysosomes, and monitoring intragastric acidity.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term visualization of intracellular Fe3+ dynamics and lysosomal activity is crucial for investigating the physiological roles and functions of lysosomes during the growth of organisms. The lysosome&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe (RBH&#8208;EdC), derived from rhodamine&#8208;nucleoside conjugates, demonstrates a sophisticated dual&#8208;activation design: one is Fe3&#8314; response, triggering spirolactam ring&#8208;opening to form xanthine structures, resulting in&#160;&#8805;&#160;1000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with visible colorimetric transition (colorless&#8594;pink). Another is pH sensitivity, demonstrating protonation&#8208;dependent fluorescence amplification at the dC at site N3 (pKa&#160;=&#160;2.9), achieving a 30&#8208;fold intensity increase at pH 2.5 within the 1.0&#8211;5.0 range. Remarkably, the RBH&#8208;EdC/Fe3&#8314; complex showed a further significant 20&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 3.0. This Fe3&#8314;/H&#8314; co&#8208;activated &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; system provides exceptional signal amplification for both in vitro and in vivo applications, enabling precise exploration of lysosome&#8208;related biological processes, including the response of the pH microenvironment, real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomal pH dynamics, in situ measurement of gastric acidity levels, and potential application in gastric ulcer diagnostics.

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Asymmetric Cyclic Dimers for Polyester&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in regioselective ROP of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s for synthesizing polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers. It covers catalyst optimization, mechanistic insights, regioselectivity quantification, and structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers. The challenges and future directions toward chemical circularity are also discussed.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers have attracted significant interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, closed&#8208;loop recyclability, and hydrolytic degradability, offering broad potential in biomedical and sustainable materials. Among the available strategies, regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s has emerged as a promising approach for constructing alternating copolymers with precise sequence&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control, structural diversity, and tunable properties. This review classifies asymmetric cyclic monomers into two categories: (1) monomers with two aliphatic ester bonds, where regioselectivity is mainly dictated by steric differences and typically requires tailored metal catalysts; and (2) monomers with chemically distinct reactive sites (e.g., phenolic ester, thioester, or amide vs. aliphatic ester), which enable near&#8208;perfect regioselectivity using simple catalysts. Recent progress in the synthesis of alternating aliphatic copolyesters, poly(phenolic&#8208;alt&#8208;aliphatic ester)s, poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;thioester)s, and poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;amide)s is highlighted, emphasizing their enhanced degradability, recyclability, and mechanical performance. Key advances in catalyst optimization, mechanistic understanding, quantification of regioselectivity, and the structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers are summarized. Finally, future directions are discussed, including rational catalyst design, expansion to new monomer architectures, and the systematic evaluation of how regioselectivity governs alternating copolymer properties.

         <title>Coronene Bisimide as a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coronene bisimide (CBI) with its efficient intersystem crossing&#160;was used as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizer. Different reactions, including cycloadditions and oxidations, were demonstrated via triplet&#8208;energy transfer from CBI.








Abstract
Photosensitization has emerged as a versatile tool to facilitate access to excited states under mild conditions, allowing for efficient and selective photochemical transformations. Herein, we report a very simple molecule, coronene bisimide (CBI), as a potent visible&#8208;light photosensitizer featuring a high extinction coefficient with a broadband absorption spanning from ultraviolet to green region of the visible spectrum, along with a long&#8208;lived triplet state generated via efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Utilizing the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTEnT) strategy, CBI catalyzes diverse reactions under green light irradiation. Through this, we propose CBIs as a new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free visible&#8208;light sensitizers overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitizers, such as low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, short triplet&#8208;state lifetimes, and high toxicity, by relying on heavy atoms.

Abstract
The coordination chemistry of the planar, doubly &#960;&#8208;extended bipyridine analog, 6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;biphenanthridine (p&#8208;biphe), is presented. The phenanthridine units in p&#8208;biphe are fused together at the 6&#8208; and 7&#8208; positions, and the resulting rigid ligand is compared with the more flexible parent &#8220;biphe&#8221; fused only at the 6&#8208;positions. p&#8208;Biphe is intensely fluorescent in solution with a much higher quantum yield, but, unlike biphe, at 77&#160;K the fluorescence is not accompanied by any significant phosphorescence. Two four&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes and pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes are described: [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+, [(P^P)Cu(p&#8208;biphe)]+, [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, and [Ir(ppy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]+, isolated as PF6 salts (P^P&#160; = &#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene; bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine). The complexes are strongly coloured due to intense low&#8208;energy absorption to charge&#8208;transfer excited states based on TDDFT calculations. The acceptor nature of the p&#8208;biphe ligand is clear from multiple reduction events observed electrochemically. The Ir(III) complex displays remarkably low&#8208;energy phosphorescence (&#955;max = 812&#160;nm) in solution at room temperature with a vibrational progression evident extending into the near IR, with no contamination from visible light emission. While the heteroleptic Cu(I) complex is phosphorescent at 77&#160;K, no emission is detectable from [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+ or [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, likely due to competitive nonradiative decay.

         <title>Rational Design and Mechanistic Insights Into Transition Metal&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Modulated Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous theories have been widely applied to explain the enhanced OER activity, the mechanism involving spin configurations that tune the OER process remains unclear. This short review highlights some recent advances in understanding spin&#8208;modulated oxygen evolution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts and provides insights into the fundamentals of the spin effect and design strategies for spin&#8208;modulated OER catalysts.








Abstract
Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between the singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and the triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In the last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ Complex in Cuproptosis</title>

EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) evidence uncovers direct ET (electron transfer) and high specificity between FDX1 (ferredoxin 1) and the ES&#8208;Cu2+ (Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+) complex.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of cell death processes. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES&#8208;Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.

         <title>Impact of Oxygen and Sulfur Heteroatom Core Substitution on Catalyst Properties of Phenoxazines and Their Performance in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP)</title>

Phenoxazine core structural modification reveals the impact of charge transfer on stronger excited state reduction potentials. We observed that modifying the core of a photocatalyst that does not exhibit charge transfer yields a highly reducing singlet excited state reduction potential compared to a charge transfer equivalent.








Abstract
Phenoxazines are a successful class of organic photoredox catalysts (PCs) with tunable redox and photophysical properties. Originally, we aimed to realize more reducing phenoxazine PCs through heteroatom core substituted (HetCS) derivatives, while maintaining an efficiently oxidizing PC&#183;+. However, core modification with thioether or ether functionality to a PC that exhibits photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (CT) negligibly alters the singlet excited state reduction potential (ES1&#176;*), while yielding a less oxidizing PC&#183;+ (E1/2) (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.50&#8211;0.64&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to the noncore modified PC 1 (0.68&#160;V vs. SCE). Photophysical characterization of HetCS PCs revealed that increasing electron density on the core of a CT exhibiting PC stabilizes the emissive state and PC&#183;+, resulting in a relatively unchanged ES1&#176;* compared to PC 1. In contrast, modifying the core of a PC that does not exhibit CT yields a highly reducing ES1&#176;* (PC 3 = &#8722;2.48&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to its CT equivalent (PC 1d = &#8722;1.68&#160;V vs. SCE). The impact of PC property on photocatalytic ability was evaluated through organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). HetCS PCs were able to yield poly(methyl methacrylate) with low dispersity and moderate targeted molecular weight as evaluated by initiator efficiency (I*) in DMAc (&#208; = 1.20&#8211;1.26; I* = 47&#8211;57%). Ultimately, this work provides insight into how phenoxazine PC properties are altered through structural modification, which can inform future PC design.

         <title>Hierarchical MnO2 Nanoflowers and SnO2 Nanoparticles on Rhombohedral LaMnO3 for 2&#160;V Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric 2&#160;V aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using LaMnO3/MnO2 nanoflower hierarchical electrodes prepared using a simple direct chemical synthesis method exhibits superior performance over bare LaMnO3 and MnO2 electrodes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the effective Mn3+/Mn4+ redox transitions, improved interfacial charge transport, and synergistic interactions enabled by the hierarchical architecture.








Abstract
The strategy of forming hierarchical nanostructures of electroactive materials has shown enhancements in supercapacitor performances. In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO2 nanoflowers and SnO2 nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO3 nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO3 electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO3/MnO2 shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO3/MnO2 electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO3. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO2 and LaMnO3. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&#8722;1 (32 F g&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&#8722;1 at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&#8722;1. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation With Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an alternative new type of spontaneous moisture electricity generator, a recyclable polyelectrolyte film was developed by the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of LA and polyelectrolyte HA, with an azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid. This film can absorb ambient moisture and induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow, thereby enabling electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals.








Abstract
Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step toward sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;1.5&#160;cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6&#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.

         <title>Dual Excitation and Dual Emission in a 1,4&#8208;Diazepine Bearing an Extended &#960;&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodehydrogenation of a previously reported nanographene BDI leads to the formation of a 1,4&#8208;diazepine via scandium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond formation. This compound exhibits a unique combination of dual excitation and dual emission. The dual emission was found to be caused by a combination of charge transfer and geometric relaxation in the excited state.








Abstract
We present the synthesis of a benzo[b]benzo[11,12]tetracene[5,6&#8208;ef][1,4]diazepine (BBTDZ) and a benzo[g]phenanthro[9,10,1&#8208;cde]indazolium (BPIZ), two novel N&#8208;heterocyclic nanographenes. Both molecules were independently isolated from 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation reaction of the previously reported benzo[f,g]tetracene &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BT&#8208;BDI). Our mechanistic investigation shows the instrumental role of Sc(OTf)3 in allowing for C&#9472;N bond formation over N&#9472;N bond formation. Unexpectedly, the BBTDZ compound shows unique dual emission and dual excitation (DE/DE) properties. A combination of spectroscopic and computational studies provides a rationalization of these features. Charge transfer followed by geometric relaxation were found to cause the dual, strongly red&#8208;shifted emission. The understanding of both the reaction mechanism and mechanism of DE/DE can contribute to the rational design of materials with unique photophysical properties.

A series of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based BAEs and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot from the substrates containing boronic ester groups and 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or similar derivatives.








Abstract
A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme, 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of the reaction substrates, which could undergo a tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.

Barium oxide forms unique structures under pressure because of Ba&#8212;O bonding through the 5d orbitals. DFT bonding analysis shows that these bonds outweigh electrostatic interactions in BaO, but not CaO or SrO.

The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8 &#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8211;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II&#160;chemistry.

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive liquid crystals can be obtained by doping with molecular photoswitches. Photoisomerization results in a fast and reversible transition between the&#160;nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid phase. Simultaneous doping with two orthogonal photoswitches enables optical manipulation of the liquid crystal using selected wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared light.








Abstract
Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright birefringent or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a noninvasive external stimulus.

         <title>A Family of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Aza&#8208;Dipyrromethenes and Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Through&#8208;Bond and Face&#8208;To&#8208;Face &#960;&#8208;Interaction between Termini</title>

         <dc:description>
The reported aza&#8208;dibenzodiprromethenes present a rare helical architecture, placing terminal aryl groups in a close, &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement. Differentially terminated derivatives are prepared by statistical condensation or controlled synthesis via conversion of one partner to its tosylate or triflate. Borylation (BF3) is significantly improved by addition of TMS&#8208;Cl; an important protocol change that could improve general BODIPY syntheses. The alkene stereochemistry switches in the formed aza&#8208;BODIPYs, separating the termini.








Abstract
The dipyrromethenes (DPMs) and their borylated adducts (BODIPYs) constitute a class of versatile chromophores that has become one of the most widely studied over recent decades. They combine excellent photochemistry properties with opportunity for synthetic manipulation and tuning. We report here a related class of aza&#8208;dibenzodipyrromethenes and show that they present an interesting architecture where the core adopts a helical arrangement that places terminal aryl functional groups directly on top of each other in close, &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement. Complexation by reaction with boron trifluoride, demonstrated to be significantly improved by addition of trimethylsilyl chloride, induces a stereochemical inversion that destroys the helix, flattens the system, and switches on fluorescence. A wide range of terminal aromatic fragments can be easily introduced. Unsymmetrical derivatives can be made conveniently by simple mixed condensations, but a controlled, rational approach is also described whereby the ability of one component to homocondense (the more reactive partner) is removed by conversion to its corresponding tosylate or triflate. The two approaches have been investigated through successful introduction of complementary electron rich, electron poor, and &#960;&#8208;extended functional termini.

         <title>A Convergent Radical Cascade for the Synthesis of Azaindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach for synthesising diverse azaindanes through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cyclisation is explored. Using Katritzky salts and alkenes, this method tolerates various functional groups and does not require the addition of oxidants or photocatalysts. The exploration of a broad scope enable the definition of the requirements for a successful process. Additionally, the roles of the acid additive and the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product are investigated.








Abstract
The azaindane motif is present in a number of drug candidates and combines the benefits of both a high sp3&#8208;fraction and an heteroaromatic ring. However, only a limited number of efficient approaches for the elaboration of this motif have been reported, and very few are flexible enough to enable the fast generation of analogues. Here we report the exploration of a convergent process for the construction of a variety of azaindanes and related semi&#8208;saturated fused heterocycles from an heteroaromatic triphenylpyridinium (Katritzky Salt) and an alkene coupling partner. In this process, two new C&#9472;C bonds are formed in a single step involving the activation of a pyridine&#8208;containing Katritzky salt under visible light irradiation in acidic conditions without the use of additional reductant/oxidant or photocatalyst. Under these operationally simple conditions, a variety of functional groups are tolerated, but the outcome of the reaction is dependent on the electronic nature of the pendant heterocycle and the alkene reaction partner. To help the exploration of future substrates, guidelines are established to predict the outcome of the reaction. Additionally, mechanistic studies shed light on the role played by the acid additive as well as the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product in this process.

         <title>Aromatic Wall Extension of Glycoluril&#8208;Derived Molecular Clips Enhances Binding of Planar Aromatic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the length of the aromatic walls of methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril&#8208;dimer&#8208;derived molecular clips on their binding affinity toward a panel of planar aromatic cations is reported. We find that anthracene&#8208;walled host H2 generally binds&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold stronger to a specific guest than naphthalene&#8208;walled H1.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a new methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril dimer featuring anthracene walls (H2). H2 displays good solubility in water (&#8805;7&#160;mM) but undergoes self&#8208;association at concentrations above 2&#160;mM. 1H NMR experiments establish that H2 binds cationic dyes inside its cavity with a &#960;&#8208;stacked geometry that places the cationic residues at the ureidyl carbonyl portals of H2. The binding constants of both naphthalene&#8208;walled clip H1 and anthracene&#8208;walled clip H2 toward a panel of dyes were measured by direct or competitive UV/Vis or fluorescence titrations in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Binding constants cover the range from 103 &#8211; 108 M&#8722;1. Dyes that feature cationic NMe2 groups bind more strongly than analogous dyes with cationic NH2 groups. We find that &#960;&#8208;extension of the aromatic walls from H1 to H2 generally results in an&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold increase in binding affinity. Host&#8226;guest complexes of H1 and H2 with planar cationic dyes benefit from substantial cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

Binding constants cover the range from 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &#8211; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Dyes that feature cationic NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups bind more strongly than analogous dyes with cationic NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups. We find that &#960;-extension of the aromatic walls from &lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; generally results in an&#160;&#8776;&#160;10-fold increase in binding affinity. Host&#8226;guest complexes of &lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; with planar cationic dyes benefit from substantial cation-&#960; interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Structure of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) at Elevated Pressures from Single&#8208;Crystal Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 50, September 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonic acid (H2CO3) was synthesized by a reaction of H2O with CO2 at moderate pressures and temperatures. For the first time, the crystal structure of an H2CO3 polymorph was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structural model was confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5 and 13&#160;GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at &#8776;8&#160;GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single&#8208;crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction&#160;data.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrative data&#8208;driven approach leveraging AI, computations, and robotic experimentation enables accelerated discovery of polyoxometalates, bridging synthetic unpredictability and paving the way for rational, predictive, and functional cluster chemistry.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanoscale, structurally versatile metal&#8211;oxo clusters with emerging applications in sustainability, energy, nanoelectronics, and life science technologies. Owing to their structural complexity, some all&#8208;inorganic POMs are often perceived as serendipitous outcomes from self&#8208;assembly processes, which poses challenges for scalable rational design. From this perspective, we therefore examine how the development of POM informatics and, more generally, data&#8208;driven POM exploration can pave the way for the molecular engineering of new POM&#8208;based materials targeting customized applications. In the process, we highlight recent successes in the digitalization of POM chemistry and outline which advanced technologies are necessary for progress in this promising area of&#160;research.

         <title>A Phosphorus(V)&#8208;Centered Porphyrin Having Redox&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Axial P&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;centered porphyrins are important functional dyes. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a phosphorus(V) porphyrin complex with hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;). 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is air&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates sequential redox couples among cationic, neutral open&#8208;shell, and anionic species.








Abstract
Phosphorus(V)&#8208;centered porphyrins (P(V)&#8208;porphyrins) are an important class of functional dyes in many fields of research, and axial ligands on the phosphorus atom affect the electronic properties of P(V)&#8208;porphyrins and add functions. Herein, we report on the synthesis and characterization of a hitherto unknown P(V)&#8208;porphyrin having hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;, PF6&#8211; is a counter anion). Synthesis of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; was achieved by treatment of dichloro&#8208;derivative (2+&#183;Cl&#8211;) with LiAlH4 followed by AgPF6 via hydride reduction accompanied by one&#8208;electron reduction and one&#8208;electron oxidation. The porphyrin core of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is nonplanar but considerably ruffled. The cyclic voltammogram of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates redox couples among 1+, neutral radical 1&#8226;, and 1&#8211;. Compound 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is tolerant toward air despite its PH2 moiety due to the energetically low&#8208;lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and &#963;(P&#8211;H) orbitals.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides with Silver Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have designed and fabricated an electrochemical biosensor based on target&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of peptides with silver nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that the biosensor exhibits high stability and specificity, with a detection limit of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor design is readily adaptable for detecting other biomarkers by simply modifying the cleavage sequence of one peptide.








Abstract
Peptides have great potential in the design and fabrication of biosensors because of their high specificity, multifunctionality, and relatively low cost. In this paper, we report an electrochemical biosensor leveraging multifunctional peptides and silver nanoparticles for integrated target recognition, self&#8208;assembly, and signal output. As a proof of concept, we chose granzyme B (GrB) as a model target. Specifically, when the target is present, the recognition peptide is cleaved, and the assembly peptide then anchors, exposing a positively charged sequence that attracts silver nanoparticles, thereby generating an electrochemical signal. The biosensor exhibits favorable analytical performance, with a linear detection range of 1 to 10000 fM and a remarkably low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor has been successfully applied to the analysis of clinical samples, confirming its potential for clinical detection and application.

This work reports the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes through a straightforward three&#8208;component reaction.

Abstract
In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous organometallic porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) catalyst for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes via a facile three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy enables the highly trans&#8208;selective syntheses of tetrasubstituted olefins in excellent yields. The catalyst is constructed by integrating triptycene (TP) and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) into a robust palladium&#8208;based porous framework, resulting in a unique heterogeneous system that efficiently mediates the coupling of internal alkynes with readily available iodoarenes and aryl/methyl boronic acids. This methodology also offers a versatile strategy for the syntheses of complex and valuable trans&#8208;selective alkenylsilanes under mild conditions, with high atom economy. Mechanistic studies support a trans&#8208;selective transformation pathway facilitated by the cooperative role of the polymer support and the palladium center. Importantly, the Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF catalyst exhibits excellent recyclability, air/moisture stability, and operational simplicity, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale and environmentally conscious synthetic applications. This work not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in the synthesis of highly substituted olefins but also exemplifies the principles of green chemistry through catalyst reusability, waste minimization, and efficient multicomponent transformation.

HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window): A Pioneering Integration of Thermochromic Hydrogels and Fe&#8208;Cr Redox Flow Batteries for Sustainable Building Energy Management. This study presents the HTF Window, the first&#8208;ever integration of thermochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels with Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It delivers three key functions: dynamic dual&#8208;band solar modulation covering visible and near&#8208;infrared ranges, high&#8208;efficiency energy storage, and adaptive thermal regulation&#8212;addressing inefficiencies in traditional building windows and standalone energy storage systems. The HTF Window has a four&#8208;layer structure. The outermost layer is indium tin oxide coated glass that acts as a transparent heater. Next is a hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogel layer enabling ultrafast optical switching, with visible transmittance dropping from 30% to less than 2% in 5 seconds. The middle layer is a microfluidic electrolyte channel that handles energy storage and forms a thermal coupling system. The innermost layer is glass for sealing and mechanical support. This design cuts the spatial footprint of Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries by 66%. Performance tests show the HTF Window reaches 77% energy efficiency, 13% higher than conventional Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It also boosts ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel ion highways, lowers the solar heat gain coefficient by 40%, and reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning energy consumption by 25%. Molecular dynamics simulations uncover that chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures in the hydrogel&#8208;electrolyte interface enhance battery discharge capacity. Cost and environmental analysis reveals the HTF Window has 30% lower capital expenditure and reduces 20&#8208;year carbon emissions by 42% compared to conventional systems combining separate windows and standalone Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. With a projected lifespan of over 20 years, it serves as a scalable solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, linking sustainable infrastructure to global decarbonization goals.








Abstract
This study introduces the HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window), the first groundbreaking integration of thermochromic windows and Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), achieving dual functionalities of dynamic solar modulation&#8212;via dual&#8208;band (visible&#160;+&#160;near&#8208;infrared, NIR) modulation&#8212;and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage in a single component. Leveraging tunable hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) hydrogels, it enables ultrafast optical switching and autonomous nighttime opacity, overcoming the slow response and privacy limitations of conventional thermochromic systems. By repurposing the window as a compact electrolyte reservoir, it reduces the RFB spatial footprint while enhancing ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel &#8220;ion highways,&#8221; achieving 77% energy efficiency with a 40% reduction in the solar heat gain coefficient. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal interactions between hydrogels and electrolytes, where chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures enhance battery discharge capacity. Addressing intermittent renewable energy grids and global carbon neutrality goals, the HTF Window stores surplus solar/wind energy to balance building&#8208;grid demand, reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by 25% across climates, and stabilizes electrolyte temperature via waste heat recovery to minimize thermal loads. With a projected 20&#160;+&#160;year lifespan, it offers a scalable, universal solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, bridging sustainable infrastructure and global decarbonization imperatives.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Copper(II)&#8208;Probe for Nitric Oxide Detection: A Reductive Nitrosylation Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a Cu(II)&#8208;probe for selective NO detection via a pH&#8208;responsive reductive nitrosylation approach showing fluorescence turn&#8208;on via displacement of nitrosylated ligand and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and a detection limit of 1&#160;nM.








Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in&#8208;situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge. Hence, a probe capable of directly detecting NO would be immensely valuable in understanding its reactivity and biological functions. Here, to develop a Cu(II)&#8208;based probe for selective NO detection, we synthesized a Cu(II)&#8208;complex (1) using a N3&#8208;tridentate ligand having a pendant dansyl fluorophore (L1) and evaluated it's NO reactivity under varying pH conditions. The binding of Cu(II) ion with ligand L1 to prepare 1 showed&#160;&gt;&#160;96% fluorescence quenching (fluorescence turn&#8208;off) compared to highly fluorescent free L1 (&#934; = 59%). Complex 1 did not react with NO in neutral or acidic medium; however, in the presence of onefold base (pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9), it showed the reductive nitrosylation reaction, which resulted in the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and ligand nitrosylation (L1&#8208;NO) with fluorescence turn&#8208;on. Studies performed using different reactive nitrogen /or oxygen species (RNS/ROS) suggest that probe 1 is highly selective toward NO with a detection limit of 1&#160;nM. For the first time, the base&#8208;catalyzed reductive nitrosylation of a Cu(II) complex resulted in the selective NO detection via fluorescence turn&#8208;on at pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9 in methanol /or aqueous buffer medium. To understand the effect of secondary amine (&#9472;NH&#9472;) sites in the above reductive nitrosylation reaction, a Cu(II) complex (2) of the ligand (L2), having two different (&#9472;NH&#160;sites, was reacted with NO under various pH conditions. Surprisingly, 2 showed selective mono&#8208;N&#8208;nitrosylation of the amine site coordinated to Cu(II) ion with the reduction of Cu(II) in the presence of onefold OH&#8722;.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

         <title>4&#8208;Dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide as a Fluorescence Signal Amplification for Site Selective and in Situ Probing of the Hydroxyl Radical</title>

4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) as new fluorescence&#8208;responsive tool for HO&#8226; detection. Proof of concept illustrating that NMI selectively probes HO&#8226; produced by Cu&#8208;bound to A&#946;16 in presence of scavengers with an amplified response.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in several diseases. Copper can be an efficient catalysts for ROS generation, as it was suggested for Cu bound to aberrant sites. Determination of rates and type of ROS production in more complex biological media is challenging and often only down&#8208;stream events can be monitored. Here, a selective detection of the hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), by a demethylation of 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) fluorescence probe by HO&#8226; resulting in &#8764;25&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield is reported. To investigate potential applications, the NMI was coupled to the Cu&#8208;binding domain of amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;16). This allowed the in situ fluorescence detection of HO&#8226; produced by A&#946;16 bound Cu due to the Fenton&#8208;type reaction. In a more complex medium with scavengers present including in cell culture conditions, the HO&#8226; produced in the bulk was not detected, in line with the short life&#8208;time of HO&#8226; in the presence of other molecules. Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction&#8208;based HO&#8226; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&#8226; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO Complex via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

Cooperativity wins: Judiciously designed heterobimetallic conjugates of Ru(II) and Fe(II) metal centers have shown remarkable redox cooperativity to achieve living and well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers.








Abstract
Employing heterobimetallic complexes (HBCs) offers an exciting and powerful strategy for various catalytic applications. Here, we present an unorthodox synthetic route to synthesize a novel RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic complex by implementing the strategy of &#8220;metalation with functionalization.&#8221; This complex utilizes a redox&#8208;assisted concerted strategy to facilitate the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) of acrylate monomers with significantly low catalyst loading. To understand the efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst over the other corresponding monometallic complexes, controlled polymerization experiments on acrylate monomers have been carried out. The redox cooperativity for efficient living CRP is very much pronounced and established in the RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic dyad as evidenced by multiple orthogonal experimental results and the interesting rearrangement in the frontier molecular orbitals during catalysis steps. A plausible mechanistic pathway is proposed based on insights from electroparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltametry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, rigid potential energy scans (PES), and the Fukui function. A modified atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) mechanism is offered by RuII&#8208;FeII conjugate, where redox&#8208;cooperativity and intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between the metal centers play a crucial role. This study investigates the potential of redox cooperativity in heterobimetallic systems, highlighting their efficacy as adaptable catalytic platforms.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

         <title>Host Cavities Enhance the Photocatalytic Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Terpinene to Ascaridole Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules are effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen, providing up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed.








Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules have been used as effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers in the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen. Host&#8208;guest interactions enhance the effective local concentration of the substrate and singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitizing host. This results in up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed. A tetramethyl BODIPY analogue, in which guest access to the host cavity is blocked, was also employed to confirm that the cavities do indeed enhance substrate turnover. Whilst the latter photocatalyst is more efficient due to the suppression of nonradiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation of the meso&#8208;phenyl substituent, the rate enhancement induced by host&#8208;guest binding is not present. Combined, this provides insight for the future design of enhanced systems.

         <title>An Unusual Activity of Conformationally Restricted Naphthalene Peri&#8208;Dichalcogenides in the Reduction of Nitro and Azide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the unique ability of a conformationally restricted dichalcogenide to reduce nitro and azide groups to their corresponding amines under physiological conditions. The redox potential is strongly influenced by the nature of chalcogen atom substitution as well as the conformational rigidity of the dichalcogenide bond.








Abstract
Rigid and conformationally restricted dichalcogenides based on 1,8&#8208;naphthyl system have attracted significant interest as electron donors in charge transfer complexes and organic electrode materials. Recently, naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;diselenides have been shown to mimic the function of two major selenoenzymes&#160;&#8722;&#160;iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) &#8722; mainly through two&#8208;electron redox processes involving deiodination of thyroid hormones and thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Herein, we report that naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;dichalcogenides can mediate a six&#8208;electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri&#8208;positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four&#8208;electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six&#8208;electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.

         <title>New ESIPT&#8208;Dyes of Record Capacity to Fluorescence Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donor and Acceptor Molecules, Including Local Water Concentration</title>

Multi&#8208;color fluorescent labels for detecting local water concentration at a selected cite of lipid&#8208;protein, protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;DNA complexes.








Abstract
5&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;hydroxychromones (3&#8208;HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5&#8208;substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position 5. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H&#8208;bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3&#8208;HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3&#8208;HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H&#8208;bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H&#8208;bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N&#8208;terminal or lysine&#8208;labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide&#8208;DNA, peptide&#8208;lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.

         <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Transformations of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes efficient EC and iPEC methods for the transformation of thioamides. The EC approach is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. On the other hand, the interfacial iPEC method, due to the lower applied potential, proved to be beneficial in terms of broadening the scope and limitations and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Pursuing innovative and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies is always a desirable goal in organic synthesis, and thus, we have developed green and sustainable electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (iPEC) transformations of thioamides into amides. The established EC protocol is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. iPEC cells are extensively studied for solar energy conversion, but their application in synthesizing high&#8208;value organic molecules has been limited. Here, we describe a strategy to use BiVO4, an abundant and robust photoanode, for the desulfurization of thioamides. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 oxidize thioamides to radical cations, which further react with the oxygen radical anion to produce amides. The proposed iPEC strategy presents a high promise for green organic chemical transformations with the goal of maximizing not only the atom economy but also the energy efficiency.

         <title>A Bichromophoric Triazatruxene Tetrad as a Highly Tunable Multicolor Emitter and Its Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a TAT tetrad, whose propargylic linkers electronically decouple the central TAT unit from the peripheral ones. This results in dual fluorescence and, at 77&#160;K, dual phosphorescence emission. The emission color varies with excitation wavelength from blue to yellowish white or orange.








Abstract
We report on the new star&#8208;shaped triazatruxene (TAT) tetrad 1, where three peripheral TAT moieties connect to a central TAT through propargylic spacers. The insulating nature of the linkers results in separate, partially overlapping blue and yellow&#8208;orange emissions from the peripheral and central TATs. This renders 1 a multicolor emitter, whose emission color can be tuned by the choice of the excitation wavelength and the solvent. In frozen solution, dual fluorescence emission from the two different types of TATs is complemented by dual phosphorescence with radiative lifetimes in the range of seconds. Organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) constructed with 1 as the emissive layer achieved a peak irradiance of 5.87 &#181;W/nm/m2 at 580&#160;nm at an operation voltage of 6.7&#160;V. Remarkably, the emission color of the electroluminescence can be varied from yellow over different hues of orange to red or&#160;even to near infrared (NIR) emission, depending on the applied voltage. Tetrad 1 is also redox&#8208;active, indicating that 1 may simultaneously serve as a hole conductor and emitter. Its oxidized forms are panchromatic absorbers from the near UV to the NIR due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;TAT charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorptions.

         <title>A Strategic Advance from Pincer Complexes to Hexadentate&#8208;Co(III) Catalyst for Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Activation of Primary Alcohols to Access Highly Functionalized Pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a first cobalt(III) catalyst [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 supported by a hexadentate ligand system with a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative approach for sustainable multicomponent reaction to access a library of highly substituted pyrimidines (150 examples) using dehydrogenation of aromatic as well as inactive aliphatic primary alcohols.








Abstract
In this report, we present a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly, practical, and cost&#8208;effective one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction for the synthesis of a diverse library of highly substituted pyrimidines from amidines, primary alcohols, and aromatic ketones, catalyzed by a cobalt(III) complex. The well&#8208;defined cobalt(III) complex [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 is derived from a redox&#8208;active phosphine&#8208;free, pentadentate mono&#8208;carboxamide ligand (BPMAP&#8208;H), and is formed in situ from various cobalt(II) sources, including CoCl2&#183;6H2O, CoBr2, Co(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, Co(OAc)2&#183;4H2O via oxygen activation. Using aromatic ketones and benzyl alcohols, a wide range of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines (TriPym) and 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrimidines (TetraPym) were synthesized (119 examples) in isolated yields of up to 93%. The catalytic system is also applicable to aliphatic ketones and aliphatic primary alcohols, affording 31 additional examples with yields of up to 92%. Control experiments and DFT calculations support a plausible mechanism involving dehydrogenation of the alcohols through a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathway.

         <title>Acidity Controlled Formal Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;based Iodonium Salt with O&#8208;nucleophiles: Synthetic Application and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method using hypervalent iodonium species derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas enables fast, mild, and efficient synthesis of fluoroalkyl ethers from phenols. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies show that phenol acidity influences the reaction pathway.








Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a novel O&#8208;fluoroalkylation of phenol derivatives using a hypervalent fluoroalkyliodonium salt, derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas (HFO&#8208;1234yf) as bulk fluorous feedstock, is reported. Optimization of the reaction conditions enabled versatile and efficient synthetic applications, and the synthetic study revealed phenol acidity&#8208;dependent selectivity of the O&#8208;fluoroalkylation process. The mechanistic behavior of phenols was supported by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. As a result, we showed that more acidic phenols (pKa &lt; 5) undergo direct O&#8208;alkylation, while reactions of the fluoroalkyliodonium salt involving less acidic phenol substrates proceed via a base&#8208;assisted chloride elimination and substitution pathway. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and halide competition experiments further validated the proposed mechanism. This practical and scalable method provides access to structurally diverse fluoroalkyl ethers and holds significant potential for applications in medicinal and materials chemistry.

         <title>The Important Role of the Polarization Effect in Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate that increasing the central atom size (Se/Te) and incorporating stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (&#8208;CF3, &#8208;F, &#8208;NO2) in cationic hypervalent ChB catalysts amplify the &#963;&#8208;hole, thereby strengthening ChB interactions. This polarization effect significantly lowers the bromine transfer barrier in the NBS bromolactonization reaction, enabling efficient and tunable organocatalysis.








Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysts have recently garnered considerable attention in the field of organocatalysis owing to their advantages of nontoxicity, environmental sustainability, extensive applicability, affordability, and remarkable reactivity. In this work, the Se&#8208; and Te&#8208;based cationic hypervalent ChB catalysis on the bromolactonization reaction of N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS) with 4&#8208;pentenoic acid is investigated by high&#8208;level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ChB&#8208;catalyzed bromolactonization reaction has an intricate process involving bromine transfer, cyclization, and proton transfer. Moreover, the bromine transfer process is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step with the highest Gibbs free energy barrier. The increase in the size of the central atom in the ChB catalysts and the enhancement of electron&#8208;withdrawing capabilities with greater dipole moments of substitutions on the catalysts provide larger &#963;&#8208;holes with stronger polarization effects, resulting in stronger ChB interactions with the reactant, thus lowering the reaction barrier. From a kinetic perspective, different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the catalyst can be used to regulate the reaction rate, leading to better experimental outcomes. These findings demonstrate the important roles of polarization effects in cationic hypervalent chalcogen bonds catalysis and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of novel environmentally friendly and efficient hypervalent ChB catalysts.

         <title>Speciation and Luminescence of a Binuclear Lanthanide Complex Bearing an Aminophenolate Chromophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide complexes are used in patients and for bioimaging and assays. The solution structure and speciation are critical when evaluating function, and here we fully unravel the structure and photophysics of a binuclear lanthanide complex.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) complexes show diverse speciation in solution. Here, the photophysical properties and speciation in solution of binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing an aminophenolate chromophore that reversibly bind to both metal centers were determined. The aminophenolate can reversibly bind to both lanthanide ions in a pH dependent manner. Above pH 3 the phenolate moiety remains deprotonated and the lanthanide complexes exhibit very high kinetic stability, however, protonation of the amino group modulates the luminescence intensity without changing the luminescence lifetime of the lanthanide. Below pH 3, protonation of the phenol results in a flexible, open structure, leading to reversible demetallation of the lanthanide complex as the system comes under thermodynamic control. This study highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of both the speciation and pH responsive behavior of highly luminescent binuclear lanthanide complexes for their development as responsive probes. These results confirm the promise of phenolate derived binuclear complexes as highly luminescent responsive probes, modulated by changes in pH.

This study highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of both the speciation and pH responsive behavior of highly luminescent binuclear lanthanide complexes for their development as responsive probes. These results confirm the promise of phenolate derived binuclear complexes as highly luminescent responsive probes, modulated by changes in pH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Mapping of Homoserine Lactone and Cyclodextrin Binding Strengths &#8212; Effects of Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of homoserine lactone (HSL) signaling molecules used by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria with native and substituted cyclodextrin (CD) host molecules was mapped. Between differently substituted HSLs with different alkyl chain lengths, chain length governed binding affinity. Between &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CDs, the wider &#946;&#8208;CD cavity was found to be more tolerant of substitutions in terms of binding constant.








Abstract
Directing the collective behavior of bacteria is important for various applications in chemical bioproduction, water treatment, and antibiofilm solutions. A potential approach to such control mechanisms lies in sequestering signal molecules (autoinducers) by macrocyclic host molecules that lower the effective concentration of the former, modulating bacterial signaling. Cyclodextrins (CD) &#8212; one of the best&#8208;established families of hosts &#8212; have been shown to bind homoserine lactones (HSL) acting as autoinducers, but with a focus limited to shorter (&#8804; 8 carbons) tailed molecules and &#946;&#8208;CD. Here, we have systematically mapped binding affinities for HSLs of three different tail lengths and with different 3&#8208;site substituents (used for signal differentiation), with native and substituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CDs. The HSL alkyl chain length has the most influence on affinity, although the 3&#8208;substitution also slightly affects the binding constant. Little difference between native CDs was observed, but the binding ability of &#945;&#8208;CD was more susceptible to even minute substitutions. The wider &#946;&#8208;CD core could be substituted with greater modularity without impairing HSL binding ability. The results constitute an initial chemical toolbox to be applied in guiding host design for HSL sequestering in, for example, therapeutic applications, but also in constructing systems for the modulation of bacterial collective behavior.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The formation of two regioisomers was explained using DFT calculations as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.








Abstract
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported. This method allowed an access to a large array of cyclobutenoates as a mixture of regioisomers. The products were isolated in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The synthetic utility of the products was showcased and the mechanism was studied. Thanks to DFT calculations, the formation of two regioisomers was explained as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.

         <title>Small Molecular Dibenzochalcogenophenes as Potent Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles recent achievements and applications of purely organic small luminescent DBC. We present frequently employed functionalities and design strategies, accomplishing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). In addition, we discuss the challenges for luminescent selenium and tellurium derivatives as well as the influence of commercial impurities on the photophysical properties of this compound class.








Abstract
Dibenzochalcogenophenes (DBC) have attracted huge attention ever since the discovery that they are able to act as potent (phosphorescent) emitters more than 60 years ago. From then on, they were extensively used as versatile emissive platforms for applications in materials science and optoelectronics. In this review, we focus on the main achievements of the past 20 years, highlighting especially monomolecular small purely organic compounds with less than 10 aromatic units and only one chalcogenophene moiety. Besides this, we wish to focus on their emission properties and to evaluate general design principles to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties.

         <title>Reusable Br&#248;nsted Acidic Ionic Liquid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Quinolines to Functionalized Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) followed by reductive alkylation by the aldehyde has been demonstrated under mild reaction conditions with a shorter reaction time. This step&#8208;economical synthetic approach is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide range of reducible&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The current reductive N&#8208;alkylation approach was also successfully utilized to synthesize novel tricyclic oxazino&#8208;fused&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline/benzoxazine compounds via tandem reductive cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;(8&#8208;quinolinyloxy) ethanones. Further reductive protocol has been applied for the synthesis of antiarrhythmic drug nicainoprol and tubulin polymerization inhibitor efficiently. Notably, BAIL was easily recovered and reused multiple times without a considerable loss in catalytic activity. The elucidation of the underlying mechanism was achieved through a combination of several control experiments, kinetic studies, and isotopic labelling experiments. This study offers a new reaction pathway for the reduction of quinoline, in which BAIL facilitates proton transfer through a distinctive hydrogen bonding ion&#8208;pair mechanism.

         <title>Synthetic Membranes for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries (AORFBs): towards&#160;High Conductive and Selective Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as a leading electrochemical technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, using water&#8208;based electrolytes to deliver inherent safety and cost efficiency. High&#8208;performance ion exchange membranes&#160;promote the battery performance, including energy/power densities, operational durability, and Coulombic/energy efficiencies. This review examines recent advances in ion channel engineering for AORFB membranes, focusing on chemical synthesis strategies, structural optimization approaches, and ion channel architecture evolution. We analyze characterization methodologies for diverse membrane types, their corresponding cell performance, and design principles.&#160;We highlight conductivity&#8208;permeability relationships across membrane architectures, particularly microphase separation, microporous channels, and dual&#8208;ion configurations, establishing fundamental structure&#8208;property correlations.&#160;These insights provide a strategic roadmap for future ion channel design in membranes, advancing practical frameworks for high&#8208;performance AORFBs.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their use of water&#8208;based electrolytes, offering safety and cost advantages over organic solvent&#8208;based systems. AORFBs utilize organic molecules derived from earth&#8208;abundant elements, enabling tunable properties such as solubility, stability, and redox potential at the molecular level. These features enable improvements in energy and power densities, operational lifetimes, and efficiency metrics in the battery system. However, the lack of suitable ion exchange membranes limits the energy efficiency, power density, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Membrane design for AORFBs faces challenges in balancing conductivity and permeability, requiring precise control over ion transfer channel size, quantity, and interconnection. This review summarizes recent advances in AORFBs membrane design, focusing on ion channel engineering through chemical and microstructural adjustments. We highlight the impact of these designs on membrane conductivity, permeability, and overall cell performance, aiming to provide a practical framework for developing superior membranes for future grid&#8208;scale AORFBs applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Isoquinoline&#8208;Containing Lipoxin A4 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1R)&#8208; and (1S)&#8208;Epimers of novel isoquinoline&#8208;derived SPMs were prepared, with a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction and a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation as the key synthetic steps. Biological assessment demonstrated that several analogues significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF.








Abstract
The resolution of inflammation is increasingly recognized as an active, highly regulated process essential for restoring tissue homeostasis following immune activation. Lipoxin&#8208;A4 (LXA4), an endogenous specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator (SPM), plays a central role in this process through activation of the ALX/FPR2 receptor. However, its clinical application is limited by rapid metabolic degradation and poor in vivo stability. In this study, we report the design, asymmetric synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;based analogues of LXA4 (Isoq&#8208;sLXms), designed to enhance metabolic stability. The synthetic route employed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck cross&#8208;coupling and Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, affording diastereomerically pure compounds. Biological assessment in THP&#8208;1 LUCIA monocytes demonstrated that several analogues, particularly (1R)&#8208;8, significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF. Functional assays using ALX/FPR2&#8208;transfected HEK&#8208;293 cells revealed that (1R)&#8208;8 acts as a partial agonist, supporting its role in engaging pro&#8208;resolving signaling mechanisms. Safety profiling confirmed low cytotoxicity across physiologically relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate that isoquinoline&#8208;based LXA4 mimetics retain and enhance key pro&#8208;resolving bioactivities while offering improved stability and receptor selectivity. (1R)&#8208;8 emerges as a promising lead compound for the development of resolution&#8208;directed therapeutics in the context of chronic inflammation.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Dependent Mallory Photocyclization Constructs Rigid Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Enhanced Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons have been synthesized via highly efficient Mallory reaction, and exhibited extended aromatic skeleton with high quantum yields in solutions and aggregation casued quenching in solid states.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of three saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&#8212;bFT&#8208;C, bFP&#8208;C, and bFP2&#8208;C&#8212;via Mallory photocyclization of bisfluorenylidene&#8208;dihydroacene precursors. The reaction achieved high yields (77&#8211;88%) under UV irradiation, with structural characterization confirming enhanced aromaticity and rigid frameworks in the cyclized products. Kinetic studies revealed that anthracene&#8208;containing bFP2 exhibited the fastest reaction rate, which we attribute to its elevated electron density. Photophysical studies showed strong solution fluorescence (PLQY: 45&#8211;48%) but aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in solids due to enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Electrochemical analyses revealed reversible redox processes, while low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy identified deep&#8208;red phosphorescence (lifetimes: 72.6&#8211;270.0&#160;ms). This work demonstrates how precursor architecture governs reaction kinetics and photophysical properties, providing a design strategy for nonplanar PAHs with tailored luminescence characteristics.

         <title>Transformation of Silyl&#8208;Protected Tetrafluorinated Thia[6]helicene S&#8208;Oxide into a Difluorinated Coronene via Induced Desilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilyl&#8208;protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S&#8208;oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected S&#8208;oxide and S,S&#8208;dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.








Abstract
Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S,S&#8208;dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding S&#8208;oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene S&#8208;oxide ring suppresses self&#8208;condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its S,S&#8208;dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS&#8208;protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene S&#8208;oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.

         <title>Layered MnAl Complex Oxide Realizes the Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Transformations of 1,2&#8208;Diols and Alcohols Under Normal Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient catalyst based on MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) has been developed for the aerobic oxidative transformations of 1,2&#8208;diols and alcohols under normal pressure without any additives. The excellent electron transfer ability and strong surface basic sites of the catalyst realize the oxidation primarily via two&#8208;electron transfer (TET), and minorly via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes.








Abstract
An efficient and convenient MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) catalyst has been developed. Characterization results indicated that Mn2Al&#8208;LDO exhibits an improved ability of electron transfer and increased surface strong basic sites on its surface compared to the layered double hydroxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDH) precursor and conventionally prepared Mn2AlOx. These characters endow the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO with excellent catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative cleavage of 1,2&#8208;diols under normal pressure without additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both the two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes are included in the catalytic reaction, with the former being more prominent. The Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system can tolerate a broad substrate scope, including monosubstituted 1,2&#8208;diols, internal 1,2&#8208;diols, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and various &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. Additionally, the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system also exhibits excellent catalytic stability and shows great potential for application in cascade transformations.

         <title>Inherently Chiral Calix[4]Arene Derivatives: Concept and Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arene derivatives with inherent chirality, which arises from the twisted macrocyclic structures of the linked aryl groups. This development is crucial for applications in chiral catalyst design and the creation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Two main strategies have been extensively explored: the de novo synthesis of macrocycles and the desymmetrization of prochiral calix[4]arene derivatives. This review highlights the enantioselective synthetic approaches used to achieve inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives and offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future advancements in this field.








Abstract
Calix[4]arene derivatives possess chirality derived from macrocycles with twisted linked aryls and have numerous applications in chiral recognition, chiral sensors, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, and enantioselective catalysis. Due to their unique structural scaffolds, calix[4]arene derivatives have seen increased attention in enantioselective synthesis in recent decades. Although many achievements have been made in this area based on desymmetrization or de novo macrocycle synthesis strategies, new calix[4]arene derivatives structures and efficient enantioselective synthesis methodologies are highly desirable. This review highlights recent enantioselective synthesis strategies and provides perspectives for future developments.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Mirror&#8208;Image Fast&#8208;PETase by the Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>

Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror&#8208;image plastic&#8208;degrading enzyme, the D&#8208;form of 231&#8208;residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror&#8208;image 271&#8208;residue D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase was presented by using an enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20&#8208;fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D&#8208;ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic&#8208;related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror&#8208;image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic&#8208;associated health risks.

&lt;p&gt;Mirror-image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic-degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror-image plastic-degrading enzyme, the D-form of 231-residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror-image 271-residue D-Fast-PETase was presented by using an enzyme-cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D-Fast-PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20-fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D-ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic-related health issues within the biomedical field.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Imine Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Organizing Cross&#8208;Reactive Anion Receptor and Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine macrocycle comprising pyrroles as hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and an environmentally sensitive fluorophore displays a wide cross&#8208;reactive binding, which, in combination with an analyte&#8208;specific fluorescence response allows differentiation between ten analytes and their concentrations. Thus, one cross&#8208;reactive sensor performs the work of multiple, essentially acting as a &#8220;sensor array of one molecule&#8221;.








Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing macrocyclic receptor&#8208;sensors for phosphorus oxyanions, phosphates, and phosphonates comprising imine moieties were prepared by condensation of dipyrrolylmethane dicarbaldehyde with diethylene triamine. The incorporation of flexible ethylene moieties endows the macrocycle with unprecedented flexibility and ability to accommodate numerous phosphorus oxyanions from orthophosphate to large anions such as ATP or phosphonate glyphosate. The anion binding was elucidated by NMR titrations, low&#8208;temperature NMR, and NOESY NMR. The incorporation of dansyl fluorophore enables sensing of anions using the fluorescence signal, whereas the changes in fluorescence intensity, width of the fluorescence band, and position of the maxima are analyte&#8208;specific and useful in recognition and identification of eleven different P&#8208;oxyanions in water. The affinity (Kassoc) for Na+ salts was H2PO4&#8722; &#8776; Methylphosphonate&#160;&gt;&#160;H2P2O72&#8722; &gt; Phenylphosphonate&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;Glyphosate2&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;AMP2&#8208; &gt; ADP2&#8722; &gt; ATP2&#8722;. Interestingly, phosphonates, including methylphosphonate and glyphosate anions, were also found to display a strong affinity (Kassoc&#160;&#8764;106 M&#8722;1) while halides, nitrate, carbonates, or hydrogen sulfate did not show a significant affinity. The determined fluorescence spectral parameters were used to classify the 12 analytes (11 anions and water) using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Quantification was performed using LDA and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the phosphonate concentrations in unknown samples were determined with an error of 3.5% or lower.

         <title>Beyond Neuroprostanes: Total Synthesis and Epilipidomic Studies of a Novel Cyclopentenone Metabolite of Docosahexaenoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroprostanes are bioactive oxylipins from docosahexaenoic acid oxidation, serving as oxidative stress biomarkers. In this work, the enantioselective synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP has been accomplished using Michael addition, olefin metatheses, and Wittig olefinations as key steps. Notably, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was detected for the first time in trout brains, underscoring its biological significance.








Abstract
Neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) are bioactive oxylipins formed in vivo from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main polyunsaturated fatty acid of the human brain, by a nonenzymatic auto&#8208;oxidative process as mixtures of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomers. Thus, synthetic material is necessary to unlock their potential as oxidative stress biomarkers as well as to investigate the biological properties of individual NeuroP molecules. Despite recent advances in the field, cyclopentenone&#8208;type NeuroPs have received limited attention. Here, we present an enantioselective total synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and its dehydrated metabolite, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP. The asymmetric synthesis of the chiral core relies on a robust organocatalyzed Michael addition. The assembly of the full carbon framework was accomplished via selective double olefin metathesis and Wittig olefination. The MS2 spectra of the 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was carefully studied using molecular network and quantum chemistry software to elucidate its unique fragmentation pattern. Also, preliminary analytical studies showed for the first&#8208;time tangible amounts of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP in trout brains.

Click chemistry promises a simple method to produce pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)&#8208;based DNA binders. DNA binding and covalent crosslinking capabilities have been validated for &#8216;clicked&#8217; PBD heterodimers using thermal denaturation analysis, mass spectrometry and DNase I footprinting. One dimer induced strong DNA cross&#8208;linking and cellular cytotoxicity, indicating the future potential for dimerization in living cells.








Abstract
The covalent cross&#8208;linking of DNA duplex strands by small molecule drugs is a validated mechanism in anticancer therapy. The pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) have been established as potent DNA binders that can achieve inter&#8208; and intrastrand DNA cross&#8208;links when dimerized, and have been used as cytotoxic payloads in multiple antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). In this study, we explore the potential of click chemistry to obtain PBD heterodimers. The heterodimers D1&#8211;D4 were prepared by copper catalyzed or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (SPAACs) from the corresponding monomers M1 &#8211; M4 and MbA. The interactions of monomers and dimers with DNA were evaluated by DNA thermal denaturation analysis, a newly developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based method for the detection of single stand and double strand modifications, and by DNase I footprinting. All methods demonstrated the DNA binding and cross&#8208;linking capabilities of D1. Testing for cytotoxicity in three cell lines revealed that the monomers M1 and M4 and the dimers D1 and D4 were the most potent. The click chemistry approach opens an easy access to larger libraries of PBD&#8208;based DNA binders, including the option for dimerization in live cells.

         <title>Alternating Orthogonal Switching in a Thiophenyl&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Bis&#8208;Azobenzene Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs computational calculations and ultrafast spectroscopy to design and probe alternate isomerization in a bis&#8208;azobenzene molecule. The phenyl&#8208; and thiophenylazobenzene moieties exhibit independent switching under different wavelengths, advancing multi&#8208;photoswitch applications.








Abstract
To design efficient molecular information storage systems with multi&#8208;photoswitchable entities, orthogonal isomerization of the different switchable moieties is essential. Various challenges, like unintentional energy transfer, spectral overlap, and other energy dissipation channels, have to be addressed by intelligent molecule design. In this context, we took advantage of calculations to design a bis&#8208;azobenzene switch, which consists of a phenyl&#8208; and a thiophenylazobenzene moiety in meta&#8208;connection to reduce &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies confirmed that this bis&#8208;photoswitch exhibits alternating orthogonal switching behavior when irradiated with light of different wavelengths. These results represent a significant advancement toward the development of efficient and adaptable organic multi&#8208;photoswitches for applications, such as information storage, molecular machines, or smart materials.

         <title>Circular Dichroism and Multiphoton Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching Using a Bis&#8208;perylene Diimide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral and configurationally stable bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle is reported, which exhibits switchable circular dichroism (CD) and multiphoton circularly polarized luminescence (MP&#8208;CPL). This behavior is realized due to the macrocycle's tuneable chiral conformation, which impacts the intrinsic and supramolecular helicity of the perylene diimide dimer.








Abstract
Chiroptical switches exhibit stimuli&#8208;induced changes in the sign or strength of their circular dichroism (CD) or circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and are materials with significant potential for chiroptical sensing and biological imaging. However, the chromophores used in chiroptical materials usually require excitation by ultraviolet or visible light, which results in higher cytotoxicity and lower penetration compared to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoexcitation. This can be overcome by multiphoton excitation, yet multiphoton CPL (MP&#8208;CPL) has been challenging to measure in organic emitters. Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent chromophores with which to develop MP&#8208;CPL emitters due to a chiral &#960;&#8208;system capable of two&#8208;photon absorption. Furthermore, the integration of these chiral PDIs into stimuli&#8208;responsive macrocycles affords configurational stability and the potential for chiroptical switching, due to the chromophore's tuneable chiral conformation. In this work we report a chiral bis&#8208;PDI macrocycle with stable, yet conformationally dynamic, enantiomers, and in doing so realize a novel chiroptical material that combines switchable CD and MP&#8208;CPL for the first time.

         <title>Zincophilic MOF Protective Layer for Stable Zinc Anodes in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are under the spotlight due to their substantial potential, abundant natural resources, inherent safety, and high specific capacity. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth and side reactions on the zinc surface hinder the application of ZIBs. In this article, a uniform copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) coating layer was fabricated on a zinc metal surface (CuZIF@Zn) to serve as a protective interface. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques were employed to study the electrode structure before and after cycling. With its special structure, the MOF interfacial layer acts as an effective barrier layer to isolate the zinc anode from water molecules and electrolyte, thereby suppressing interfacial side reactions and passivation. Additionally, the abundance of zincophilic sites in the CuZIF layer ensures uniform deposition of Zn2+ while effectively inhibiting the growth of dendritic structures. Consequently, the CuZIF@Zn//CuZIF@Zn symmetric batteries exhibited cycling stability over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, attributed to the protective layer. Furthermore, a full cell incorporating an MnO2 cathode maintained 189 mAh g&#8722;1 over 700 cycles, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance.

         <title>Interfacial Co&#8208;Operativity Enables Ultrafast Charge Transfer Within the Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue|Zno Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This combined spectroscopic study shows that when the interfacial composition of PBA|ZnO heterostructure is engineered via a facile synthetic protocol the interfacial CT is promoted by a cooperative mechanism. In this mechanism, pre&#8208;existing oxidized PBA units at the interface facilitate structural rearrangements within the coordination network, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier of the process and improving its water oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
Heterostructures of Cobalt&#8208;Iron (Co&#8208;Fe) Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and inorganic semiconductors are attractive materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Their efficiency is rooted in the charge transfer (CT) at the PBA|semiconductor interface. The interfacial CT, however, often suffers from sluggish kinetics, optimization of which has been elusive. In this work, we investigate PBA|ZnO heterostructures spectroscopically and show that tuning the interfacial composition of the heterostructure presents a synthetic handle to significantly improve interfacial CT. We employ ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the CT kinetics, while interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational spectroscopy, that is, time&#8208;resolved and in&#8208;situ vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG), sheds light on the molecular response to the CT across the interface. These measurements reveal that cooperative intermolecular interactions at the PBA|ZnO interface are key to achieving efficient CT. Furthermore, we relate the CT observed on ps&#8208;timescales to the functional properties of the PBA|ZnO heterostructure in terms of photocatalytic water oxidation, which increases by about 200% in absolute yield as compared to a heterostructure without interfacial co&#8208;operativity. Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.

Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric and Geometric Tuning of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Antennae in Europium(III) Complexes for Selective ADP Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present four new macrocyclic Eu(III) complexes and demonstrate how ligand structure and positional tuning of &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennae modulate steric demand and anion binding site geometry. This enables size and shape complementarity for selective ADP recognition in water over competing phosphoanions.









Abstract
The selective recognition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in water presents a significant challenge for synthetic supramolecular chemistry, driven by its biological importance in cellular energy transfer and enzymatic signaling pathways. Discriminating ADP from structurally similar anions such as ATP requires a high degree of host&#8211;guest complementarity. We recently developed [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722;, a luminescent Eu(III) complex bearing two 6&#8208;substituted quinolyl&#8208;phenoxyacetate arms, which create a binding site at the central Eu(III) ion that accommodates ADP. Binding induces a tight interaction in water, involving both metal coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, switching the emission on with a 33&#8208;fold enhancement. Here, we examine how systematic changes in ligand geometry influence anion selectivity, by synthesizing four new Eu(III) complexes with pendant arms at the 4&#8208; or 7&#8208;positions of the quinoline scaffold. The 4&#8208;substituted systems provide a more accessible binding site and bind ADP, ATP, and AMP with limited selectivity between them, while the 7&#8208;substituted analogues impose steric hindrance at the Eu(III) center, resulting in minimal response to all tested anions. Only the 6&#8208;substituted complex [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722; achieves optimal geometrical complementarity for ADP binding. These findings reinforce the importance of steric and geometric control in the design of selective lanthanide probes for biological anions in water.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Plasmon&#8208; Induced Hole Injection in Electroactive Luminescent Monolayers on Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the ability of plasmons to switch on the fluorescence of molecular monolayers through a hole injection process, in combination with an electrochemical reduction triggered at the tip and transferred to the monolayer by a redox mediator.








Abstract
A dual and simultaneous modulation of fluorescence intensity and electrochemical current induced by plasmon activation is demonstrated using a combination of electrochemical (SECM) and fluorescence microscopies, employing fluorescent redox monolayers grafted onto gold nanoparticles. The observed electrochemical and optical responses are fully consistent with a direct hole injection from the plasmonically excited metallic nanoparticles into the grafted monolayer. In particular, an unprecedented fluorescence intensity enhancement occurs upon simultaneous electroreduction at the tip and plasmon activation, whereas each process taken separately leads to a fluorescence quenching. The electrochemical current enhancement is significantly larger for functionalized nanoparticles compared to bare ones under plasmon activation, opening the route toward new strategies in photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Intepirdine Derivatives Possessing Dual 5HT6 Antagonism / HDAC6 Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of developing therapies for dementias and cognitive decline, potent dual acting molecules targeting the GPCR 5HT6 and the enzyme HDAC6 with favorable BBB penetration profile were designed and synthesised.








Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically. In this context, we explored the design and synthesis of dual 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonists / HDAC6 inhibitors since these actions have been individually demonstrated to elicit cognitive&#8208;enhancing effects. Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram&#8208;scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG&#8208;283AG emerged to possess sub&#8208;micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC50&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (Ki&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5&#8208;HT6&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual&#8208;acting 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive&#8208;enhancing properties.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Antibiotics: Light&#8208;Driven Eradication of Bacterial Biofilm and Rapid Healing of Infective Wounds in Wistar Rat</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of biocompatible&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;based photo&#8208;antibiotics that increase oxidative stress via ROS generation (both type I and type II pathways) and NADH oxidation, killing bacterial cells and eradicating bacterial biofilm with a novel mechanism. Moreover, the lead photo&#8208;antibiotics eradicated the gram&#8208;negative bacterial colony from the infected wounds in a rat model within 3 days and healed the wound completely within 9 days, bridging the gap between aPDT outcomes and clinical trials.








Abstract
Three novel Ru(II)&#8208;based photoantibiotics,&#160;viz., [Ru(phtpy)(N,N,N)2](PF6)2, where N,N,N&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (phtpy, Ru1), 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NMe2tpy, Ru2), trifluoromethylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (CF3tpy, Ru3) were developed with excellent photostability for visible light&#8208;activated antibacterial activities and infective wound healing. Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;exhibited an absorption in the 400&#8211;600&#160;nm range, beneficial for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) application. Upon visible light exposure (400&#8208;700&#160;nm),&#160;Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;inhibited bacterial growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), due to the effects of oxidative stress via ROS generation and photo&#8208;oxidation of NADH. Ru3 was identified as a lead antibiotic that further showed antibiofilm activities against E. coli under visible light exposure. Ru3 was found to be biocompatible against rat red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Ru3&#160;+&#160;light promoted rapid healing of infected wounds within 9 days in an E. coli&#8208;induced rat model, highlighting its potential future use in healthcare.

         <title>Substrate Epoxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase Dapdiamide Biosynthesis Enzyme C. Why Is the Substrate Tethered?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a computational study shows the differences in binding and catalysis of a nonheme iron oxygenase with tethered versus nontethered substrate. The tethered substrate is positioned in an ideal orientation near the active site, while the nontethered substrate shows more dynamics and is not positioned well for double bond epoxidation.









Abstract
Enzymes usually react with a free substrate, although some examples have appeared in the literature of enzymes that utilize a substrate tethered to a protein carrier. However, it is not clear what advantage the tethering has, and therefore a computational study was performed. In particular, we report here the first computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase involved in the epoxidation reaction during the dapdiamide biosynthesis (DdaC) and investigate tethered and nontethered substrates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the protein carrier applies pressure onto the surface of the protein and influences the fold and active site description and leads to differences in substrate&#8208;oxidant interactions. Quantum chemical calculations give much lower epoxidation barriers for the activation of the tethered substrate by 7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 over the nontethered substrate and highlight the advantage of a tethered substrate in catalysis.

         <title>Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross&#8208;Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross&#8208;links via reactions of the ring&#8208;opened AP&#8208;aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/N&#8208;glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose (1), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2&#8208;aminopurine&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross&#8208;links did not mirror yields of the respective cross&#8208;links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in duplex DNA. Rather, the differences in yields for the various AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links must reflect effects exerted by the 3D structure of double helical DNA on the cross&#8208;linking processes.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic CO2 reduction toward multi&#8208;carbon products, emphasizing key advances in catalyst design. Strategies including atomic site dispersion, co&#8208;catalyst integration, defect engineering, and utilization of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are discussed to promote C&#8211;C coupling, offering insights into selective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction represents a sustainable pathway for mitigating carbon emissions and producing renewable chemicals by utilizing solar energy. While extensive research has been dedicated to single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, the selective formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds, such as ethylene, ethane, ethanol and acetic acid, has garnered increasing attention due to their higher energy density and broader industrial relevance. However, achieving efficient C&#9472;C coupling under mild photocatalytic conditions remains a formidable challenge, hindered by complex reaction pathways, sluggish kinetics and competitive side reactions. In this review, recent advances in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products was systematically summarized, focusing on fundamental reaction mechanisms, rational photocatalyst design strategies, including atomically dispersed active sites, cocatalyst loading, defect engineering, and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). By bridging mechanistic understanding with materials innovation, this review provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems for efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion, contributing to sustainable carbon utilization and circular chemical economy.

This study presents the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs are created with two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations, for which the nature of cation controlled their transport and electrochemical properties. 








Abstract
Here we present the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs) derived from biomass. Two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] are coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations to create the ILs, for which the nature of cation controlled their properties. For instance, the thermal decomposition temperature ranges from 183 to 259&#160;&#176;C, the glass transition temperature from&#160;&#8722;&#160;47 to&#160;&#8722;&#160;70&#160;&#176;C, and the ionic conductivity from 0.002 to 1.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. The supercapacitors prepared using [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] exhibited specific capacitances of 99 F g&#8722;1 and 70 F g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The [EPy][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 56&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as a power density of 410&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, while the [EMPip][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 360&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. In addition, the supercapacitors retained 98% and 94% of their initial capacitances after 6000 cycles, for [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Graphene Quantum Dots Drive Spontaneous Metal Reduction to Form Stable and Electroactive Core&#8208;Shell Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208;carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.








Abstract
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of &#8764;8.0, &#8764;7.0, and &#8764;3.0&#160;nm diameter Au, Ag, and Pt cores; respectively, wrapped by as&#8208;synthesized crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Functional sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208; hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp3&#8208;carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.

Functional sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two-fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate-coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion in Spin Crossover Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>

The NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion properties of SCO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the first time, offering novel insights into the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.








Abstract
The synthesis of multifunctional materials that exhibit two or more distinct physicochemical properties is critical for the development of advanced smart materials. To date, the research regarding the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal properties of spin crossover (SCO) materials remains scarce. Here, we synthesized an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type cationic framework, [Fe{Ag(CN)2}(TTF(py)4)]+ (1, TTF(py)4&#160;=&#160;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene), which exhibits hysteretic SCO behavior. By introducing p&#8208;aminoazobenzene (Azo&#8208;NH2) and pyrene (Pyr) into 1, two solvent&#8208;free derivatives, 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr, incorporating free radicals were generated. NIR&#8208;II photothermal experiments revealed the outstanding photothermal properties of 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr under 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation. Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiment demonstrated that 1@Pyr achieved a water evaporation rate of 0.9197&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 63.9%. This represents the first demonstration of outstanding NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion performance in an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating free radicals generated through host&#8208;guest interactions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating NIR absorption units into SCO systems, providing new insights for the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.

The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported.

Abstract
The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. Beyond that, base&#8208;pairing of xanthine nucleosides opposite canonical nucleobases is studied. To this end, a building block of 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine was prepared using 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine as starting material. A simplified synthesis for large&#8208;scale production is presented for the phosphoramidite of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad). Hybridization of oligonucleotides gave duplexes containing single or multiple incorporations of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pairs with different combinations of nucleobases. From melting curves and Tm values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad base pair reached the stability of dT&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad and dG&#8208;dC pairs. 7&#8208;Deazaxanthine located opposite 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaxanthine. For 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8208;aminoadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;7&#8208;deazaadenine. The impact of pK values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthraquinone Mono&#8208; and Diboron Complexes with Near&#8208;Infrared Panchromatic Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthraquinone boron complexes bearing &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate ligand(s) exhibit strongly substituent&#8208;dependent absorption properties. Unsubstituted monoboron and diboron complexes show sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra resulting from increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, dimethylamino&#8208;substituted complexes display near&#8208;infrared (NIR) panchromatic absorption, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and multiple electronic transitions.








Abstract
Anthraquinone monoboron complexes 3 and 4, possessing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and diboron complexes 7 and 8, featuring a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, were readily synthesized in two steps from commercially available reagents. These boron complexes adopt a &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate structure and their absorption properties are markedly affected by the type of the substituent groups. The unsubstituted monoboron complex 3 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;3,950 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 7 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;2,510 cm&#8722;1) exhibited sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra, which can be attributed to increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;7,580 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 8 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;8,770 cm&#8722;1) showed broad absorption bands due to the enhanced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) character. Dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 and diboron complex 8 exhibited panchromatic absorption ranging from 400&#160;nm to 1,000&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm to 1,250&#160;nm, respectively. The panchromatic absorption of the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted boron complexes 4 and 8 is attributed not only to the enhanced ICT character but also to the combination of multiple transitions.

Showcasing sono&#8208; and mechanochemistry: A sonochemistry&#8208; and mechanochemistry&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;synthetic approach for biologically and synthetically promising cyanomethyl carboxylates as a rapid, high&#8208;yielding, and robust alternative synthetic protocol under metal catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
We herein disclose a dual synthetic approach involving sonochemical and mechanochemical strategies for a diverse series of cyanomethyl esters of carboxylic acids. Both synthetic protocols offer a straightforward, efficient, and practical alternative to preparing this important class of biologically and synthetically promising organic compounds. Significant advantages of the newly developed methods include mild reaction conditions, avoidance of any metal catalysts and external oxidants, shorter reaction times (in minutes), good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope and tolerance of other various functional groups, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and reusability of the solid surface.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Stabilization and Folding Pathways of &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides: A Computational Investigation Using Steered Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed molecular simulations to investigate the stabilization of &#945;&#8208;helical structures in HFIP compared to aqueous environments. SMD simulations demonstrated the stretching polypeptide chains to effectively preserve &#945;&#8208;helical conformations and enhance structural stability through solvation effects.








Abstract
Fluorinated polar solvents, such as hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), are known to denature proteins into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich structures, a phenomenon of interest in protein engineering and fiber science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a valuable approach to explore protein folding mechanisms. In the present study, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were conducted to stretch the polypeptide models along the &#945;&#8208;helix axis in different solvents. The potential of mean force (PMF) associated with nonequilibrium stretching of the polypeptide chain was higher in HFIP than in water and varied depending on amino acid composition and degree of polymerization. HFIP molecules preferentially concentrated in grooves of &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptides. Stretching the polypeptides in HFIP resulted in the formation of 310&#8208;helix structures, suggesting that local solvation enhances structural stability. Additional SMD simulations of Trp&#8208;cage, a mini&#8208;protein driven by hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, showed partial unfolding of the &#945;&#8208;helix region and global extension of both termini. The resulting PMF profiles indicate that &#945;&#8208;helices are formed in the early stages of Trp&#8208;cage folding. This study offers an analytical framework that can be extended to more complex amino acid sequences and proteins with diverse structural motifs. HFIP appears to play a central role in the &#945;&#8208;helical transformation of higher&#8208;order protein structures.

         <title>Phytic Acid Assisted Preparation of Cu3P/Cu@C Composites as High Performance Anodes for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaniline was polymerized and deposited on the surface of Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells, and utilizing phytic acid as phosphorus source, a unique Cu3P/Cu@C composite spherical structure with with N,P&#8208;codoped graphitic carbon nanotubes entwined has been fabricated through a simple high&#8208;temperature annealing. Such porous and doped Cu3P&#8208;carbon anodes show excellent rate capability with ultra&#8208;long service life at current density up to 2000 mA/g.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes show new perspectives in high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but harsh synthesis and severe capacity attenuation seriously preclude their practical application. Here, Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells are designed to utilize as sacrificial templates for polyaniline loading, and with the assistance of phytic acid (PA), a novel Cu3P/Cu@C microsphere composite structure is successfully constructed via direct thermal annealing, in which heteroatom&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanotubes are wounded with each other and firmly entangled on spheres. The polyaniline polymerization by (NH4)2S2O8 and the addition of PA are indispensable for the unique Cu3P sphere formation. Both the spherical Cu3P structure and its doped carbon encapsulating could largely alleviate volume expansion during lithium storage, while the intertwined carbon nanotubes provide fast transport channels for Li+. Therefore, as anode, it exhibits relatively stable cyclic performance, and after 10,000 cycles at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 2000 mA/g, it still maintain a capacity of 278.57 mAh/g with capacity retention of 73.12%. Through analysis, large specific surface area and multi&#8208;level pore distribution of the optimized Cu3P&#8208;carbon anode, and the extended interlayer spacing of doped carbon are conducive to the reversible intercalation and adsorption of Li+. Electrochemical mechanism analysis also confirms its dramatic surface pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and excellent reaction kinetics.

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
