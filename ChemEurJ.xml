         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture&#160;engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures&#160;are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that&#160;the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules.&#160;Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3 molH2&#183;min&#8208;1&#183;molmetal&#8208;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#160;kJ&#183;mol&#8208;1,&#160;and good stability. Furthermore, by combining&#160;infrared spectroscopy&#160;and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;DABCO Salts as an Unprecedented Sensing Platform for the Detection of Thiols and Selenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary&#160;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based "off&#8208;on" fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescent intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescent quantum yield (~72%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. Limits of detection for&#160;p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22 nM and 6 nM respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Switchable Ru Nanoaggregates for Enhancing Phototherapy: Hyaluronidase&#8208;Triggered Disassembly to Alleviate Deep Tumor Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2in situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15 nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of defects and charges on the colloidal

stabilization of graphene in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications.For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for grapheneproduction. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding largeenergy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can beovercome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) as starting material. The greaterinter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation ofsoluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied bythe oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueousgraphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into manyprocesses or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for thestability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation andsolvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of the EdG. We show that the amountof defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing thematerial to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidizedgraphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of the EdG.</dc:description>

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 0.003 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.</dc:description>

Electron-donating 5-substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 0.003 M-1s-1 with 5-trifluoromethyl-N-methyl-3-oxidopyridinium to 1.07 M-1s-1 with 5-amino-N-methyl-3-oxidopyridinium. 3-oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Detrimental Functional Groups in Conductive Additives Toward High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1 wt% reduced Super P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2 mAh g&#8208;1, which is much higher than the 130.8 mAh g&#8208;1 of untreated Super P. Impressively, reduced Super P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8% than 64.6% of untreated Super P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8208;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#180;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#180;,3&#180;,3&#180;&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E. coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being different from conventional reductive coupling reactions of nitroarenes, structurally modifiable heterogeneous cobalt catalysts reveal excellent performance in precise use of a single intermediate during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the nitroarenes. This concept would provide a novel direction for the efficient utilization of nitroaromatics in the manufacture of high&#8208;value products.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8211;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8211;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8211;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8211;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report our recent discovery of mechanochemical C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation reaction of indoles using 3&#8201;d transition metal (iron and cobalt) via online preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents. This method addresses the limitations of the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization, and provides an efficient, concise, and sustainable approach for this field.







Abstract
Although the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical technology toward in&#8208;situ preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents, and thus building two general 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic platforms that enables regioselective arylation and alkylation of indoles with a wide variety of halides (including those containing post transformable functionalities and heteroaromatic rings). This mechanochemical strategy also brings unique reactivity and high step&#8208;economy in producing functionalized N&#8208;free indole products.

         <title>Photopharmacology of Protease Inhibitors: Current Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No fear of the dark. Photopharmacology is an emerging technique in which bioactive molecules are turned on (or turned off) by means of light. This enables a spatial and temporal control of their activity. In this review, we discuss the progress of photopharmacology in the field protease inhibitors.







Abstract
Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research.

&lt;p&gt;Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side-effects of protease-targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Molecules Mimic Alkali Metals Enabling Spontaneous Harpoon Reactions with Halogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) behaves like alkali metals and reacts with halogens (X) via the harpoon mechanism to form charge&#8208;separated omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; complexes.harpoon reactionlong range electron transferphotoelectron spectroscopy







Abstract
The harpoon mechanism has been a milestone in molecular reaction dynamics. Until now, the entity from which electron harpooning occurs has been either alkali metal atoms or non&#8208;metallic analogs in their excited states. In this work, we demonstrate that a common organic molecule, octamethylcalix[4] pyrrole (omC4P), behaves just like alkali metal atoms, enabling the formation of charge&#8208;separated ionic bonding complexes with halogens omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; (X=F&#8722;I, SCN) via the harpoon mechanism. Their electronic structures and chemical bonding were determined by cryogenic photoelectron spectroscopy of the corresponding anions and confirmed by theoretical analyses. The omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; could be visualized to form from the reactants omC4P+X via electron harpooning from omC4P to X at a distance defined by the energy difference between the ionization potential of omC4P and electron affinity of X.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosylated Soluble Fas Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite aerogel composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid&#8208;reduced graphene oxide was successfully fabricated by the freeze&#8208;drying method, which could achieve the adsorption of multiple types of dye (such as methylene blue and methyl orange) due to the generation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks with dyes.







Abstract
Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33&#8201;%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2&#8197;mg/g and 66.6&#8197;mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.

         <title>A Primer on 2D Descriptors in Selectivity Modeling for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two&#8208;dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using the 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer the tremendous advantages of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for the in&#8208;silico screening of large amounts of data. We provide an overview of common quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, and an outlook on improving the understanding of 2D&#8208;based models.

         <title>Preparation of carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites by mussel&#8208;like modifications as high&#8208;performance anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>

Carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites as high&#8208;performance anode were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, where electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on polydopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the Ti3C2Tx surface, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Meanwhile, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation.







Abstract
Fe2O3 with high theoretical capacity (1007&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low cost is a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but its practical application is restricted by its low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation. To solve these problems, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, which relies on the self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under mild conditions. During polymerization, the electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on dopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface and mitigates self&#8208;accumulation of MXene nanosheets. In addition, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation during the hydrothermal process, which can further improve the electrical conductivity of the composites and buffer the volume expansion and particle agglomeration of Fe2O3. As a result, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx anodes exhibit ~100&#8201;% capacity retention with almost no capacity loss at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and a stable capacity of 430&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The unique structural design of this work provides new ideas for the development of MXene&#8208;based composites in energy storage applications.

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of Lewis base catalyst by fine&#8208;tuning of pyridine Lewis basicity has allowed for the development of chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;pyridine (MOPY) catalyst for enantioselective cyclopropanation.







Abstract
The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization: Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histidine amino acid forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The affinity of histidine in oligopeptides strongly depends on the neighbouring residues in the sequence, with the strongest binding observed for Tyr&#8208;His and Leu&#8208;His.







Abstract
Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8722;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8211; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8722;H Olefination</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (direct C&#8722;H olefinations) are used as key step to access small&#8208;molecule hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). NDT core&#8208;based HTMs incorporating additional olefins as &#960;&#8208;spacers substantially improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells of up to 17.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8722;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71&#8201;% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core&#8208;based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;&#8208;spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2&#8201;% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.

         <dc:description>
The covalent anchoring of electron acceptors derived of [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;fullerene&#8208;methyl butyrate (PC61BM and PC71BM) to carbon dots (CD) was carried out successfully and the obtained hybrid nanomaterials characterized by means of AFM microscopy, and FTIR and XPS spectroscopies. Electrochemical and photophysical studies confirmed the electronic communication between the covalently connected units and their promise for further photo&#8208; and electronic applications.







Abstract
The covalent incorporation of C60 and C70 derivatives of the well&#8208;known n&#8208;type organic semiconductor PCBM ([6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester) onto carbon dots (CD) is described. Morphological and structural characterization reveal combined features of both pristine starting materials (CD and PCBM). Electrochemical investigations evidenced the existence of additional reduction processes to that of CD or PCBM precursors, showing rich electron&#8208;acceptor capabilities, with multistep processes in an affordable and narrow electrochemical window (ca. 1.5&#8197;V). Electronic communication in the obtained nanoconjugated species were derived from steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopies, which showed bathochromically shifted absorptions and emissions well entering the red region. Finally, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of CD&#8208;PCBM nanoconjugates, compared with CD, and the fast decay of the observed emission of CD, support the existence of an electronic communication between both CD and PCBM units in the excited state.

         <title>Aerobic Catalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Furans with Indoles Provides Access to Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between furans and indoles using earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst FeCl3.6H2O in presence of oxygen. The reaction displayed scalability and aqueous compatibility, thus making it practical, operationally simple, and sustainable. The products were found to possess fluorescence properties with remarkable Stokes&#8217; shift of upto 205&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Sustainability in chemical processes is a crucial aspect in contemporary chemistry with sustainable catalysis as a vital parameter of the same. There has been a renewed focus on utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts to expand the repertoire of organic reactions. Furan is a versatile heterocycle of natural origin used for multiple applications. However, it has scarcely been used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. In this work, we have explored the cross&#8208;dehydrogentive coupling of furans with indoles using commonly available, inexpensive FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (&lt;0.25&#8197;$/g) as catalyst in the presence of so called &#8216;ultimate oxidant&#8217; &#8211; oxygen, without the need for any external ligand or additive. The reactions were found to be scalable and to work even under partially aqueous conditions. This makes the reaction highly economical, practical, operationally simple and sustainable. The methodology provides direct access to &#960;&#8208;conjugated short oligomers consisting of furan, thiophene and indole. These compounds were found to show interesting fluorescence properties with remarkably large Stokes shift (up to 205&#8197;nm). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through chemoselective oxidation of indole by the metal catalyst followed by nucleophilic trapping by furan.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene transfer reaction was realized in the biosynthetic pathway. Using L&#8208;limonene as the precursor, L&#8208;carveol was biotransformed by P411&#8208;PFA to generate unnatural terpenoid derivatives with trifluoromethyl group.







Abstract
Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature&#8216;s repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical analysis of the Triphenylamine&#8722;Thiophene Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission luminogen was conducted in solution and PMMA films. In a solution, emission can arise from either the locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, depending on the solvent. In PMMA films, only LE state emission occurs, but excimer&#8208;like formations reduce emission intensity. This effect was probe in Luminescent Solar Concentrator.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade system was first proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine with transaminase and threonine aldolase. This cascade reaction system can not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also the PLP is utilized as the only cofactor in these reaction system.







Abstract
A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95&#8201;% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54&#8201;% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.

This cascade reaction system can not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co-product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also the PLP is utilized as the only cofactor in these reaction system.

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade nanocatalytic reaction system is fabricated. The reasonable combination of the high catalytic efficiency derived from Cu+, in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2 and consumption of intratumoral glucose induced by GOx, and the upregulation of ROS level evoked by selenocompounds has resulted in the excellent synergistic therapeutic effect in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8722; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;&#8201;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8722; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.

         <title>Structural Impact of N&#8208;terminal Pyroglutamate in an Amyloid&#8208;&#946;(3&#8208;42) Fibril Probed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>

Solid state NMR spectroscopy on fibrils of recombinant, pyroglutamylated [U&#8208;13C,15N]&#8208; pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) show highly similar &#946;&#8208;strand positions and a conserved turn region around V24 comparable to LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. Due to missing D1&#8208;A2 and pE3 formation a salt bridge of K28&#8208;D1' is absent in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils. G37&#8208;G38 act as sensors for the N&#8208;terminal modifications in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils.







Abstract
Extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, primarily formed by A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The A&#946; peptide can undergo a high variety of different post&#8208;translational modifications including formation of a pyroglutamate (pGlu, pE) at N&#8208;terminal Glu3 or Glu11 of truncated A&#946;(3&#8208;x) or A&#946;(11&#8208;x), respectively. Here we studied structural similarities and differences between pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) and LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils grown under identical conditions (pH&#8197;2) using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the central region of pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils including the turn region around V24 is almost identical to A&#946;(1&#8208;42) showing similar &#946;&#8208;strands also at the N&#8208;terminus. The missing N&#8208;terminal residues D1&#8208;A2 along with pE3 formation in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) preclude a salt bridge between K28&#8208;D1' as in A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. G37 and G38 act as highly sensitive internal sensors for the modified N&#8208;terminus, which remains rigid over ~five pH units.

The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and melts yield the dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and the mononuclear Cr(VI) dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the intimately ion&#8208;paired cations and dianions interact through Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianion salts. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms, where the [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.

The reactions of XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro-dianion salts, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro-dianion salt, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;][Xe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;][CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. The salts were structurally characterized by low-temperature (LT) single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianions have distorted octahedral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F-atoms are trans to one another and two F-atoms are trans to O-atoms, where the [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion is the fluorine-bridged dimer of the [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Quantum-chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy-minimized, gas-phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas-phase dianions and their ion-pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion-pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe-&#8201;-&#8201;-F &#963;-hole bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Fluorescence in Both Solution and Solid States Induced by Imine Cage Formation</title>

The imine&#8208;bonded TPE&#8208;cage exhibits a remarkable enhancement (~520&#8208;fold) in fluorescence emission compared to the building block TPE&#8208;TA in both solution and solid states, highlighting the effect of rigidification&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement.







Abstract
Developing luminescent materials that exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid phases is highly desirable and challenging. Herein, we report imine&#8208;bond directed formation of a rigid organic cage (TPE&#8208;cage) that was synthesized by [2+4] imine condensation of a TPE&#8208;cored tetra&#8208;aldehyde (TPE&#8208;TA) with a clip&#8208;like diamine (XA) to illustrate confinement&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement. Compared to the non&#8208;emissive TPE&#8208;TA (&#981;F=0.26&#8201;%) in the dichloromethane (DCM) solution, the TPE&#8208;cage achieved a remarkable (~520&#8208;fold) emission enhancement (&#981;F=70.38&#8201;%). In contrast, a monomeric tetra&#8208;imine model compound (TPE&#8208;model) showed only a minor enhancement (&#981;F=0.56&#8201;%) in emission compared to the parent tetra&#8208;aldehyde TPE&#8208;TA. The emission of TPE&#8208;cage was further enhanced by ~1.5&#8208;fold (&#981;F=80.96&#8201;%) in the aggregated state owing to aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). This approach establishes the potential for synthesizing luminescent materials with high emission in both solution and solid&#8208;state by employing a single&#8208;step imine condensation reaction.

         <title>Pertechnetate/perrhenate&#8208;capped Zr/Hf&#8208;Dihydroxide Dimers: Elucidating Zr&#8722;TcO4 Co&#8208;Mobility in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>

The well&#8208;known Zr/Hf4&#8208;tetramer is cleaved in aqueous solutions by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield a dihydroxide dimer capped by these oxoanions. Structure and solution characterization of this complex along with solvent extraction studies elucidates 93Zr&#8208;99Tc co&#8208;extraction (two of the most abundant and problematic 235U fission products) during nuclear fuel reprocessing.







Abstract
Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [MIV4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X=Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8722; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized ZrIV2(OH)2(ReVIIO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8901;dimer.

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign single step methodology has been established for selectfluor mediated single atom skeletal manipulation of 2H&#8208;indazoles through internal C&#8208;atom insertion. Water&#8208;O18 labelling experiment confirms the carbonyl oxygen source is H2O.







Abstract
A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both indazole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into the trimer to create a new heterobimetallic photocatalyst. The presence of ester groups in the Zn porphyrin trimer significantly deactivated CO2 reduction. After converting the ester groups to acetoxymethyl groups, the photocatalytic activity was remarkably enhanced. The modified trimer exhibited Re&#8208;induced phosphorescence, which was quenched by an electron donor, indicating efficient electron transfer during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R=methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>

         <dc:description>
The most favourable bonding scenario in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis&#8208;silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.







Abstract
Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilised in singlet ground states by using different donor base ligands. Driess et&#8197;al. in particular have made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8722;SiI/GeI&#8722;GeI di&#8208;cationic units. The energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) study focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalise why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a di&#8208;anionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8722;C bond (2.38&#8211;2.68&#8197;&#197;) and undergoes unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a crystalline POM@MOF (Ir&#8722;SiW) by assembling Ir metalloligands and POMs for the first time. Ir&#8722;SiW has high activity for selective oxidation sulfide to sulfoxide, with a yield of 99.5&#8201;% within 2.5&#8197;h, which is higher than the currently known POM&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate @metal&#8208;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (Ir&#8722;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5&#8197;h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm) reached 99.5&#8201;%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97&#8201;% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8722;SiW.

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.







Abstract
Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.

Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid-catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder-ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU&#8208;713@Ni) as heterogeneous all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom&#8208;up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU&#8208;713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU&#8208;713/Ni prepared via post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactive TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF and its metalated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF, which can both serve as the efficient reusable photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications, are reported.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8242;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy&#8722;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.

         <title>Electrophilic Fluorination of Silyl Dienol Ethers: a General and Selective Access to &#947;&#8208;Fluoro Enals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was achieved from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The complete selectivity towards the &#947; position was rationalized thanks to DFT calculations.







Abstract
We describe the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro enals from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers. This simple process operates under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities. The high &#947; regioselectivity of this protocol was rationalized by means of theoretical calculations.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear gold(I) complexes with ferrocenylphosphane and different bridging ligands such as, chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate have a significant influence in their reactivity. Chloride&#8208;bridged complexes excel as highly efficient catalysts, while thiolate&#8208;bridged ones exhibit varied conversion rates. Additionally, the use of monophosphane or diphosphane ligands introduces intriguing performance differences, offering prospects for customized catalytic systems.







Abstract
The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic &#8220;self&#8208;activated&#8221; precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of asymmetric amine ethers proceeds via efficient transesterification. Two tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfates are prepared in high yields and applied as intermediates of transesterification to synthesize asymmetric amine ethers, which has significant advantages over the conventional process.







Abstract
A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ethers is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst with a dynamic configuration has been successfully synthesized and subsequently resolved. Both experimental and DFT studies show that the stereogenic rhodium center preserves its chiral information. Furthermore, the resolved complex provides enantiomeric ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. These findings highlight its immense potential in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The unique dynamic configuration of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane Composed of Nickel Diselenide Nanosheets with Carbon Nanotubes for Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane composed of nickel diselenide nanosheets (NSN) modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been succeeded in preparing via hydrothermal and vacuum filtration technology. The three&#8208;dimensional networks of CNTs facilitate the transport of electrons and ions. In this process, NSN acts as catalytic centers, thereby accelerating the redox conversion of polysulfide species remarkably elevating the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6 catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 786.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles (0.2&#8197;C) at the sulfur loading 5.4&#8197;mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at a high discharge rate of 2&#8197;C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33&#8197;mAh even at 10.8&#8197;mg for duration of 100&#8197;cycles. This research indicates the potential application of NSN@CNTs hybrid materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

A ferrocene reflects on the moon surface, illuminating a bridge between two gold metal centers. This imagery captures the use of bridging ligands in the synthesis of ferrocenyl gold(I) dinuclear complexes. Two dragons embody distinct bridging ligands and their consequential structures. The green dragon symbolizes the incorporation of chloride bridging ligands, its pointed gaze directed towards the corresponding molecular structure of the chloronium gold(I) complex. The yellow dragon represents the use of the pentafluorophenylthiolate ligand, visually joined to its intricate X&#8208;ray diffraction structure. These dynamic depictions underscore the pivotal role of these bridging ligands in influencing catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of a cyclization reaction, thus establishing a visually compelling narrative of the study focus and outcomes.

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate selectivity is the property of catalysts like enzymes to pick up one substrate among many others in solution. To implement substrate selectivity in artificial homogeneous catalysts, an emerging approach in homogeneous catalysis consists in exploiting self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;catalysts and nanocontainers. The confinement effects provide supramolecular substrate recognition before the catalytic step. This review covers recent achievements in this challenging field of research.







Abstract
Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.

         <title>Development of Platinum Complexes for Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoimmunotherapy is a novel treatment for cancers via synergy between chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Pt complexes could be developed into chemoimmunotherapeutic agents as inducers of immunogenic cell death, inhibitors of immune checkpoint, stimulators of immune response, relievers of immunosupression, or modulators of immune signal. They reshape the tumor microenvironment and reinforce the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are potential antitumor drugs in chemotherapy. Their impact on tumor treatment could be greatly strengthened by combining with immunotherapy. Increasing evidences indicate that the antitumor activity of platinum complexes is not limited to chemical killing effects, but also extends to immunomodulatory actions. This review introduced the general concept of chemoimmunotherapy and summarized the progress of platinum complexes as chemoimmunotherapeutic agents in recent years. Platinum complexes could be developed into inducers of immunogenic cell death, blockers of immune checkpoint, regulators of immune signaling pathway, and modulators of tumor immune microenvironment, etc. The synergy between chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory effects reinforces the antitumor activity of platinum complexes, and helps them circumvent the drug resistance and systemic toxicity. The exploration of platinum complexes for chemoimmunotherapy may create new opportunities to revive the discovery of metal anticancer drugs.

The quality of separators is thoroughly assessed by systematically analyzing and scrutinizing aspects such as cost, functionality, safety, and environmental sustainability in their preparation. This comprehensive evaluation serves as a guide for the objectives and future directions for separators research of zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Urea Hangman Mn Terpyridine species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the  proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 s&#8208;1&#160;with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100% &#177; 3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for CO&#160;as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55 V in overpotential with respect to the latter.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of PMNs during prolonged usage. This concept foucs on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60 &#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Investigation of a Soluble Distannene with no Trans&#8208;Bent Angle or Twisting in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By treating KSiiPr3 with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 the distannene Sn2(TIPS)4 (TIPS = iPr3Si) is formed in a metathesis reaction. The crystal structure analysis of Sn2(TIPS)4 reveals a planar arrangement of the substituents in the solid&#8208;state and hence the second planar alkene like distannene of its kind. Due to the TIPS substituents, Sn2(TIPS)4 is well soluble in all commonly used organic solvents, opening the door for various analytics and reactivity studies. Due to its stability in solution, various reactions can be performed such as cycloaddition reactions with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DMBD) and TMS&#8208;azide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8208;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation/Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission in Naphthyridine&#8208;Based Carbazolyl&#8208;Modified Donor&#8208;Acceptor Boron Dyes Tunable by Fluorine Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59% in pure dye samples and 86% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Isolobal Relation between Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;NiP3 and White Phosphorus by Experimental Charge Density Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolobale principle as established by Hoffmann was tested in this work by the highest level of experimental charge density analysis. X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction fitting as well as multipolar modelling showed in accord that [Ni]P3 is a suitable isolobale analogue to white phosphorus. The deep dive into its bonding analysis reveals insights about the differences in reactivity compared to P4.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics of a series of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines with O, S, Se, and Te heteroatoms is strongly structure&#8208;dependent. Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the O and S dyads possess a pseudo&#8208;equatorial structure and the lowest energy excited singlet state has charge&#8208;transfer character, but the Se and Te dyads possess pseudo&#8208;axial structure and a tolan localised excited state.







Abstract
The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X=O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1&#8197;ns to 0.42&#8197;ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40&#8201;%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the Cu&#8208;catalysed coupling of alkylboronic esters and aliphatic amines. This mild method is functional group tolerant, and uses O2 from air as the terminal oxidant. Investigation into the mechanism suggest that the boronic ester reacts with an aminyl radical, formed in&#8197;situ, to generate an alkyl radical intermediate.







Abstract
We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoxides by A Cyclic Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system with cofactor regeneration was established for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides using prochiral sulfildes as substrates. Heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of MsrA, Fus&#8208;SMO and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. The system involves the cooperation of a low&#8208;enantioselective chimeric oxidase SMO (styrene monooxygenase) with a high&#8208;enantioselective reductase MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A), facilitating &#8220;non&#8208;selective oxidation and selective reduction&#8221; cycles for prochiral sulfide oxidation. The regeneration of requisite cofactors for MsrA and SMO was achieved via a cascade catalysis process involving three auxiliary enzymes, sustained by cost&#8208;effective D&#8208;glucose. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a series of heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were synthesized through this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one step&#8221; cascade reaction. The obtained compounds exhibited high yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and demonstrated enantiomeric excess (ee) values exceeding 90&#8201;%. This study represents an unconventional and efficient biocatalytic way in utilizing the low&#8208;enantioselective oxidase for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides.

         <title>Solvent Geometry Regulated J&#8208; and H&#8208;Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase&#8208;Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrated solvent geometry regulated J and H&#8208;type of aggregates of an azobenzene containing photo switchable organogelator (AZO&#8208;4). The supramolecular polymerization of AZO&#8208;4 leads to formation of 1D&#8208;nanofiber, which transforms into small length nanofiber upon UV irradiation due to trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization. This can gelate various hydrocarbon solvent and oil, thus can be used for oil spill recovery applications.







Abstract
We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO&#8208;4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO&#8208;4 exhibits J&#8208; and H&#8208;type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and MCH: toluene (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self&#8208;assembly process. The J&#8208;type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO&#8208;4 &#960;&#8208; surface with the toluene &#960;&#8208;surface, whereas H&#8208;aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO&#8208;4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO&#8208;4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step&#8208;strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter (&#916;Hm) of gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.

     alt="Solvent Geometry Regulated J- and H-Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase-Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrated solvent geometry regulated J and H-type of aggregates of an azobenzene containing photo switchable organogelator (AZO-4). The supramolecular polymerization of AZO-4 leads to formation of 1D-nanofiber, which transforms into small length nanofiber upon UV irradiation due to &lt;i&gt;trans-to-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization. This can gelate various hydrocarbon solvent and oil, thus can be used for oil spill recovery applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO-4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO-4 exhibits J- and H-type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and MCH: toluene (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self-assembly process. The J-type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO-4 &#960;- surface with the toluene &#960;-surface, whereas H-aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO-4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J- and H-aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO-4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step-strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter (&#916;H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of gel-to-sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How do they bind ? New cystobactamid derivatives with duplicated triarene unit served to elucidate their bent shape conformation (CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees) by NMR analysis. Elongation of the triarene unit of cystobactamids lead to increased DNA binding affinity implying that they exert their inhibitory activity by interaction with the gyrase itself as well as with DNA via their triarene unit.







Abstract
Cystobactamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#956;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.

         <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell 19F&#8197;NMR methodology has been proved as a practical tool for investigating the conformations, dynamics and interactions of biomacromolecules. Herein, we review its unique benefits, recent progress of sample preparation and application in this field. Based on their in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo studies, we also provide the future directions and outlook.







Abstract
In vitro, 19F&#8197;NMR methodology is preferably selected as a complementary and straightforward method for unveiling the conformations, dynamics, and interactions of biological molecules. Its effectiveness in&#8197;vivo has seen continuous improvement, addressing challenges faced by conventional heteronuclear NMR experiments on structured proteins, such as severe line broadening, low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and background signals. Herein, we summarize the distinctive advantages of 19F&#8197;NMR, along with recent progress in sample preparation and applications within the realm of in&#8208;cell NMR. Additionally, we offer insights into the future directions and prospects of this methodology based on our understanding.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxypyrroloindoline Affords Tryptathionine and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;Indole Peptide Staples: Application to Melanotan&#8208;II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optionality for Indole&#8208;based Peptide Stapling: hydroxypyrroloindoline, used regularly in reaction with cysteine to form a tryptathionine (Ttn) staple is found to react competitively with an indole to form a 2&#8217;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole tether (BITe). Judicious choice of protecting groups provides for chemoselectivity for optionality in terms of which staple is formed. Both staples are featured on a melanocortin peptide macrocycle and show nanomolar dissociation constants.







Abstract
With peptides increasingly favored as drugs, natural product motifs, namely the tryptathionine staple, found in amatoxins and phallotoxins, and the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole found in staurosporine represent unexplored staples for unnatural peptide macrocycles. We disclose the efficient condensation of a 5&#8208;hydroxypyrroloindoline with either a cysteine&#8208;thiol or a tryptophan&#8208;indole to form a tryptathionine or 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole staple. Judicious use of protecting groups provides for chemoselective stapling using &#945;&#8208;MSH, which provides a basis for investigating both chemoselectivity and affinity. Both classes of stapled peptides show nanomolar Ki&#8217;s, with one showing a sub&#8208;nanomolar Ki value.

         <title>Carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 nanospheres with excellent battery&#8208;like supercapacitor performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiY@CQDs electrode materials prepared by a hydrothermal method have an excellent electrochemical property with a mass&#8208;specific capacitance of 2,944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The NiY@CQDs//AC asymmetric supercapacitors can reach an energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a high power density of 1,500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Supercapacitor is an important energy storage device widely used in the automobile industry, military production, and communication equipment because of its fast charge&#8208;discharge rate, and high power density. Herein, carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (NiY@CQDs) nanospheres are prepared by a solvothermal method and used as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties of NiY@CQDs were measured in a three&#8208;electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) cell was assembled with activated carbon (AC) as the anode and NiY@CQDs as the cathode. The electrochemical properties of the ASC device were measured in a two&#8208;electrode system. Experimental results show the shape of NiY@CQDs is petal&#8208;shaped and the introducing carbon quantum dots and doping Y3+ significantly increases the specific surface area, conductivity, and specific capacitance of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4. The mass&#8208;specific capacitance of NiY@CQDs reaches up to 2944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The asymmetric supercapacitor of NiY@CQDs//AC has a high energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, displaying a wide range of application prospects in the energy storage area.

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central ring puckering of xanthene dyes leads to a substantial increase of their Stokes shift. This puckering can be induced in xanthene dyes by introducing sp3 hybridized bridging groups into their scaffold. The Stokes shift can be fine&#8208;tuned by the steric hindrance of the bridging group. Herein, we introduce this concept as a novel general strategy for fluorescent dyes design.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.

         <title>Sniffing Out the Sustainable Future: The Renewability Revolution in Fragrance Chemistry**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the impact of the transition from today&#8217;s petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of svanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. Citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. In the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric one&#8208;carbon homologation or ring expansion of ketones with formal insertion of carbene intermediate, is a challenging but useful strategy to construct a complex skeleton. Sc(III) and chiral ligands have been employed in this regard. However, due to flexible conformations and a variety of stereo models, the origin of stereochemistry remains ambiguous. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the interactions that control the stereoselectivity of a Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation. The trans influence of counterions was found to affect the coordination mode of ketone to Sc(III), and consequently affect the stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Combined UV/Vis and NMR Setup with Fixed Pathlengths for Mass&#8208;limited Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of reaction mechanisms is a complex task that usually requires the use of several techniques. To obtain as much information as possible on the reaction and any intermediates &#8208; possibly invisible to one technique &#8208; the combination of techniques is a solution. In this work we present a new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy and compare it to an established alternative. The presented approach allows a versatile usage of different commercially&#8208;available components like mirrors and fiber bundles as well as different fixed pathlengths according to double transmission or single transmission measurements. While a previous approach is based on a dip&#8208;probe setup for conventional NMR probes, the new one is based on a micro&#8208;Helmholtz coil array (LiquidVoxel&#8482;). This makes the use of rectangular cuvettes possible, which ensure well&#8208;defined pathlengths allowing for quantification of species. Additionally, very low quantities of compound can be analyzed due to the microfabrication and small cuvette size used. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle this new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy is used to examine a well&#8208;studied photochromic system of the dithienylethene compound class. A thorough comparison of the pros and cons of the two setups for combined UV/Vis and NMR measurements is performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Pyridothiophene Compounds for PET Imaging of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) protein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers to image &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates has been a longstanding goal.&#160; We the pyridothiophene scaffold for &#945;&#8208;syn PET radiotracers, where 47 derivatives of a potent pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44; Kd = 1.85 nM) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem PD brain homogenates. Equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) values of the most potent compounds were determined, of which three had Ki's between 12&#8208;15 nM. An autoradiography study confirmed that [3H]asyn&#8208;44 is promising for imaging&#160; multiple system atrophy and PD. Fluorine&#8208;18 labelled asyn&#8208;44 was synthesized in 6&#177;2% radiochemical yield (decay&#8208;corrected, n=5) with a molar activity of 263&#177;121 GBq/&#181;mol. Preliminary PET imaging of [18F]asyn&#8208;44 in rats showed high initial brain uptake (&gt;1.5 standardized uptake value (SUV)), moderate washout (~0.4 SUV at 60 min), and low variability. Radiometabolite analysis showed 60&#8208;80% parent tracer in the brain after 30 and 60 mins. While [18F]asyn&#8208;44 displayed good in vitro properties and acceptable brain uptake, troublesome radiometabolites precluded further PET imaging studies. The development of additional pyridothiophene derivatives are underway, with the goal of attaining improved affinity and metabolic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 Core&#8208;Shell Catalysts for Efficient Oxidation of p&#8208;Diethylbenzene to High Value&#8208;Added Derivatives</title>

TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 zeolite with core&#8208;shell structure was synthesized and used in the catalytic oxidation of p&#8208;diethylbenzene. The reaction conditions and the oxidation mechanism of p&#8208;diethylbenzene were determined. The synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell zeolite improves the oxidation activity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene, and improves the selectivity of products while taking into account the selectivity of raw materials.







Abstract
To expand the market capacity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene (PDEB), core&#8208;shell zeolite (TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48) is designed as a catalyst for PDEB oxidation. TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 catalyst is synthesized by in&#8208;situ crystallization method and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS&#8208;NMR). Oxidation of PDEB by H2O2 was investigated systematically in liquid phase. The conversion of PDEB over TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 was 28.1&#8201;% and the total selectivity was 72.6&#8201;%, where the selectivity of EAP (p&#8208;ethylacetophenone) and EPEA (4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol) was 28.6&#8201;% and 44.0&#8201;%, respectively. Compared with TS&#8208;1 and MCM&#8208;48 zeolite, the conversion rate of reactants and the selectivity of products have been significantly improved. The catalytic performance of TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 is derived from its well&#8208;crystallized microporous core and mesoporous shell with regular channels, which make active sites of TS&#8208;1 zeolite in the catalyst be fully utilized and mass transfer resistance be largely reduced. Further through theoretical calculation, we propose that the oxidation of PDEB is the result of the combination and mutual transformation of free radical process and carbocation process. Core&#8208;shell structure ensures the conversion rate of raw materials and improves the selectivity of products.

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the reaction of gold(I) hydrides with carbon dioxide was elucidated, revealing a one&#8211;step concerted mechanism leading to the formation of a formate product. A comparative ligand screening suggests that anionic/zwitterionic ligands should be employed experimentally for a successful implementation of a stoichiometric or catalytic reaction at the Au(I)&#8722;H site.







Abstract
We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8722; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8722;. We explored 20&#8197;different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8211;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.

         <title>Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular catalysts immobilised on mesoporous indium tin oxide (meso&#8208;ITO) electrodes are shown to be a promising candidate for the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The reactions proceed in acidic aqueous media to prevent competing substrate decomposition.







Abstract
Abundantly available biomass&#8208;based platform chemicals, including 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid&#8208;state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface&#8208;bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups. Screening experiments with HMF and further reaction intermediates revealed the catalytic route and bottlenecks in the catalytic synthesis of FDCA. Utilising these immobilised electrocatalysts, FDCA yields of up to 85&#8201;% and faradaic efficiencies of 91&#8201;% were achieved, without any indication of substrate decomposition. Surface analysis by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post&#8208;electrocatalysis unveiled the desorption of the catalyst from the electrode surface as a limiting factor in terms of catalytic performance.

         <title>Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite with Near&#8208;Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator&#8208;loaded nanomaterial (FURIN) for spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in the lymphatic system in&#8197;vivo. FURIN could be enriched in the lymph node (LN) of mice via subcutaneous injection and the mechanoluminescence (ML) of FURIN in the near&#8208;infrared region enables real&#8208;time, visualized feedback of FUS by bioimaging. FUS with high precision and deep penetration can activate dendritic cells (DCs) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN), is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in&#8197;vivo remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real&#8208;time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN in&#8197;vivo. The NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in the LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real&#8208;time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy in&#8197;vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size: A Key Parameter in Modulating Carbonyl Compound Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;functional group! Replacing oxygen in a carbonyl functional group for the larger, but less electronegative chalcogens, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the C=X group electronegativity in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960;HOMO&#8211;&#960;LUMO gap. This tunability of the properties of carbonyl compounds holds applications in many fields of chemistry, including supramolecular chemistry, organocatalysis, and photo(electro)chemistry.







Abstract
Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (i.&#8201;e., carbonyl) for the less electronegative Group 16 elements, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.

Replacing oxygen in a carbonyl functional group for the larger, but less electronegative chalcogens, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the C=X group electronegativity in &#960;-conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960;&lt;sub&gt;HOMO&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;&#960;&lt;sub&gt;LUMO&lt;/sub&gt; gap. This tunability of the properties of carbonyl compounds holds applications in many fields of chemistry, including supramolecular chemistry, organocatalysis, and photo(electro)chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (&lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;., carbonyl) for the less electronegative Group 16 elements, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;-conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum-chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208; and Oxygen&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Nanographene with Circularly Polarised Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B, O&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographene has been explored for its optical and chiroptical properties. The presence of helical and nanographene segments stabilize the helicity and imparts tunable optical properties. Helical nanographene display circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes have garnered substantial attention owing to their finely adjustable optical and semiconducting properties. The strategic integration of both helicity and heteroatoms into the nanographene structure, facilitated by a boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), elevates its photophysical and chiroptical features. This signifies the introduction of an elegant category of helical nanographene that combines optical (TADF) and chiroptical (CPL) features. In this direction, we report the synthesis, optical, and chiroptical properties of boron, oxygen&#8208;doped &#928;&#8208;extended helical nanographene. The &#960;&#8208;extension induces distortion in the DOBNA&#8208;incorporated nanographene, endowing a pair of helicenes, (P)&#8208;B2NG, and (M)&#8208;B2NG exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with glum of &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and +2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. B2NG exhibited MR&#8208;TADF with a lifetime below 5 &#956;s, and a reasonably high fluorescence quantum yield (50&#8201;%). Our molecular design enriches the optical and chiroptical properties of nanographenes and opens up new opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.

         <title>Impact of Endcap Molecules on Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Oligomers in Structural Color Stability and Hypsochromic Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive structurally colored coatings are created using endcapped cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. Newly synthesized and commercially available endcapping molecules are employed to terminate the liquid crystal oligomers. The impact of the endcap molecules in the oligomers on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift was studied. Commercial endcapping molecules were found to produce unstable coatings, while the new endcapped molecules led to stable coatings with reversible thermochromic behavior, making them intriguing for advanced optical applications.







Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers are an interesting class of temperature responsive structurally colored materials. However, the role of endcap molecules in these oligomers is rather unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the role of endcap molecules on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift in temperature&#8208;responsive cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. First, new liquid crystal monoacrylate endcap molecules are synthesized, which are then used to synthesize various cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. In addition, cholesteric oligomers using commercial monoacrylate endcap molecules are also prepared. It is found that the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the oligomers can be tuned by the endcapping molecules. The oligomers are used to produce reflective, structurally colored coatings. It was found that the coatings using the commercial monoacrylate lose their color and crystallize over time, most likely due to the presence of crystalline dimers. The coatings containing the newly synthesized monoacrylate endcap molecules did not exhibit this crystallization, resulting in structurally colored coatings that remained stable over time. These latter coatings possessed temperature responsive hypochromic behavior, which makes them interesting for advanced optical applications.

         <title>Bi(III) Binding Stoichiometry and Domain&#8208;Specificity Differences Between Apo and Zn(II)&#8208;bound Metallothionein 1a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine&#8208;rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two&#8208;domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal&#8208;loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI&#8208;MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; binding to apo&#8208;MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; was added to apo&#8208;MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo&#8208;MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Detecting protein&#8208;ligand interactions with nitroxide based paramagnetic cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy&#8208;to&#8208;use NMR method for studying protein&#8208;ligand interactions is presented, relying on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements induced by soluble nitroxide molecules. The NMR method can be useful for detecting changes of the electrostatic potential of proteins triggered by ligand binding and for detecting the location of ligand binding sites.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.

         <title>Energy Transfer on Cytoskeleton of Red Blood Cell Ghosts and their Efficiency Control by KCl Concentration&#8208;induced Cell Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a cytoskeleton network located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer. Their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as platforms for bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer using red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs) as scaffolds, relying on their asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer&#8217;s group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed tandem asymmetric reactions were powerful tools to access various chiral compounds. Many strategies have been developed for the coupling of 1,n&#8208;dienes with aryl halides via a tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8208;Trost process. However, the control of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemistry remains a challenging task.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Bicarbazoles by Sequential Iron(III)&#8208; and Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling Reactions

Domino Iron and Palladium Catalysis: An elegant synthetic approach to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles via activation of six C&#8722;H bonds is described. The strategy consists of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative homocoupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls followed by a twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls and subsequent twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization provide a convergent synthetic route to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles. Screening a range of different palladium(II) salts led to palladium(II) acetate, pivalate, and hexafluoroacetylacetonate as the most efficient catalysts. Remarkably, the twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization can also be performed under argon. The mechanism for the oxidative cyclization under an inert gas presumably involves regeneration of the catalytically active palladium(II) species by oxidative addition of pivalic acid.

         <title>Electrophilic Functionalization of a Hexaphosphabenzene Ligand in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8208;P6)]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] with main group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is explored. These studies yield novel cationic derivatives of the isolobal P homolog of the ubiquitous benzene ligand, featuring group 14, 15, and 16 as well as mixed group 14/16 element substituents.







Abstract
The electrophilic functionalization of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] (A) and its mono&#8208;oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)][SbF6] (B) with reactive main&#8208;group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is shown to be a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphosphabenzene ligand. Depending on the electrophile used, the regioselectivity of the functionalization can be adjusted. Using group 16 electrophiles, the trisubstituted compounds [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,3&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;2&#8208;Br&#8208;P3)}][TEF] (1), [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;(EPh)3&#8208;P3)][SbF6] (E=S (2), Se (3)) as well as the side product [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;P4)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(SPh)2)][SbF6] (4) are obtained. By switching to phosphenium ions as group 15 electrophiles, the ring&#8208;inserted products [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P7R2)][TEF] (R=Cy (5), iPr (6)) are isolated, showing an unprecedented P7R2 structural motif. Furthermore, the reaction with MeOTf yields the dimeric [{Cp*Mo}4(1,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;&#956;4,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P6)(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)2][TEF]2 (7) as the first example of a complex featuring two interconnected cyclo&#8208;P6 middle deck ligands. Finally, by combination of the methylation step with Ph2Se2, the mixed group 14/16 complex [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;11,2&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;P3)}][OTf] (8) is obtained.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrophilic functionalization of the triple-decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6:6&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and its mono-oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6:6&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) with reactive main-group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is shown to be a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphosphabenzene ligand. Depending on the electrophile used, the regioselectivity of the functionalization can be adjusted. Using group 16 electrophiles, the trisubstituted compounds [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&lt;/sup&gt;-1,3-(SePh)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-2-Br-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}][TEF] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&lt;/sup&gt;-1,2,3-(EPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (E=S (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Se (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;)) as well as the side product [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;4:4&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&lt;/sup&gt;-P(SPh)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) are obtained. By switching to phosphenium ions as group 15 electrophiles, the ring-inserted products [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)][TEF] (R=Cy (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;)) are isolated, showing an unprecedented P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structural motif. Furthermore, the reaction with MeOTf yields the dimeric [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(1,4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#956;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][TEF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) as the first example of a complex featuring two interconnected cyclo-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; middle deck ligands. Finally, by combination of the methylation step with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the mixed group 14/16 complex [{Cp*Mo}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&lt;/sup&gt;1,2-(SePh)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-3-Me-P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}][OTf] (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Symmetrically Substituted Poly(3,4&#8208;Dimethylthiophene) as Cathode for Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addressing the stability challenges in aluminum ion batteries, this research employs poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT) as a cathode material. Innovatively modifying the thiophene ring with methyl groups, PDMT adjusts local charge density and electron delocalization, boosting electrochemical reactivity and cycling stability. Exhibiting an exceptional discharge capacity of 110 mAh g&#8208;1 and maintaining 92.7% capacity after 1000 cycles, PDMT outperforms traditional polythiophene cathodes.







Abstract
The aggravation of energy problems and the scarcity of lithium resources have forced us to look for new energy storage systems. Aluminum ion batteries, as a promising energy storage system, have the advantages of environmental friendliness and abundant aluminum resources, and have the potential for application in large&#8208;scale energy storage and personal portable electronic devices. To solve the stability problem of aluminum ion batteries during cycling for large&#8208;scale energy storage needs, we report a polythiophene&#8208;based conductive polymer, poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT), as a high performance cathode material for aluminum ion batteries. By introducing two methyl groups on the thiophene ring, we successfully adjust the local charge density of the heterocyclic thiophene, thus changing the electron delocalization characteristics, and improving the electrochemical reaction activity of the polythiophene (PTH) material as a redox electrode material. This also maintains the symmetry and regularity of the polymer structure, giving the material better cycling stability. The discharge specific capacity reaches 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, far exceeding conventional PTH cathodes (~70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and the capacity retention rate is 92.7&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. It also shows excellent rate performance due to the flexible structure of the conductive polymer.

         <title>Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape&#8208;shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic valence isomerism of a bullvalene unit is tamed in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 chelate complex with Ag+, such that the bullvalene unit in the chelating ligand contains one predominant isomer at 5&#8201;&#176;C. In turn, in this completely reversible process, displacement of Ag+ from the complex with hexacyclene unleashes the dynamic interconversions of the bullvalene.







Abstract
In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene&#8208;bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with Ag+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Most importantly, detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag+ strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed 1H&#8208;NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.&#8201;e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and preparation of biomass&#8208;derived porous carbon materials in recent five years was summarized. These carbon materials were briefly catalogized into two types, plant&#8208;derived and animal&#8208;derived carbon materials. Heteroatoms doping was illustrated with an emphasis on single&#8208;element doping and multi&#8208;element doping, respectively. The advantages of these porous carbon materials applicated in electrochemical energy storage devices, such as LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, and SCs were reviewed. The remaining challenges and prospects in the field were outlined.







Abstract
The environmental impact from the waste disposal has been widely concerned around the world. The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein and lignin are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high&#8208;specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom&#8208;doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The challenges and prospects for the controllable synthesis and large&#8208;scale application of biomass&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials have also been outlooked.

Because of its large specific surface area and numerous active sites, GA has been widely used in the field of electrochemistry. In this study, liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;modified graphene aerogels were fabricated and used to construct a flexible sensor for the first time. The good performance of the resulting sensor offers the potential for the practical application of flexible sensors.







Abstract
Graphene aerogel (GA) has important application potential as piezoresistive sensors due to its low density, high conductivity, high porosity, and good mechanical properties. However, the fabrication of GA&#8208;based sensors with good mechanical properties and excellent sensing performance is still challenging. Herein, liquid&#8208; metal&#8208;modified GAs (GA/LM) are proposed for the development of an excellent GA&#8208;based sensor. GA/LM with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected layered structure exhibits excellent compressive stress of 41&#8197;KPa and fast response time (&lt;20&#8197;ms). While generally flexible GA composites cannot be compressed beyond 80&#8201;% strain without plastic deformation, GA/LM demonstrates a high compressive strength of 60&#8197;kPa under a strain of 90&#8201;%. A real&#8208;time pressure sensor was fabricated based on GA/LM&#8208;2 to monitor swallowing, pulse beating, finger, wrist and knee bending, and even plantar pressure during walking. These excellent features enable potential applications in health detection.

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.







Abstract
Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. The limitation is attributed to the synthetic difficulty of accessing functionalized polyamines. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose silver(III) fluoride. Access to the first silver(III) carbene complexes has been achieved by reaction of the fluoride [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] precursor with different imidazolium salts. The novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. This synthetic procedure is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303937).

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Methanol to Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Iron Complex with N3S3&#8208;type Tripodal Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripodal ligand, which has two reversible Fe2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox couples in solution in CV, exhibited catalytic oxidation of CH3OH to HCHO under O2, which was studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically.







Abstract
A Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripod ligand, 1, reacts with O2 in CH3OH to generate formaldehyde, which has been studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically. Complex&#8197;1 crystallizes as an octahedral structure with crystallographic C3 symmetry around the metal, with Fe&#8208;N=2.2917(17) &#197; and Fe&#8208;S=2.3574(6) &#197;. UV&#8208;vis spectrum of 1 in CH3OH under Ar shows an intense band at 572&#8197;nm (&#1013; 4,100&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1), which shifts to 590&#8197;nm (&#1013; 2,860&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1) by the addition of O2, and a new peak appeared at 781&#8197;nm (&#1013; 790&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1). Such a spectral change is not observed in CH2Cl2. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 in CH2Cl2 under Ar gives reversible redox waves assigned to Fe2+/Fe3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples at &#8722;1.60&#8197;V (&#916;E=69&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=71&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+, respectively. In contrast, in CH3OH, the reversible redox waves, albeit accompanied by a positive shift of the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple, are observed at &#8722;1.20&#8197;V (&#916;E=85&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=64&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+ under Ar. Interestingly, a catalytic current was observed for the CV of 1 in CH3OH in the presence of CH3ONa under Ar, when the sweep rate was slowed down.

         <title>Achieving Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitable Blue TADF&#8208;Type Afterglow via Delicate Control of Excited States in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>

In contrast to blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials that require UVB excitation, this study reports visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems.







Abstract
Blue afterglow constitutes of one of the primary afterglow colors and can convert into other afterglow colors through energy transfer. The reported studies show the fabrication of blue afterglow emitters, but most of them are formed by room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence mechanism and require UVB lights as excitation source (these high&#8208;energy lights may damage organic systems). Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence type (TADF&#8208;type) afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. Tiny change of the substituents in BF2bdk system has been found to pose significant influence on excited state energy levels and consequently narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy of the system. As a result, both forward and reverse intersystem crossing have been accelerated, leading to the emergence of BF2bdk's TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in rigid crystalline matrices. The resultant TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials exhibit emission lifetimes of several hundred milliseconds, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.7&#8201;% and display temperature responsive property.

         <title>Characterization and In Vitro Behavior of PEO Coated Mg Modified with Antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg gained significant attention as a candidate for implant materials. However, its use is limited due to corrosion process and pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The use of Mg&#8208;based biomaterials with a number of their advantageous properties are overshadowed by uncontrollable metal corrosion. Moreover, the use of implants goes alongside with the threat of pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity. To achieve a suitable level of anticorrosion protection phosphate and fluoride&#8208;phosphate electrolytes are used in the PEO process. Investigation of the surface thickness and morphology done by means of cross&#8208;section analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay show precedence of the fluoride containing PEO coating and make it the material of choice for further modification with Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes. The presence of the complexes on the PEO surface is confirmed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) are used to estimate the complexes&#8217; chemical state and depth of penetration in the coating surface. Based on the results of antibacterial assay, the modified coatings are found to be active against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deconstructing for understanding: A structure&#8208;activity relationship study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors shed new lights on the contribution of chelation and statistical rebinding mechanisms underlying high multivalent effect in glycosidase inhibition. This experimental&#8211;theoretical approach provides insights from various dimensions (statistical, stoichiometric, electrostatics) and relevant guidelines for the design of optimized multivalent enzyme inhibitors.







Abstract
Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Epoxidation of Cyclooctene on Surface Modified Ni Foam Using Water as Oxygen Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic strategy for highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene to the corresponding epoxide is demonstrated using Ni foam as electrocatalyst using water as the oxygen source. By controlling the hydrophobicity of the Ni foam surface the conversion of cyclooctene was substantially increased.







Abstract
Electrochemical epoxidation of olefins using water as an oxygen atom source is emerging as an alternative approach for an atom economic and sustainable method towards a highly selective synthesis of epoxides. We report an electrochemical procedure for epoxidation of cyclooctene using water as the sole oxygen atom source over a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) modified nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. The SDS modification facilitates the mass transfer of cyclooctene towards the anode, thus achieving a 2.5&#8208;fold higher conversion with more than 90&#8201;% selectivity towards the corresponding epoxide compared with pure Ni(OH)2 catalyst.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fully enantioselective catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin employs polyene cyclization chemistry with a novel, regioselective terminator. The ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;transport studies demonstrate independence of iron uptake and morphogenic activity, suggesting the Fe(III)&#8208;complex of thallusin being of importance primarily for compound resorption.







Abstract
A fully enantioselective, catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin using polyene cyclization chemistry is reported. The synthesis features dedicated precursor design, introduction of a TMS&#8208;substituted arene as a regioselective terminator, very high enantiomer excess (ee) on gram scale, and productive scaffold functionalization. Furthermore, an ee determination methodology of thallusin samples was developed, and the ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;uptake studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of iron facilitated by thallusin derivatives was independent of their morphogenic activity, suggesting their active import via siderophore transporters as a shuttle system.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped Diamane Sheets: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe) can be introduced into diamane in a specific pattern. This process not only enhances the adsorption properties of the reactant but also optimizes the CO2 conversion reaction pathway and promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction. Overall, transition metal&#8208;doped diamane demonstrates promising potential in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8722;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane, and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to be from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane&#8208;based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Oxidation of Unprotected Aminoglycosides and Sugar Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of amino groups and phosphates in aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates allows direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation without the use of protecting groups. The site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin allowed the preparation of a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two show promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of complex biomolecules by transition metal&#8208;catalysis is highly warranted, but often thwarted by the presence of Lewis basic functional groups. This study demonstrates that protonation of amines and phosphates in carbohydrates circumvents catalyst inhibition in palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation. Both aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates, compound classes that up till now largely escaped direct modification, are oxidized with good efficiency. Site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin was used to prepare a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two showed promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of composites involving TiO2 nanoparticles supported on the Ti2C MXene is investigated by means first&#8208;principles calculations. The analysis of the structural, bonding, and electronic properties confirms the stability of these composites which may have implication in catalysis. The stability of the composites arises favorable interaction between the two components, involving significant charge transfer from the MXene surface to the (TiO2)n (n=5,10) clusters. The present findings provide a reference that can be useful in the design of these composites.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n=5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.

         <title>Structural insights into the semiquinone form of human Cytochrome P450 reductase by DEER distance measurements between a native flavin and a spin labelled non&#8208;canonical amino acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring dynamics is crucial for understanding Cytochrome P450 Reductase's electron transfer pathway. We innovatively studied its one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced state using non&#8208;canonical amino acid and a semi&#8208;reduced flavin. This novel approach enabled distance measurement by Double Electron Electron Resonance on this specific redox state for the first time. Together with Molecular Dynamics studies, we showed the existence of an ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; state of the protein.







Abstract
The flavoprotein Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is the unique electron pathway from NADPH to Cytochrome P450 (CYPs). The conformational dynamics of human CPR in solution, which involves transitions from a &#8220;locked/closed&#8221; to an &#8220;unlocked/open&#8221; state, is crucial for electron transfer. To date, however, the factors guiding these changes remain unknown. By Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we have incorporated a non&#8208;canonical amino acid onto the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains of soluble human CPR, and labelled it with a specific nitroxide spin probe. Taking advantage of the endogenous FMN cofactor, we successfully measured for the first time, the distance distribution by DEER between the semiquinone state FMNH&#8226; and the nitroxide. The DEER data revealed a salt concentration&#8208;dependent distance distribution, evidence of an &#8220;open&#8221; CPR conformation at high salt concentrations exceeding previous reports. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations which unveiled a diverse ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; semiquinone state of the CPR at high salt concentration. This study unravels the conformational landscape of the one electron reduced state of CPR, which had never been studied before.

         <title>Controlling the Activation at NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; Moieties through Lewis Acid Interactions in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nickel&#8208;carbonite complexes the degree of CO2 activation depends on the nature of the alkali metal counterion, the strength of its interaction with the carbonite unit &#8211; and thus its spacial separation &#8211; as well as on further polar entities in the second coordination sphere. This is also reflected in the reactivity towards electrophiles which lead to C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Nickel complexes with a two&#8208;electron reduced CO2 ligand (CO22&#8722;, &#8220;carbonite&#8221;) are investigated with regard to the influence alkali metal (AM) ions have as Lewis acids on the activation of the CO2 entity. For this purpose complexes with NiII(CO2)AM (AM=Li, Na, K) moieties were accessed via deprotonation of nickel&#8208;formate compounds with (AM)N(iPr)2. It was found that not only the nature of the AM ions in vicinity to CO2 affect the activation, but also the number and the ligation of a given AM. To this end the effects of added (AM)N(R)2, THF, open and closed polyethers as well as cryptands were systematically studied. In 14 cases the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and correlations with the situation in solution were made. The more the AM ions get detached from the carbonite ligand, the lower is the degree of aggregation. At the same time the extent of CO2 activation is decreased as indicated by the structural and spectroscopic analysis and reactivity studies. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the coordinating AM Lewis acidic fragment withdraws only a small amount of charge from the carbonite moiety, but it also affects the internal charge equilibration between the LtBuNi and carbonite moieties.

         <title>Gas Evolution as a Tool to Study Reaction Kinetics Under Biomimetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of bioorthogonal chemistry is rapidly growing, presenting successful applications of organic and transition metal catalysed reactions in cells and living systems (in vivo). The development of such reactions typically proceeds through many iterative steps focused on biocompatibility and fast reaction kinetics to ensure product formation. However, obtaining kinetic data, even under simulated biological (biomimetic) conditions, remains a challenge due to substantial concentrations of salts and biomolecules hampering the use of typically employed solution&#8208;phase analytical techniques. In this study, we explored the suitability of gas evolution as a probe to study kinetics under biomimetic conditions. As proof of concept, we show that the progress of two transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored, regardless of the complexity of the medium. As such, we introduce a protocol to gain more insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions to further progress iterative catalyst development for&#160;in vivo&#160;applications</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Inorganic Core of a reduced Ni2Ge2 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetranuclear cores (M&#8211;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII = Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8211;M and E&#8211;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8211;E)2 core can be finely tuned. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in vitro as well as in vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Late&#8208;Stage Chemoselective Photocatalytic Removal of Sulfonyl and Phenacyl Groups in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5 mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8208;Halloysite Bio&#8208;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8208;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88% and 39%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8208;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8208;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8211;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X = F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 &#160;(4) (ADCH = PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH = 2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8211;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61 kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3:1, 3:2 or 6:1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1:2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3:1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Induced Oligomerization of Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Phenylazothiazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometry of the molecules plays important role in various chemical and physical properties. Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes from a stable isomer (trans) to a geometrically different less stable structure (cis) by light irradiation through isomerization. Here an unconventional phenomenon is reported where a cis isomer undergo oligomerization in the absence of light, however, behave as typical photoswitches in the presence of light irradiation.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n&#8807;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adducts formed by OsO4 and Lewis bases, have already been rationalised as &#963;&#8208;hole based adducts. The interaction involving Osmium as electrophilic site is named Osme Bond (Omb). Here, new adducts with OmB interaction were characterized. Computations confirm a strong correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and geometric deformation of OsO4.







Abstract
Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also, some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.

         <title>Switchable Redox and Thermo&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Based on Cyclodextrin&#8208;Polyoxometalate Tandem</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic behavior of polyoxometalates is exploited as an operating principle to promote a reversible and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polymer where supramolecular networking results from the host&#8208;guest interactions between cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. This study reveals that the chaotropic effect corresponds to an effective force able to induce responsiveness into supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.

         <title>Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of combining molecular hourglass with anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for mimicking the shape and function of the ClC chloride channel selective pore is presented. High and regulatable chloride transport conductance and selectivity that replicate the properties demonstrated by ClC is achieved through modifying the constituent components of the molecular hourglass.







Abstract
ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.

         <title>Selectively transport and removal of fluoride ion by pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride contamination of groundwater has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Currently, excessive absorption of fluoride can be toxic to humans and crops. To address the challenge, we explored the excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer framework. By constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, the pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane achieves a fluoride removal.







Abstract
Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials.

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical characterization of a pH&#8208;sensitive quadracyclic uridine (qU) analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the synthesis and detailed photophysical characterization of qU &#8211; a novel fluorescent base analogue of uridine. qU exhibits interesting properties such as excitation in the visible region with high brightness, dual emission, pH sensitivity, and an ESPT reaction. This work has extended the toolbox of internal RNA labels for future applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27&#8201;% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.

         <title>Electroplated electrodes for continuous and mass&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (ECH) receive growing attention due to their sustainable potential. Our innovative one&#8208;step protocol creates carbon&#8208;supported silver electrodes, finely tunable for morphology and catalytic activity. Achieving 93&#8201;% current efficiency in ECH for the vitamin synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, even at higher current densities and reduced metal loadings, we successfully converted a library of 17&#8197;diverse substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by U.&#8208;P. Apfel, D. Siegmund and co&#8208;workers (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303808).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one&#8208;step binder&#8208; and additive&#8208;free production of silver&#8208; and copper&#8208;electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for the tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A&#8208; and E&#8208;synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single&#8208;pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium&#8208;based thermocatalytic state of the art.

Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A- and E-synthon 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kg&lt;sub&gt;MBE&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single-pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kg&lt;sub&gt;MBE&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium-based thermocatalytic state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Action Plots Reveal Red&#8208;shifted Wavelength&#8208;dependent Photoproduct Distributions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical action plots are used to deconvolute the wavelength&#8208;selective photoreactivity of a single chromophore. Remarkably, by irradiating with different monochromatic wavelengths of light, either the trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;isomerization or the [2+2]&#8208;photocyclisation can be selectively triggered.







Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene acts like an intelligent robot to efficiently regulate drug loading and release. Nanogold is widely used and shows advantages in oncology treatment; however, it cannot encapsulate drugs directly and effectively like other nanovesicles or nanocages. The modified pillar[5]arenecan endowed nanogold with excellent drug&#8208;loading ability through a simple host&#8211;guest interaction, and successfully achieved the combination of DOX and GOX for cancer therapy. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400007).

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols has been realized in an acylation reaction catalyzed by a supramolecular catalyst consisting of an enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsule and an achiral guest possessing a catalytic center. The enantioselective acylation proceeds at the exterior of a supramolecular catalyst. The cover picture represents the catalytic center of the supramolecular catalyst that accelerates the acylation of either enantiomer, resulting in the successful kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304244).

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several strategies abound to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors is relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. &#160;Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8208;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of&#160;Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Temperature&#8208;Tolerant Magnesium&#8208;Ion Battery Using Ball Cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as High&#8208;Performance Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode for rechargable magnesium&#8208;ion batteries, which displays a good electrochemical performance. After cycling 300 times, the capacity and Coulombic efficiency keep stable, which are ascribed to ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion.







Abstract
Safe and high&#8208;performance secondary batteries using for all&#8208;climate conditions with different temperatures are highly required. Here, we develop a three&#8208;dimensional ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode material for magnesium&#8208;ion (Mg&#8208;ion) batteries. After cycling 300 times, the capacity maintains 111.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while Coulombic efficiency stabilizes at about 100&#8201;%. Under temperatures of 45&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C, the capacities remain stable after 200 cycles. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance tests, the capacity keeps quite stable. It is ascribed to the ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion, which has been verified by constant&#8208;current intermittent titration technology. It is believed that the good performance enables the Mg&#8208;ion batteries to have a all&#8208;climate capability.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Free &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids through One Pot C&#8208;H Activation/C&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H activation/C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of novel spirocyclic &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids, is reported. This approach shows wide substrate scope of CF3&#8208;ynones and ketimines. In addition, several natural products and biologically relevant molecules, prepared by this method, can be further functionalized. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures can be successfully assembled with this spirocyclic amino acid.







Abstract
The first synthesis of unnatural &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with a spirocyclic backbone by one&#8208;pot protocol has been presented. This reaction features wide functional group tolerance and feasibility of post&#8208;functionalization of natural products and biologically important molecules. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures were assembled using this newly developed &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acid in high efficiency. The combination of C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids would trigger more promising synthetic routes for this compound.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>

Electrode/electrolyte interface built by the dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB enables significant improvement on the cycling stability of hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell.







Abstract
Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3&#8197;M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17&#8201;% (baseline) to 79&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB) and 83&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5Phosphinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E. coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate was converted into AMFC by E. coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81% yield, together with 10% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41 g/L h productivity and 8.6 g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10 mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and Trifluoromethoxy Sulfur Pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) &#8211; Two Gaseous Sulfur(VI) Compounds with Insulating Properties</title>

         <dc:description>In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxidefor Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent and atom economic nitrosating agent. The preparation of N2O3 is difficult due to its instability and entangled chemical and phase equilibria. This review reexamines the preparative methods of pure N2O3 and its concentrated (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) solutions via a phase equilibrium approach in combination with worked examples in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review,the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel=Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New family of direct band gap semiconductors. The new compound Na3In2P3 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.27&#8197;eV and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional polyanionic framework of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. Additionally, the related phosphidotrielates Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2 and Na3InP2, which are all built up by triel phosphorus tetrahedra as well, have been proven to be semiconductors as well, with direct band gaps ranging from of 1.37&#8197;eV to 2.45&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45&#8197;eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#8197;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99&#8197;eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#8197;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#8197;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E=In and vertices as well as edges for E=Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.

         <title>Towards Amplified Probing of Weak Intermolecular Interactions on the External Surfaces of Molecular Capsules</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive equilibria between homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsular complexes reveal unexpected variations in the aryl&#8208;aryl interactions of eight benzoyl fragments grouped in four tight pairs on the outer surfaces of the capsules.







Abstract
We report a sensitive method for comparing weak interactions between aryl rings located on the external surfaces of equilibrating homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsules. Two identical self&#8208;complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl3 hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pair wise mixing of six different homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo&#8208; or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl&#8208;aryl attractions in the hetero&#8208; or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four&#8208;fold amplification of weak aryl&#8208;aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for high sensitiveness of our approach.

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;controlled pH variations enabled by the decarboxylation of nitroacetic acid are transduced into time&#8208;controlled voltage variations. Such variations are exploited to govern the operation of simple electric devices.







Abstract
The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8208;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8208;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins (doSTXs), dd&#8208;doSTX (2), 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (4) and doSTX (5) were synthesized, and 2, 3, and 5 were identified in the toxin&#8208;producing marine dinoflagellates and a freshwater cyanobacterium. In addition, conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 by SxtT with VanB was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a biosynthetic precursor of STX (1), and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylation proceed after cyclization in STX biosynthesis.







Abstract
Saxitoxin (STX, 1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX, 2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella, A. pacificum, and/or Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum circinale (TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate G. catenatum, was also identified in D. circinale (TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis, was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.

         <title>Computational study into the oxidative ring&#8208;closure mechanism during the biosynthesis of deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8208;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and byproducts we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA&#450;&#160;Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities&#160;for the continuous valorisation of bio&#8208;feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of [1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes through Iodine&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8211;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N&#9679;&#8211;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5 mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps ($\Delta E_{ST}$), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to $\Delta E_{ST}$ values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules.&#160; By integrating rigorous computational analysis, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;Donor Functionalized Aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives: Synthesis and Photophysical Study by Using Transient Optical Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (Benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8722;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs = 710 nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs = 685 nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F = 0.2&#8722;0.7% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F = 27% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916; = 0.3&#8722;1.5%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T = 53.2 &#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T = 114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. &#160;These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Keto&#8208;Sulfoxides from Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8208;80% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem-difluorinated keto-sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14-80% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE's VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting optoelectronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8208;Cs; Tt=Si&#8208;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8208; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8208;&#160;&#160;or [Tt2P6]10&#8208; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8208; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57eV.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>
