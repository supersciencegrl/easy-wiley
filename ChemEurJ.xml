         <title>Red&#8208;light Responsive Fluorescent Liposomes for Controlled Release&#160; of Carbon monoxide (CO) with Cytotoxic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signalling molecule. CO&#8208;releasing molecules/materials (CORMs) have been studied as a source of CO for therapeutic abilities. In this study, new fluorescent turn&#8208;on CO&#8208;releasing nanoscale liposomes are formulated and their CO&#8208;releasing potentials are studied under red light (625 nm).&#160; New amphiphilic fluorescent naphthalic anhydride appended with a manganese carbonyl complex (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM) has been reported for the red light controlled release of CO with fluorescent turn&#8208;on emission.&#160; To enhance the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of Nap&#8208;BpyCORM, we incorporated it with bilayer phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol to form nanoscale liposomes. The red&#8208;light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing ability of the liposomes was investigated by UV&#8208;vis, emission, and IR studies and myoglobin assay. The rate of CO release (t1/2 = 11.13 min) was observed to be slower in the case of the liposome that contains cholesterol (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves.1) compared to the liposome (t1/2 = 6.96 min) that only has DPPC (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves). Incorporation of cholesterol into liposomes has increased the stability of CORMs. New liposomes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, but in the presence of light, they show toxicity to cancer cells.&#160;These findings open new avenues for the development of light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing compounds with improved biocompatibility and applicability in various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction using polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially under low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator&#160;of TMSD reaction.&#160;We show that PQ2 could&#160;drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold.&#160;Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with&#160;sub&#8208;nanomolar&#160;input has been successfully demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic amplifiers.&#160;By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations,&#160;PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar&#8208;level inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining a desired single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer TMSD circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes.&#160;The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications&#160;from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Guest Molecules Containing Rich&#8208;electron Group Incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the Enhancement of Iodine Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest molecules with rich&#8208;electron groups are successfully incorporated into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF to obtain two composites, which exhibit higher iodine uptake capacities than the pristine one. The iodine adsorption kinetics and possible adsorption mechanism by these above mentioned materials are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the major iodine species of iodine&#8208;loaded complexes are also characterized.







Abstract
Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL=(R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them were 1448 and 1680&#8197;mg/g at 75&#8201;&#176;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4&#8197;times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept highlights our efforts to develop efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange methods, directing the controllable syntheses and structural determinations of more than 200 metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters, also known as ultrasmall nanoparticles, represent a promising class of nanomaterials due to their atomically precise characterizations and intriguing chemical&#8208;physical properties. The preparation is the cornerstone for advancing the nanocluster science, facilitating their structural determination, property investigation, and practical application. We have been devoted to exploring new and efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties. We have proposed and developed four methodologies for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure&#8208;property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with several feasible synthetic routes.

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene produces a [Sn4]4&#8211; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5p orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5p orbital on tin.







Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;=[O(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;, Dipp=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in benzene afforded K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[(Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;){Al(NON)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4-[Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital, such that spin-orbit contributions to the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Construction of a Pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b] Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Smart AIE Material: A Theoretical Insight into Fluorescence Switching Mechanism of the Chimeric Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explored a chimeric design strategy to integrate bisthienylethene into a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3] benzothiazole AIEgen (PBTE) as the head group. The ultrafast intramolecular FRET which outcompetes the nonradiative decay was identified as the dominant channel for fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. The excellent AIE photoswitching capability enabled its applications in erasable optical memory and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8211;MS Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Analytical characterization of homo and co&#8208;polyesters: We have engineered a cutinase from T. cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) to improve its thermostability and catalytic performance and applied it along with the LCCWCCG enzyme to carry out the chemoselective hydrolysis of aromatic/aliphatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. An analytical workflow based on RPLC&#8208;UV&#8208;MS and SEC&#8208;MS provided insight into the monomer selectivity in the hydrolysis of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91&#8201;&#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo&#8208;polyesters. SEC&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co&#8208;polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end&#8208;group composition. These results underline the importance of co&#8208;polymer composition in the biodegradation of co&#8208;polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4&#8208;stabilizing agents for drug development.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;Tm values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT&#8208;8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives as selective G4&#8208;stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.

         <title>Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral CYCNOLs have been developed. The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.

The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;-positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi-sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;-positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2-dioxide under catalysis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-cyclic [1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-2,2&#8242;-diol/ZnMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4-phenyl-4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one with 2-arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indole with cyclic 2,4-dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;-substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;-positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi-sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D multi&#8208;layered sulfur sheets from 0D sulfur dots with improved crystallinity, effective light harvesting, less exciton binding energy with effective free charge carriers separation for efficient photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co&#8208;catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending &#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide the straightforward synthesis of new azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. These experimental findings were further supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, providing valuable insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960; system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X&#8208;ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.

         <title>New Cytotoxic Derivatives by the Phosphorylation and Phosphinoylation of Diethyl &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Methylphosphonates</title>

In order to make available potentionally bioactive new &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were phosphorylated, phosphinoylated and thiophosphinoylated with the corresponding P&#8208;chloride. The effect of a P=O to P=S modification was evaluated by single crystal X&#8208;ray cristallography. Among the phosphorylated and phosphinoylated aminophosphonates a few derivatives revealed moderate cytotoxic effect.







Abstract
In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

The reactivity of group 13 anions of the form [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene, E=Al, Ga, In) towards Fe(CO)5 has been investigated. In the case of the aluminyl system, both reaction outcome and product structure are highly sensitive to the availability of the potassium counterion; sequestration by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is necessary to yield a species featuring a direct, unsupported Al&#8722;Fe bond. 2.2.2&#8208;Cryptand, by contrast, yields a species featuring bridging carbonyl ligands, while the use of no sequestering agent at all leads to isocarbonyl bridging to aluminium. Owing to their lower oxophilicity, the heavier congeners gallium and indium more straightforwardly deliver Fe&#8722;E bonded adducts (E=Ga, In). The series of trielyl iron complexes has been interrogated by structural and computational analyses, as well as by IR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies, revealing a consistent shift in bond polarity and electron richness at iron as group 13 is descended. This in turn is consistent with the diminishing donor strength of the trielyl ligand with increasing atomic number.

         <title>Reversible Ring Oxidation of 48&#960; Planar Nonaphyrins to Open Shell 46&#960; dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of 48&#960; nonaphyrins, a novel class of planar expanded porphyrinoids exhibiting distinct redox properties compared to their 32&#960; congeners. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal a heterocycle dependent structural planar topology in these macrocycles. These nonaphyrins display weak paratropic ring current effects and undergo reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield the 46&#960; dicationic species. Unlike the 32&#960; congeners, these 46&#960; dications have been characterized as diradicalod in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Unsymmetric Azohetero&#8208;aromatic Radical Bridged Diruthenium(III) Set Up</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;((6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8208;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28 V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8208;1.05 V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2'&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step.

         <title>Working mechanisms for enhanced interface stability and electrochemical properties in dual&#8208;salt polymer electrolyte with in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8208;cathode integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li//Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000 h at at 0.1 mA cm&#8211;2@0.1 mAh cm&#8211;2. LiFePO4//Li full cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.5 C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90% at 0.5 C after 100 cycles) at 60 &#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ecofriendly synthesis of a hybrid hydrogel incorporating silver nanoparticles: Biological and photocatalytic activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid material comprising silver nanoparticles embedded within a 3D hydrogel network. The use of an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis as a natural reducing agent facilitates the synthesis process. Acanthus mollis is a perennial, invasive and leafy plant that is widely distributed across the planet. Sequential introduction of silver nitrate solution and the plant extract into the hydrogel yielded a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100 &#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites in porous aromatic frameworks via multivariate strategy for ReO4&#8208; capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radioactive waste discharge from nuclear facilities has attracted extensive attention on effective capture from used nuclear fuel. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized through a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and used for ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. Because these materials have varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8208; adsorption. PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98% of ReO4&#8208; within 2 min, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 707 mg g&#8208;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8208; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective radioactive waste disposal approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using&#160;Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900 cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10 ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14 &#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4 &#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287 cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D = 0.1001 cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.e. the efficient ISC is resulted, but triplet state lifetime become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Promoted Carbonylative Lactonization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of complexed molecules through intramolecular hydrogen bond to facilitate chemical reactions is an applicable strategy in organic synthesis. Among the lactones, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones is a class of biologically active and important structures. In this work, a series of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were synthesised in a green and efficient manner by carbonylation of alkenes. This reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of lactones containing natural product modules. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is imperative for enhancing the nucleophilicity of the large steric alcohol, which are challenge to lactonize. The existence of intramolecular hydrogen bond was proven with the aid of FT&#8208;IR and NMR characterisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Hetero&#8208;Bimetallic Azurin Photoenzyme for Photoredox Nitrite Reduction and SNO Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis in protein systems presents exciting opportunities to achieve sustainable and efficient enzymatic reactions driven by light. Here, we report the design and characterization of PhotoNiR, an engineered azurin&#8208;based protein incorporating a red copper center and a lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT). This dual&#8208;metal system enables photoredox reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide via a proposed donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism. Upon photoirradiation, aromatic residues in the LBT donate electrons to the lanthanide ion, which relays them to the Cu(II) center, reducing it to Cu(I). The reduced Cu(I)&#8208;PhotoNiR catalyzes the reduction of NO2&#8208;, and the generated NO subsequently reacts with free cysteine residues to form S&#8208;nitrosothiol (SNO) species. Spectroscopic and structural characterization confirmed that the copper center retains the properties of a red copper site and that the lanthanide&#8208;binding tag supports efficient electron transfer. This work represents one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A mechanism in a protein system, demonstrating the potential of integrating metalloprotein engineering with lanthanide photochemistry to develop novel photoenzymes for light&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of feedstock azine starting materials in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products has had a storied history that has resulted in some of the most efficient syntheses to date. The use of aromatic building blocks not only has economic value, but implicit synthetic advantages towards concise synthesis and accessing broader molecular diversity.







Abstract
Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pertechnetate and perrhenate auto&#8208;reduce, leading to coordination geometries suitable for polyoxometalate (POM) assembly. Evaporation of pertechnic acid leads to the prior&#8208;reported [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722;. Evaporation of perrhenic acid yields (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O, the first evidence for Re auto&#8208;reduction, prior known for the lighter group VII congeners. Combined perrhenate and pertechnetate yield the [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; polyanion, the first group VII mixed&#8208;metal POM.







Abstract
Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8722;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8722;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8722;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides and its Application in the Synthesis of Scleropentaside A, Scleropentaside B and the Derivatives of Dapagliflozin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides is developed through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling and isomerization, which is subsequently applied in the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glucosides and their derivatives demonstrate significant SGLT2 inhibitory activity, making them potential candidates for diabetes treatment.







Abstract
C&#8208;Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of O/N&#8208;glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross&#8208;coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base&#8208;assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of C&#8208;glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers: A New Concept for Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBPs, with a unique backbone entirely composed of bonded metal atoms, offer promising quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity. This Concept highlights their potential for the advanced thermoelectric materials, with recent progress, challenges, and future directions discussed.







Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.

         <title>Formal Umpolung Strategy for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Amides via &#945;&#8208;Sulfenylnitro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient umpolung strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;branched amides using nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents, and amines has been developed. This strategy utilizes only readily available reagents. Key advances include the one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitroalkanes, optimized oxidative amidation, and a demonstration of a wide substrate scope. In addition, the sulfenylnitro scaffold offers notable advantages in terms of reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Amide compounds are essential structural motifs found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides and materials. A novel formal umpolung strategy for an efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched amides was developed, employing nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents and amines as reacting components. The synthesis involves the formation of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro intermediates, which undergo oxidative amidation under optimized conditions using tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and K2CO3 as a base. The key intermediate, an &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro compound, was successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot operation. This methodology demonstrates a broad substrate scope, accommodating various amines, including primary and secondary amines as well as amino acid derivatives, and yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;branched amides in high efficiency. The sulfenyl nitro scaffold proved particularly effective, offering both stability and reactivity. The developed process simplifies the preparation of &#945;&#8208;branched amides and expands the accessible structural diversity.

We reported an efficient asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates for the construction of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles. A readily available chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(OTf)2 complex catalyst was identified to afford the corresponding products in good yields with high ee values. The stereospecific ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles enable the formation of glycinate&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates has been established. The reaction using a chiral nickel complex catalyst enabled the formation of a series of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee, &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) under mild reaction conditions. Ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindole leads to formation of glycinate&#8208;bearing oxindoles with retention of configuration.

&lt;p&gt;We reported an efficient asymmetric catalytic aza-Michael-initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosyloxycarbamates for the construction of spiro-aziridine oxindoles. A readily available chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-dioxide/Ni(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex catalyst was identified to afford the corresponding products in good yields with high ee values. The stereospecific ring-opening of spiro-aziridine oxindoles enable the formation of glycinate-substituted oxindole derivatives.

         <title>A Tetrazine&#8208;Based Synthesis for Accessing Underutilized Aza&#8208;Indole Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;indole functionalities fill an important role in drug discovery. While indoles are considered privileged scaffolds, aza&#8208;indoles allow for better pharmacological properties and on&#8208;target activities. Synthetic approaches to access aza&#8208;indoles are limited, with pyrazolopyridazines being some of the scarcest aza&#8208;indoles. To provide access to these underutilized cores, a synthetic approach utilizing a reaction cascade between a protected propargylhydrazine and dichlorotetrazine has been developed. In addition, a variety of methods were developed to access each position on the core for late&#8208;stage functionalization. This method offers an expedited synthetic route to a rare aza&#8208;indole scaffold with superior physiochemical properties when compared to indole analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Photophysical Path to the Triplet State in Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage (LOV) Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon blue&#8208;light absorption, LOV domains efficiently undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state. The efficiency of this ISC is&#160;said to arise from a&#160;heavy atom effect of the nearby (eventually adduct&#8208;forming) cysteine. However, LOV domain derivatives missing the cysteine residue still undergo ISC efficiently. Using hybrid multireference QM / MM&#160;models, we investigated the effect of the electrostatic environment in a prototypal LOV domain, AtLOV2, compared to the effect of the dielectric of an aqueous solution. We find that the electrostatic environment of AtLOV2 is especially well tuned to stabilize a triplet (nN,&#960;*) state, which we posit is the state driving ISC. Other low&#8208;lying triplet states that have (&#960;,&#960;*) and (nO,&#960;*) character are ruled out on the basis of energetics and / or orbital character. The mechanistic picture that emerges from the calculations is one that involves the ISC of photoexcited flavin to a (nN,&#960;*) state followed by rapid internal conversion to a triplet (&#960;,&#960;*) state, which is the state detected spectroscopically. This insight into the ISC mechanism provides guidelines for tuning flavin's photophysics through mutations that alter the protein electrostatic environment and potentially helps explain why ISC does not occur readily in many classes of flavin&#8208;binding enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Antimony Chloride with Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Solvent&#8208;Induced Property Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we synthesized two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN, which exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions with distinct optical properties influenced by the solvent environment. (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;DMF displays bright orange luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 57.1%, while (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN emits red luminescence with a PLQY of 17.4%. Notably, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#183;ACN achieves a maximum dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3, attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between organic and inorganic components. Reversible transformations between these two phases via solvent vapor stimulation enable dynamic photoluminescence (PL) switching, highlighting their application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. Furthermore, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting devices (CPL&#8208;emitting devices) based on these materials were fabricated, achieving a maximum |glum| of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8208;3. These findings underscore the potential of these chiral HMHs for advanced applications in chiral optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and CPL&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via A Novel Metal Ion&#8208;Modulation Approach: A Complementary Approach to Linker&#8208;Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP&#8208;MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal&#8208;ligand coordination and created the defect&#8208;mesopores during the solid&#8208;state transformation process, resulting in HP&#8208;MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP&#8208;MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing&#8208;linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP&#8208;MOFs. Beyond this, the metal modulators can be co&#8208;assembled into the HP&#8208;MOFs, functionalizing HP&#8208;MOFs with new metal active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of prepared hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Pd was tested, it presented superior catalytic activities towards hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small carbohydrates present a rich and complex conformational landscape whose accurate description is a significant challenge for computational molecular science, yet essential for understanding their physicochemical properties, biological roles, and medical implications. Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) is a notable example of a disaccharide that remains insufficiently characterized despite being implicated in the life&#8208;threatening anaphylactic response known as alpha&#8208;Gal syndrome. Here we present a thorough conformational analysis of &#945;&#8208;Gal using a unique combination of techniques, ranging from classical dynamics to a staged automatic conformer generation and screening using a quantum&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based protocol elaborated in the present work. The results reveal a remarkably constrained and rigid conformational profile that is minimally responsive to solvation. Subsequently, we study the binding of &#945;&#8208;Gal to the M86 antibody using multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations. Quantum mechanical analysis of the binding in terms of non&#8208;covalent interactions, local energy decomposition, and quantities derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enable us to identify and quantify the key interactions that form the structural basis of &#945;&#8208;Gal&#8217;s immunological response.</dc:description>

Pure oligosaccharide samples are crucial for studying these properties, and their preparation heavily relies on chemical synthesis. The linker used for attaching the oligosaccharide to the solid support is essential during solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. Here, we present three base&#8208;labile linkers compatible with Merrifield resin. The first type of resin, containing a hydroxyhexanoic acid linker, can be prepared in a one&#8208;step synthesis and releases glycans with a terminal carboxylic acid after methanolysis and hydrolysis. Linkers on the second and third types of resin can be synthesized through simple chemical reactions and cleaved to reveal either a free reducing end of the oligosaccharide or a terminal amine with a C5&#8208;spacer. The phthalate structure in the second and third types of resin is sensitive to sodium methoxide and can also be cleaved during hydrazinolysis. Hydrazinolysis, rather than methanolysis, enables the isolation of oligosaccharide with pivaloyl ester protection and facilitates the purification process compared to partially protected compounds. Using these resins, we prepared nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide, including &#945; (1&#8208;6) mannan, &#945; (1&#8208;4) glucan, &#946; (1&#8208;4) glucan, and &#946; (1&#8208;3) glucan.</dc:description>

         <title>Method and Mechanistic Insights to 1,2&#8208;Aminochlorinate Alkenes using Blue&#8208;Light Activated Dichlorocarbamates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue light activation of N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates facilitates a direct 1,2&#8208;aminochlorination of unactivated olefins to yield 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;Cl compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates undergo a photochemical excitation to yield a neutral nitrogen&#8208;centered radical, which rapidly reacts with olefins in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion. Using this method, a range of functionally diverse substrates are successfully aminochlorinated to yield the corresponding 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;Cl compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Pachinko: Probing Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer of St. John&#8217;s Wort&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Photosensitizer Hypericin with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypericin from St. John&#8217;s wort has been used as a potent photosensitizer, but its working mechanism remains elusive which hinders its rational design for improved functionality. We implement ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum calculations to track the excited&#8208;state dynamics in an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of hypericin in solution. Using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), we track excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) via a previously unreported blueshift of a long&#8208;wavelength stimulated emission (SE) band with excitation&#8208;dependent dynamics in various solvents, owing to the dominant Q7,14 tautomer that undergoes bidirectional ESIPT. This finding is corroborated by ground&#8208;state femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (GS&#8208;FSRS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, contrasting the neutral and anionic forms of hypericin enables us to reveal an intramolecular charge transfer step underlying ESIPT. We demonstrate UV and visible excitations as an integral platform to provide direct insights into the photophysics and origin for phototoxicity of hypericin. Such mechanistic insights into the excited state of hypericin will power its future development and use.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8211;)&#8208;Myrioneurinol employing a "resolutive" late&#8208;stage Barton&#8208;McCombie Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so&#8208;called Barton&#8208;McCombie reaction is a transformation commonly used in organic synthesis for promoting deoxygenation of alcohols. Almost 50 years after its discovery, this reaction has become a powerful tool for organic chemists due to its wide range of applicability and functional group tolerance, which allows, with high level of anticipation, its incorporation into complex synthetic routes such as the ones aiming at the total synthesis of natural products. In this article, we describe the first example of a resolutive version of this reaction by using a chiral chlorothionate as the activating reagent, and its related strategic potential through a late&#8208;stage application in view of the total synthesis of both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid featuring 5 contiguous stereogenic centers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>By replacing a carbon atom of boranils with a nitrogen atom, azaboranils were newly designed. In the 2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils synthesized from 2&#8208;aminopyridines with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde, the pyridine ring underwent a hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the imine proton to restrain the molecular flexibility, which resulted in a significant improvement in luminescence quantum yield in both the solution state and the solid state over those for the parent boranils. The crystalline powder 4&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranil exhibited mechanochromism and vapochromism in the network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, halogen&#8208;bonding, H&#8208;F hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and CH&#8208;&#960; interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Structurally Complex Marine Cyclopropyl&#8208;Diterpenoids: Peyssonnoside A and Its Aglycon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peyssonnoside A is a marine&#8208;derived sulfated diterpenoid glucoside featuring a remarkable 5/6/3/6 tetracyclic skeleton with a highly substituted cyclopropane ring deeply embedded in its structure. Herein, we report on the full development of the first total synthesis of this natural product and its aglycon, peyssonnosol. Through the experimental evaluation of a series of synthetic strategies, including utilization of Ohloff&#8211;Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization and C&#8208;H allylation, we identified a concise, efficient, and highly diastereoselective route. Key steps in the synthesis of the aglycone peyssonnosol include a Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and a Mukaiyama hydration, both guided by the inherent spatial features of the substrates. This optimized approach enabled the synthesis of peyssonnosol in 12 steps and 21% overall yield and provides a robust framework for accessing structurally complex marine natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Upgrading Electron Transfer with High Conductivity MOF Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising energy storage devices, offering flexibility and smart functionalities to meet the growing demands of modern applications. However, challenges such as limited conductivity and stability continue to hinder their performance. Herein, a conductive composite was designed by forming one&#8208;dimension rod&#8208;like conductive MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on the hierarchical nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugated system between Ni2+ and HHTP establishes a robust electron delocalization network, significantly enhancing the conductivity and stability of the MOFs. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Ni&#8208;HHTP with Ni&#8208;OA effectively reduces internal electron transfer impedance, improving charge transport within the delocalized electronic networks. The synthesized Ni&#8208;OA@Ni&#8208;HHTP&#8208;6//AC achieves a remarkable energy density of 24.78 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 113.03 W kg&#8208;1, with a peak power density of 2924.58 W kg&#8208;1 at an energy density of 19.68 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of oxalate@conductive&#8208;MOF composites, paving the way for energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Generation of Sumanene&#8208;Based AIEgens for the Effective Recognition of Metal Cations in Solutions Containing 95 vol% of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the application of sumanene derivatives for the optical detection of metal cations was demonstrated. Unfortunately, known sumanene&#8208;based receptors enable the detection process in purely organic solutions or in aqueous media containing not lower than 50 vol% of organic solvent. Designing easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors able to effectively recognize metal cations in aqueous solutions containing a slight volume fraction of organic solvent remained an important and vital challenge. In this work, we show that water&#8208;insoluble sumanene receptors composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms enable the effective detection of cesium (Cs+) or lithium (Li+) cations in solutions containing 95 vol% of water. Their key feature is related to the exhibition of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. We discovered that the designed sumanene receptors exhibit excellent detection parameters expressed by Stern&#8208;Volmer constant values at the level from 108 to 1010 M&#8722;1. This work also shows that by simple modification of the sumanene receptor structure, it is possible to drastically change its detection preference from large Cs+ cations to small Li+ cations. The highest sensitivity of the designed receptors was concluded for Na+ or Li+, depending on the receptor structure. This work opens new avenues in designing sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cation of Tris(Triarylamine) Connected through 1,2,3&#8208;Benzenetriyl Bridge: A Three&#8208;Redox&#8208;Center Organic Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>

         <dc:description>
To explore intramolecular charge transfer pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) radical cation, in which three triarylamine redox&#8208;active&#8208;centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been prepared, and a combination of experimental (optical absorption and ESR spectroscopy) and theoretical analyses (density functional theory calculations) unveiled optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer processes for the radical cation as a nondegenerate multi&#8208;dimensional MV compound.







Abstract
To explore intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) (TTA), in which three triarylamine (TA) redox&#8208;active centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been newly synthesized. The MV state of the TTA radical cation has been investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, and the ICT pathway between three redox&#8208;active centers has been revealed. The intervalence CT (IVCT) band analysis gave an electronic coupling value comparable to the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(triarylamine) radical cation. Dynamic electron spin resonance studies clarified that the TTA radical cation was a nondegenerate MV system exhibiting ICT between the central TA and the peripheral TAs through the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridge.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Glycosyl Thiols and Trehalose&#8208;Type &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Thiodisaccharides by Cryo Thiol&#8208;Ene Photocoupling &#8211; Thio&#8208;Click Reaction in Frozen State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double photochemical cryo thiol&#8208;ene coupling process was developed as a general method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thio&#8208;linked di&#8208; and oligosaccharides. The procedure includes i) UV&#8208;initiated coupling reaction of 2&#8208;substituted glycals with HSAc in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C in frozen state, ii) selective S&#8208;deacetylation of the resulting glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SAc derivatives, iii) cryo thiol&#8208;ene reaction of the obtaining &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars with 2&#8208;substituted&#8208;glycals.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Glycosyl thiols are key building blocks for the formation of stable thioglycoside mimetics of widespread and biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides, which urges their efficient synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that the photoinitiated radical&#8208;mediated addition of thioacetic acid to 2&#8208;substituted glycals followed by selective S&#8208;deacetylation is a generally applicable and fully stereoselective method for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosyl thiols. The low reactivity of thioacetic acid in the radical reaction was overcome by carrying out the reaction in AcOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C, in frozen state, with UVA irradiation, achieving high yields irrespective of the sugar configurations. For effective irradiation and simultaneous effective cooling, a self&#8208;made spiral vessel reactor was used, which also enables large&#8208;scale synthesis. By subjecting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars to a second thiol&#8208;ene coupling reaction with 2&#8208;substituted glycals, 34 trehalose&#8208;type symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;thiodi&#8208; and oligosaccharides were obtained with full stereoselectivity. Moreover, the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars provided an easy access to &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diglycosyl disulfides.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving a hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif has been reported as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by modulating substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level, proposing a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.







Abstract
Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Toughened Polymer Networks: The Mighty Impact of Specially Designed Rings on Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;shaped compounds, such as 2D metallacycles and 3D cages, possess fixed geometric structures, adsorption capabilities, and reversible dynamic properties. When specially designed rings are incorporated as crosslinking points or integrated into the backbone structure, they can significantly improve the mechanical properties of polymer networks by releasing hidden lengths and undergoing conformational changes. This review summarizes recent research progress in regulating the mechanical properties of polymer networks through the introduction of ring structures.







Abstract
Polymer network materials are gaining significance in daily life and industrial applications. Improving polymer network materials&#8217; mechanical properties has long been a focus for chemists and materials scientists. Generally, rings in networks are viewed as adverse elements leading to reduced mechanical performance. In this conceptual article, recent advancements and related strategies in utilizing specially designed rings to enhance the mechanical properties of polymer networks are summarized and discussed. The article concludes by discussing current challenges and future prospects in this field. We aim for this article to offer readers an overview of ring&#8208;toughened polymer networks and to catalyze swift progress in this burgeoning area.

         <title>One Step Synthesis of 4,6,8&#8208;Trimethoxyazulenes &#8208; as Building Block for 2&#8208;Functionalized Azulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,6,8&#8208;Trimethoxyazulenes can now be generated from commercially available cheap starting materials. The methoxy substituents change the regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution at the azulene core to the 2&#8208;position which makes 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes good building blocks for 2&#8208;functionalized azulene compounds otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Here we present a simple gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of easily available diarylbutadiynes, with trimethoxybenzene as solvent and reactant to synthesize 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes. The methoxy substituents, which render the azulene very electron&#8208;rich, enable a change of azulenes typical regioselectivity for electrophilic substitutions, which enables facile electrophilic 2&#8208;substitution with iodine, bromine, chlorine, selenium or sulfur. Especially the 2&#8208;haloazulenes which can usually only be obtained through lengthy multistep syntheses are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted azulene derivatives.

         <title>Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Precise Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes the recent advances in the precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. The self&#8208;assembly behavior of BCPs can be modulated via either small&#8208;molecule or macromolecular approach to prepare uniform homogeneous and heterogeneous nanostructures in a highly controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This concept mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the concept is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.

         <title>Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of CO2, Esters and Epoxides with Pinacolborane: Selective Synthesis of Methanol in Multigram Scale</title>

We report a selective reduction of CO2 to methanol with HBpin in 99&#8201;% yield catalyzed by homoleptic cerium amide, establishing its potential as an excellent catalyst by preparing multigram&#8208;scale methanol. A practical application is also shown by reducing motorbike emitted CO2 to methanol. We also hydroborated challenging esters and reduced epoxides selectively.







Abstract
In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99&#8201;% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8722;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60&#8201;&#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Apoptosis of Cancer Cells Induced by a Kinase&#8208;Responsive Peptide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that responds to tyrosine kinase activity and induces selective apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing tyrosine kinase. The peptide self&#8208;assembled on the ER, reducing fluidity and triggering ER stress. This led to the activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9 ultimately activating caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7 for apoptosis. In vivo studies confirmed the antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential as an organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapy.







Abstract
Organelle targeting is a useful approach in drug development for cancer therapy. Peptide amphiphiles are good candidates for targeting specific organelles because they can be engineered into a wide range of molecular structures, enabling customization for specific functional needs. We have developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that can respond to tyrosine kinase activity and undergo phosphorylation inside cancer cells. C16&#8208;(EY)3 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells that overexpressed tyrosine kinase. The self&#8208;assembly of peptide amphiphiles on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane reduced the ER membrane fluidity and triggered ER stress. The mechanism of the cancer cell death induced by C16&#8208;(EY)3 was shown to involve phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, ER stress induction, and the subsequent activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9, which ultimately triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7. In vivo studies further validated the antitumor efficacy of C16&#8208;(EY)3, as transcutaneous administration of the peptide amphiphile inhibited tumor growth in mice. This study elucidated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the peptide amphiphile, indicating the potential of peptide amphiphiles as organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapeutics and providing a novel strategy for the development of selective and potent anticancer drugs.

         <title>Construction of Sub&#8208;Nano Channels of Amino Pillar[6]arene Inspired Biomimetic Porous Roots for Specific Remove of Imazamox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we successfully constructed PES membrane channels by layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly of amino pillar[6]arene. Moreover, the specific recognition of imazamox by amino pillar[6]arene made the membrane capable of specific extraction and removal of mazamox.







Abstract
The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub&#8208;nano channel membrane were constructed to remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad&#8208;leaved weeds. However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted. Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal. A layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly was formed through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde&#8208;amine Schiff&#8208;base reaction. The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host&#8208;guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8211;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we successfully constructed PES membrane channels by layer-upon-layer covalent assembly of amino pillar[6]arene. Moreover, the specific recognition of imazamox by amino pillar[6]arene made the membrane capable of specific extraction and removal of mazamox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub-nano channel membrane were constructed to remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds. However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted. Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal. A layer-upon-layer covalent assembly was formed through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde-amine Schiff-base reaction. The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host-guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8211;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals. The successful development of the highly selective porous root bionic membrane provides a broad prospect for its application and development in agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Lead&#8208;Free (Guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 Perovskite&#8208;Type Crystal toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with an Ultralow Detection Limit</title>

We have employed a zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth halogen perovskite to fabricate X&#8208;ray detector, demonstrating notable detection capabilities including high sensitivity and low detection limit.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free bismuth halogen perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their unique properties of bulk resistivity, significant X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and diminished ion migration. Herein, using the facile low&#8208;temperature solution method, we obtained a large&#8208;size single crystal of (guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 (GBB), which adopts a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) inorganic perovskite&#8208;like framework. The as&#8208;grown crystals show high resistivity (3.51&#215;1012&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm), low trap density (1.14&#215;1010&#8197;cm&#8722;3) and large carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;=1.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on GBB single crystals exhibit notable performances including low dark current drift, high sensitivity of ~1645.7&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and ultralow detection limit of ~0.85&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. This detection limit is among the lowest level for the reported 0D perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This study illuminates the prospective research into novel lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for the advancement of high&#8208;performance detectors of irradiation.

         <title>Activation of the Voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium Channel by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid glycans on amphiphilic glycopeptides influence cell membrane persistence and modulate Kv2.1 channel gating. Sulfation of HS enhances membrane association and potentiate VGIC activation, highlighting the critical role of glycan structure in VGIC activity.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8211;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and deactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. These results provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.

A series of PAM salts is rationally designed following supramolecular synthon approach that showed excellent gelation ability as well as self&#8208;healing, load&#8208;bearing and anti&#8208;cancer activities.







Abstract
Supramolecular synthon approach was employed to synthesize a series of primary ammonium monocarboxylate (PAM) salts derived from a well&#8208;known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen (NAP) and its amino acid conjugates namely naproxen&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (NAP&#8208;PHE) and naproxen&#8208;L&#8208;alanine (NAP&#8208;ALA), and four amines namely tyramine (TYRM), tryptamine (TRPM), 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenethylamine (DMP) and phenethylamine (PEA) as potential supramolecular gelators for developing self&#8208;drug delivery system. Out of the total twelve PAM salts thus synthesized, 75&#8201;% of the salts showed gelation ability. Importantly, majority of the gelator salts (67&#8201;%) displayed gelling abilities with topical gel formulating solvent methyl salicylate. One such salt, NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA was an ambidextrous gelator producing hydrogel with pure water and organogel with methyl salicylate with a minimum gelator concentration (MGC) of 0.5&#8197;wt % (w/v) thereby qualifying as a supergelator. The gels were extensively characterized by dynamic rheology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Supramolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; were probed by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in the hydrogelation process of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA. Single crystal structures of nine out of twelve salts were determined and the supramolecular synthon present therein was carefully analyzed. Intriguing insights of the gel&#8208;network structure was also investigated by structure&#8208;property correlation based on single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD, PXRD, respectively) analysis of gelator/nongelator salts. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer property against cancer cells (B16&#8208;F10, HeLa and A375); it was found non&#8208;cytotoxic against normal cell lines (E. derm and HEK&#8208;293) at comparable concentrations as revealed by MTT assays. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA also displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer behaviour against B16&#8208;F10 (scratch assay) and HeLa (multi&#8208;cellular tumour spheroid). The methyl salicylate gel of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8901;PEA displayed shape&#8208;sustaining, load&#8208;bearing, self&#8208;healing properties along with rheoreversibility, which are considered important for topical applications.

Synthesis of an amphiphile consist of hydrophobic camptothecin conjugated to an antisense DNA via GSH&#8208;responsive disulphide linker and its self&#8208;assembly into GSH&#8208;responsive NPs are reported. Simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic camptothecin and cell impermeable antisense DNA into the cancer cell in a GSH&#8208;responsive manner is shown. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1&#8208;CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione&#8208;responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self&#8208;assembly of DNA1&#8208;CPT results in the formation of GSH&#8208;responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self&#8208;assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.

         <title>Deciphering and Countering Formic Acid Permeability in Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a method for understanding formic acid crossover through Nafion&#8208;separated zero&#8208;gap cells, with and without an applied electric field. In&#8208;situ impedance measurements confirmed diffusion as the primary contributor to permeation. Using a design of experiments, we developed a cost&#8208;effective barrier layer reducing formic acid uptake by 46&#8201;%. These findings may enhance formic acid fuel cells and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications. Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2 electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8211;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid solution uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.

         <title>Exploring the Synthesis and Properties of Fluorinated Cationic Triangulenes and Their Precursors</title>

Partial defluorination of methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate led to synthesis of (3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) bis(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium, which was then used as a precursor to synthesize fluorinated acridiniums, dimethoxyquinacridinium and triangulenes. Fluorination induced red shifts in absorption and emission spectra and enhanced electrophilicity. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed altered packing patterns and formation of molecular dipoles as compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.







Abstract
Fluorination of tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium ((DMP)3C+) was achieved through the partial defluorination of the methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Using the fluorinated 2F((DMP)3C+) as a precursor, fluorinated tetramethoxy&#8208; and dimethoxyquin&#8208; acridinium salts (2F4 and 2F5 respectively) and trioxo&#8208;, azadioxo&#8208;, and diazaoxo&#8208; triangulenium salts (2F6, 2F7 and 2F8 respectively) were synthesized successfully in good to moderate yields. Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29&#8197;nm) and emission (13 to 41&#8197;nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials. X&#8208;ray structural analysis showed distinct packing patterns compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated analogues, indicating the presence of molecular dipoles.

         <title>Fluorescence of Aqueous Assemblies Regulated by Integral Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS contain interstitial water that separate NDI chromophores due to the steric hinderance of bulky POSS groups. This integral water is repelled for the assemblies of the analogues with flexible alkyl groups. The assemblies without integral water emit excimer fluorescence, while the integral water quenches the fluorescence POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS assemblies via non&#8208;radiative transition.







Abstract
Water is an integral and functional component for aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS molecules. Water serves not only as a solvent but also as an integral component (interstitial water) in aqueous colloids self&#8208;assembled from POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS (POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, NDI = naphthalene diimide). The interstitial water confined within these colloids is attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky POSS groups, which dissipates energy and quenches the fluorescence (FL). Control experiments with NDI molecules bearing less steric side groups (propyl or octyl), namely C3&#8722;NDI&#8208;C3 and C8&#8722;NDI&#8208;C8, confirm this role of water in structural assembly and optical function. This discovery opens new possibilities for the innovation of aqueous materials.

         <title>Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces novel fluorene&#8208;based hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), integrating iminodibenzyl and diphenylamine moieties. These materials exhibit remarkable photostability, optical, and thermal properties. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%. The findings highlight iminodibenzyl's potential to address stability and cost challenges, paving the way for next&#8208;generation HTMs in PSCs.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26&#8201;% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon&#8208;based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron&#8208;donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene&#8208;based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (TMF&#8208;2 and TDF&#8208;2) and diphenylamine (TMF&#8208;1 and TDF&#8208;1) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20&#8201;%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.

     alt="Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces novel fluorene-based hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), integrating iminodibenzyl and diphenylamine moieties. These materials exhibit remarkable photostability, optical, and thermal properties. Among them, TDF-2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%. The findings highlight iminodibenzyl's potential to address stability and cost challenges, paving the way for next-generation HTMs in PSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26&#8201;% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon-based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron-donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene-based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (&lt;b&gt;TMF-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TDF-2&lt;/b&gt;) and diphenylamine (&lt;b&gt;TMF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TDF-1&lt;/b&gt;) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, &lt;b&gt;TDF-2&lt;/b&gt; achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20&#8201;%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we report the nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts (2) follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrating remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) up to 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas nickel electrocatalysts (1; having N&#8208;donor ligands with selenoether ligands) follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show a kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Unraveling the electronic structure of metal complexes can bring various catalytic possibilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the electronic effect of metal and ligands modulating and switching the reaction center for HER has yet to be comprehensively analyzed. Herein, we report nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in less deprotonating DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrated remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) upto 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas Ni&#8208;electrocatalyst having N&#8208;donor and selenoether ligands follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%. A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study using CD3CO2D provides kH/kD=0.49 and 13.01 values for two types of catalysts suggestive of metal&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered catalytic behavior, respectively. Also, EPR studies revealed nickel&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered radicals in two types of Ni&#8208;electrocatalysts. Mechanistically, the EPR, CV, and DFT computation studies suggest that the electron density of the selenoether ligand plays a crucial role by acting as an electron reservoir in deciding the reaction pathways, whether hydride formation occurs at metal&#8208;centered leading to Ni&#8722;H intermediate or ligand&#8208;centered pathways for HER.

         <title>The Missing Link in the Monogermanide Series: YbGe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synthesis of YbGe under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions, the series of binary rare&#8208;earth monogermanides is completed. The compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure, such as the representatives La&#8722;Pr, and Lu. Despite the absence of &#8220;excess&#8221; electrons, 4&#8208;atomic Yb4 basins were found, with an increasing formation tendency as Yb&#8810;Lu&lt;La.







Abstract
High&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis at 12&#8197;GPa between 750 and 1000&#8201;&#176;C for 30 to 300&#8197;min yields the last missing rare&#8208;earth metal monogermanide, YbGe. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal that the compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure (space group Pnma, a=7.901(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.8981(9)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.873(2)&#8197;&#197;). The results of the chemical bonding study, while supporting the presence of polyanionic Ge chains interacting with the surrounding Yb through multi&#8208;atomic polar bonds, suggest a transitional scenario between the monogermanides formed by alkaline&#8208;earth elements and those formed by trivalent rare&#8208;earth metals.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe Differentiates Apoptosis from Cysteine&#8208;Deprivation Ferroptosis through Imaging of Viscosity and Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecule that can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during different cellular stress. However, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs), thus demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.







Abstract
Since death is an inevitable phenomenon, exploring cell deaths holds importance. During this process, the cellular microenvironment within cells such as pH, polarity, viscosity etc alter. One such microenvironment, viscosity elevates during different cell deaths. However, demarcating cell death processes solely based on viscosity sensing is challenging. Herein, we develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP after careful investigation among three analogues for efficient viscosity imaging in HeLa cells. Cationic PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecular probe, can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during apoptosis, starvation and drug induced ferroptosis processes. Notably, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs) instead of mitochondria. Thus, the probe has a potential for demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.

         <title>Switching Photoluminescence Wavelength of Arylated Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes by Utilizing Steric Hindrance in Reductive Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of substituent in the aryl groups at an appropriate position is effective to control near infrared photoluminescence efficiency and wavelength of arylated single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. Theoretical calculations of the corresponding model compounds revealed that these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.







Abstract
(6,5)&#8208;enriched single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were reductively arylated using sodium naphthalenide and monosubstituted and disubstituted iodobenzene derivatives to control their photoluminescence (PL) properties. In the reactions with substituted iodobenzenes, the degree of functionalization was influenced by the substituents on the aryl groups depending on their position, which allowed us to realize control of the PL intensity and wavelength. The methyl or methoxy group at the 2&#8208;position and methyl groups at the 3,5&#8208;positions of the phenyl group respectively increased the E11** PL and E11* PL selectivity at ~1230 and ~1100&#8197;nm. Methyl groups at the 2,6&#8208;positions emerged two new PL peaks. These PL characteristics were prominently observed in the (6,4) SWCNT adducts, which were separated by gel chromatography. Theoretical calculations of model compounds showed that the effect of the substituent at the ortho&#8208;position on the relative stability of the isomers with different binding configurations was greater for the diarylated SWCNTs than for the hydroarylated SWCNTs. Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the choice of substituents on the benzene ring was effectively used to modulate the PL wavelength, and these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.

Theoretical calculations of the corresponding model compounds revealed that these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6,5)-enriched single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were reductively arylated using sodium naphthalenide and monosubstituted and disubstituted iodobenzene derivatives to control their photoluminescence (PL) properties. In the reactions with substituted iodobenzenes, the degree of functionalization was influenced by the substituents on the aryl groups depending on their position, which allowed us to realize control of the PL intensity and wavelength. The methyl or methoxy group at the 2-position and methyl groups at the 3,5-positions of the phenyl group respectively increased the E&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;** PL and E&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;* PL selectivity at ~1230 and ~1100&#8197;nm. Methyl groups at the 2,6-positions emerged two new PL peaks. These PL characteristics were prominently observed in the (6,4) SWCNT adducts, which were separated by gel chromatography. Theoretical calculations of model compounds showed that the effect of the substituent at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-position on the relative stability of the isomers with different binding configurations was greater for the diarylated SWCNTs than for the hydroarylated SWCNTs. Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the choice of substituents on the benzene ring was effectively used to modulate the PL wavelength, and these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Non&#8208;Heme &#956;&#8208;Oxodicobalt(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>

The reaction of a CoIII complex of an N2O2 set of donor ligand assists the formation of an &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) species, which was found stable at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The intermediate species works as an oxidant for the C&#8722;H atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A mononuclear CoIII complex (1) of a bisamide&#8208;bisalkoxide donor ligand was synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The reaction of 1 with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) in acetonitrile at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of a &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) complex (2), which was characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy which revealed a short Co&#8722;Ooxo distance of 1.67&#8197;&#197;. Reactivity studies of 2 towards oxidation/oxygenation of hydrocarbon C&#8722;H bond and triphenylphosphine or thioanisole derivatives have been examined. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy studies showed the appearance of clear isosbestic points during the oxidation of substrates together with a neat transformation of 2 to 1. Detailed kinetic investigations established that 2 follows a Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer (CPET) mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation and has a weak electrophilic character. Catalytic behavior of 1 was noted towards the oxygen atom transfer reactions. This study showcases the spectroscopic investigation and reactivity studies of a CoIV(&#956;&#8208;O)CoIV moiety. Although the FeIV analog of such a core has been described before, the study describes the first example with a CoIV center.

Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 releases H2 to form two isomers of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2, which are selectively trapped with the tetrylenes Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 and Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2, there being a direct relationship between the size of the ligand donor atom (Ge vs Sn) and the trapped isomer. Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 generates OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 gives OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.







Abstract
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) releases H2 to form the isomeric tetrahydrides 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2. Tetrylenes E{N(SiMe3)2}2 (E=Ge, Sn) are able to selectively trap these isomers distinguishing between them. Tetrylene Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 catches 2&#8201;b to generate OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (3), which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 captures 2&#8201;a to give OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (4) with the donor atoms defining a pentagonal bipyramid around the osmium center.

Theoretical study of small methylaluminoxane sheets (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m indicates that DFT electronically stabilizes those featuring 5&#8208;coordinate Al and 4&#8208;coordinate O compared with higher level MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations which favor 4&#8208;coordinate Al. The anions formed from these precursors all feature 4&#8208;coordinate Al and their relative stabilities explain the appearance of ESI&#8208;MS spectra recorded during the hydrolysis of Me3Al.







Abstract
The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n=1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n=5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n=1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et&#8197;al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Ixabepilone and Its Analogues Enabled by Highly Efficient Asymmetric Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>

Herein, we developed a highly efficient and convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence by the assembly of three key synthons which are synthezied through practical asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
The convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence is reported. The crucial chiral centers at challenging C3&#8208;O, C8&#8208;C and C15&#8208;N positions on the scaffold of the ixabepilone were installed via highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenations (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% e.e.) and all three fragments could be prepared on gram scale. The key aldol reaction bridges the aldehyde and keto fragments with high yield and exquisite diastereo control (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r.). Finally, a novel RCM reaction conformationally controlled by a bulky silyl group was reported, which allows the facile synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues.

         <title>Me2Se and Me2Te: Their Structures and Synergistic Effects of Halogen/Chalcogen Bonding with C6F5Br and C6F5I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
150&#8201;and 125&#8201;years after their first mention, the solid state structures of dimethyl selenide and telluride are reported. They are dominated by chalcogen bonding. Their combination with C6F5Br and C6F5I as halogen bond donors leads to different types of aggregates and extraordinarily short I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te bonding interactions. The analysis of occurrence, strength and directionality of intermolecular forces helps to understand the rules behind cocrystals formation.







Abstract
This work combines halogen and chalcogen bonding. Short, polarity directed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch (X=Br or I, Ch=Se or Te) contacts were prepared by in&#8197;situ low&#8208;temperature cocrystallization of liquid mixtures of neutral pentafluorohalogenobenzenes C6F5X and dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Ch. Solid&#8208;state structures of Me2Se and Me2Te were determined 150 and 125&#8197;years after their first description. Significant C&#8722;Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts make Me2Se dimeric and Me2Te polymeric. The cocrystals comprise C6F5X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XC6F5 aggregates, except the combination X/Ch=I/Te which shows polymeric C6F5I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeMe2&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 aggregation. The observed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions are the shortest of this type, and the C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are shorter than the corresponding C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions. Heteromolecular C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are accompanied by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/F and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in the cocrystals. The analysis of packing and contacts in all (co)crystals was complemented by computational studies. They both show that short interactions can be designed and engineered with reasonable predictability.

         <title>A Unique Case of &#8242;in Situ&#8217; Bifluoride Triggered Formation of Supramolecular Organogels Using Isophthalamide Hydrogen Bond Donating Receptors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units deprotonates in the presence of TBAF and the deprotonated L22&#8722; binds the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722;. Combination of the H&#8208;bond donor abilities of the isophthalamide motif and the presence of the carboxylic acid moieties promotes a complex and unexpected isodesmic self&#8208;assembly process uniquely with HF2&#8722; leading to the formation of a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel.







Abstract
A novel isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units has been synthesised and its anion binding properties analysed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in DMSO&#8208;d6/0.5&#8201;% H2O. As expected, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) fluoride the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moieties was observed. However, the deprotonated receptor L22&#8722; was able to bind the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722; via the formation of H&#8208;bonds with the amide NHs. When H2L2 was dissolved in THF and 4 equivalents of TBAF were added in CH3CN a unique sol&#8208;gel transition occurred giving rise to a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel. Theoretical calculations elucidated the gelation mechanism and strongly support the findings observed experimentally.

The hemilabile character of the NSi ligand in 18e saturated Rh&#8211;(&#954;2&#8208;NSi) species has been demonstrated.







Abstract
The 18e saturated rhodium(III) species [Rh(H)(X)(&#954;2&#8208;NSitBu2)(bipyMe2)] (NSitBu2={4&#8208;methylpyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy}ditertbutylsilyl; bipyMe2=4,4'&#8208;dimethylbipyridine) (X=Cl, 1; OTf, 2) have been prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in the case of 2 it has been possible to determine its solid&#8208;state structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Complex 1 has proven to be an effective catalyst precursor for the reaction of styrene derivatives with hydrosilanes in CD2Cl2. However, under catalytic conditions complex 2 decomposes. The performance of the 1&#8208;catalyzed reaction of styrene with hydrosilanes strongly depends on the nature of the silane, the best catalytic performance was achieved using HSiMe2Ph. Theoretical and 1H NMR studies indicate that the hemilabile nature of the NSi ligand is key to understanding the catalytic activity of compound 1.

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of perylene described as a doubly linked azulene dimer has been successfully synthesized. This compound exhibits not only the reversible redox behaviors and p&#8208;type semiconductivity but also one of the narrowest values of the optical band gap among the hitherto reported non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720&#8197;nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72&#8197;eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.

         <title>Characterization of the Titanium(III) Tris(alkyl) Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 and its Conversion to a Dimeric Alkyl&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trigonal pyramidal titanium(III) trialkyl is synthesized in moderate, reproducible yield via the reaction of three equivalents of Li{CH(SiMe3)2} with TiCl3(NMe3)2 in hexanes. The use of the latter solvent is a key feature for the success of the synthetic route. Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR and electronic spectroscopy.







Abstract
The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32&#8201;% yield. Single crystal X&#8208;Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8722;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy gives spectral parameters consistent with the proposed Ti(III) formulation. Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8722;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;&#8208;CHSiMe2CHSiMe3}]2 (2).

         <title>Molecular Structural Control of the Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Balance in Solids: Structure&#8208;Phase Correlation in DADQs with Enhanced/Switchable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental correlation of the molecular/supramolecular structural factors that promote amorphous, crystalline and bi&#8208;stable states in molecular solids is derived through spectroscopic investigations, crystallographic analysis and thermal studies of a family of molecular solids based on alkoxyalkyl substituted diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes exhibiting strong and switchable fluorescence. The correlation is used to predict and demonstrate a new functional molecular phase change material.







Abstract
The amorphous/crystalline (A/C) assembly in molecular solids has a direct bearing on their attributes and applications, including mechanical, pharmaceutical, electronic and photophysical. A systematic analysis of the molecular features and interactions that determine the predilection towards the A, C or bi&#8208;stable A&#8208;C states is critical. This fundamental problem is addressed through an exhaustive investigation of a large family of alkoxyalkyl diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (ROR&#8242;&#8208;DADQs); enhancement of their fluorescence from the solution, to the A, to the C state serves as an excellent signature of the phase preference and temporal stability. Their thermal characteristics and single crystal structure investigations coupled with Hirshfeld surface analysis of the intermolecular interactions, not only confirm the spectroscopic observations, but also reveal the significant impact of the molecular structural features, key interactions like H&#8208;bonds, and molecular orientations in the lattice, on the phase stability. These explorations lead to a basic structure&#8208;phase correlation; its predictive power is demonstrated by identifying the borderline systems as functional phase change materials, and the subsequent verification through the reversible cycles of fluorescence switching between the A/C states. The factors promoting the A or C forms of molecular solids can guide the design of novel materials exploiting such supramolecular structures and their interconversions.

         <title>Carbamate&#8208;Functionalized NLOphores via a Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces carbamate donor groups for activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, enabling tunable chromophores with &#955;max values of 363&#8211;692&#8197;nm. Positive solvatochromism, protonation experiments, and TD&#8208;DFT studies support the charge transfer characteristics of the chromophores. NLO properties were investigated via the EFISHG technique, with &#956;&#946; values ranging from 470&#215;10&#8722;48 to 5400&#215;10&#8722;48 esu.







Abstract
This study introduces a new donor group capable of activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, generally known for their limited scope. Target chromophores were synthesized using isocyanate&#8208;free urethane synthesis. The developed synthetic method allows for the tuning of the optical properties of the chromophores by modifying the donor groups, the acceptor units, and the side chains. The charge transfer (CT) bands of the chromophores exhibit &#955;max values ranging from 363 to 692&#8197;nm. The CT bands observed have been supported by solvatochromism and protonation experiments. The synthesized compounds exhibit positive solvatochromism. Due to their potential as NLOphore candidates, the stability of the synthesized compounds have been investigated both experimentally through TGA and theoretically by calculating parameters such as frontier orbital energy differences, electronegativity, and global hardness/softness. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to elucidate the nature of the electronic transitions, revealing that the bands correspond to CT arising from HOMO&#8208;to&#8208;LUMO excitations. The NLO properties of the chromophores were investigated theoretically by DFT methods and experimentally by the EFISHG technique. Both results are shown to be in agreement with HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy differences. The experimental &#956;&#946; values of the selected molecules range from 470&#215;10&#8722;48 to 5400&#215;10&#8722;48 esu.

Color tuneable luminescent molecular salts as promising AIE&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Mechanochromic materials, known for their ability to change color in response to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, stretching, grinding, or rubbing, hold significant importance due to their diverse applications. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel pyridine&#8208;tethered imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine mechanoresponsive luminogens with appended tetraphenylethene, named GBY&#8208;10 and GBY&#8208;11. GBY&#8208;10 exhibited reversible mechanofluorochromism, while GBY&#8208;11 did not revert to its original color after solvent fuming. The photophysical properties of these luminogens were significantly influenced by the position of the terminal pyridine. Additionally, we created color&#8208;tunable mechanoresponsive molecular salts by co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with various aryl acid derivatives. Co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with pentafluorobenzoic acid resulted in a significant bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by 66&#8197;nm, compared to 37&#8197;nm and 12&#8197;nm shift for benzoic acid and para&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. This counter&#8208;ion&#8208;dependent luminescence suggests strong electronic interactions between the counter ions. These luminogens also demonstrated reversible pH&#8208;responsive behaviour, making them suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Furthermore, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized luminogen, GBY&#8208;10, showed metal ion detection (Mn2+, Ag+, Fe3+) ability in water, with detection limits as low as 0.0043, 0.015, and 0.0029&#8197;mM, respectively. This report opens new avenues for designing promising AIE&#8208;active materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, optoelectronics, and biomedicine. A de&#8208;novo approach of engineering imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold to mechanoresponsive AIE&#8208;active molecules for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and metal sensing applications. By co&#8208;grinding the designed luminogens with various aryl acid derivatives, color tuneable mechanoresponsive molecular salts can be further developed.

         <title>In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Investigation of Isotope&#8208;Selective Breathing in MIL&#8208;53 During Dihydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ continuous wave EPR approach utilising Cr3+ and V4+ ions in the framework of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) is successfully conducted to monitor the dihydrogen isotopologue&#8208;selective breathing transition on the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) framework. In addition, the temperature&#8208;dependent 3p ESEEM experiment can be implemented to sense the D2 from the perspective of the V4+ spin probe in the MIL&#8208;53 (Al).







Abstract
The development of smart materials capable of separating dihydrogen isotopologues has risen recently. Among potential candidates, the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) has been gaining attention due to its structural flexibility providing the so&#8208;called &#8216;&#8217;breathing mechanism&#8217;&#8217; that can be useful to separate hydrogen isotopologues selectively. In the present work, an in&#8197;situ continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance investigation has been proven as a sensitive technique to follow the isotopologue&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;desorption of dihydrogen species on the paramagnetic metal&#8208;doped MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99Cr0.01) and MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01), respectively. The presence of paramagnetic spin probes such as Cr3+ and V4+ inside the MIL&#8208;53 framework allows for monitoring the framework transition including the 2nd transition step that selectively occurs at p&gt;100&#8197;mbar when D2 gas is adsorbed on the pores at 23&#8197;K. Furthermore, investigation of D2 desorption from MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01) by temperature&#8208;dependent hyperfine spectroscopy provides a more detailed analysis of the D2 desorption process on a microscopic scale with respect to the embedded spin probe.

         <title>Two Consecutive Pathways Competing for Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>

Depending on preparation methods, NDI molecules can assemble into J&#8208;type or H&#8208;type fibers along two pathways in organic solutions. Intermediate aggregates are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques along both pathways and further verified by thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting, suggesting two consecutive assembling pathways from identical initial conditions.







Abstract
The final outcomes of supramolecular assembly are determined by the pathways and the formation of intermediates during the assembly process. We studied pathway complexity involving two consecutive pathways in supramolecular polymerization of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) derivative molecule. Depending on preparation methods anisotropic aggregates of J&#8208;type nanorods (Agg&#8197;I) or more flexible H&#8208;type nanofibers (Agg&#8197;II) are obtained from the identical initial state in solution of methyl cyclohexane (MCH) or MCH/CHCl3 mixtures. More interestingly intermediate aggregates driven by intra&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques for both pathways. Thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting suggests that both pathways are consecutive ones with intermediate aggregates. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, we propose the molecular packing of Agg&#8197;I and II. Our results reveal comprehensive pathway complexity in self&#8208;assembly of molecules as simple as NDI.

         <title>Creating Dual Active Sites in Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>

Three metals and two reactions: Trace&#8208;ruthenium&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional manganese&#8208;based MOFs have been demonstrated as highly active and stable bifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method.







Abstract
The design of well&#8208;engineered bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving durable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. In this study, Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 itself has Ru sites and generates FeMnOOH under catalytic conditions, forming dual active sites for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ru dopants exhibit optimized binding strength for H* and enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the Mn sites within FeMnOOH lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*), serving as the active centre for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The incorporation of Ru significantly improves the electron transfer properties of FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and enhances its water adsorption capacity, synergistically boosting its bifunctional activity. This strategy of designing dual active sites provides new insights into the development of bifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient overall water splitting.

         <title>Front Cover: Porous Organic Polymers for CO2 Capture and Catalytic Conversion (Chem. Eur. J. 13/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers have garnered significant attention in carbon dioxide capture and catalytic conversion applications due to their high specific surface area, stable chemical properties, and ease of functionalization. The type of adsorption plays a crucial role in determining the adsorption efficiency and catalytic performance of these materials in CO&#8322; capture and conversion. The Review by Z. Zhong, X. Wang and B. Tan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404089) offers a brief comparison of the effects of different adsorption types on adsorption efficiency, as well as their influence on both chemo&#8208; and photocatalytic conversions. Additionally, a perspective on the future development of this field is provided.

         <title>Tuning Optical Properties of Organic Thin Films through Intermolecular Interactions &#8211; Fundamentals, Advances and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>

Aggregation of dyes can significantly alter their electronic and optical properties through various physical mechanisms. In this review, we review their fundamentals, their relevance in research and practical applications, and the extent of property changes observed upon aggregation so far.







Abstract
In applications ranging from photon&#8208;energy conversion into electrical or chemical forms (such as photovoltaics or photocatalysis) to numerous sensor technologies based on organic solids, the role of supramolecular structures and chromophore interactions is crucial. This review comprehensively examines the critical intermolecular interactions between organic dyes and their impact on optical properties. We explore the range of changes in absorption or emission properties observed in molecular aggregates compared to single molecules. Each effect is dissected to reveal its physicochemical foundations, relevance to different application domains, and documented examples from the literature that illustrate the potential modulation of absorption or emission properties by molecular and supramolecular structural adjustments. This work aims to serve as a concise guide for exploiting supramolecular phenomena in the innovation of novel optical and optoelectronic organic materials, with emphasis on strategic application and exploitation.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for CO2 Capture and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 13, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the preparation of four types of porous organic polymers is briefly summarized, followed by a discussion of the effects of physical and chemical adsorption on carbon dioxide capture by porous materials. Finally, the effects of the type of adsorption on the chemical and photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide are discussed, and the prospects of chemical adsorption for carbon dioxide capture and conversion at low concentrations are presented.







Abstract
Overuse of fossil fuels and anthropogenic activities have led to excessive emissions of carbon dioxide, leading to global warming, and measures to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are needed to overcome this global challenge. Therefore, exploring an environmentally friendly strategy for capturing airborne CO2 and converting it into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising pathway toward &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. In recent years, porous organic polymers have attracted much attention for carbon capture and the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide because of their high specific surface area, high chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural versatility, which make them easy to functionalize. In this review, we introduce the preparation methods for various POPs, the types of POPs adsorbed during carbon dioxide capture, and the progress in the use of POPs for the photocatalytic and chemicatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, with a special discussion on the influence of adsorption type on the efficiency of catalytic conversion. Finally, we propose a prospective direction for the subsequent development of this field.

Finally, the effects of the type of adsorption on the chemical and photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide are discussed, and the prospects of chemical adsorption for carbon dioxide capture and conversion at low concentrations are presented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overuse of fossil fuels and anthropogenic activities have led to excessive emissions of carbon dioxide, leading to global warming, and measures to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are needed to overcome this global challenge. Therefore, exploring an environmentally friendly strategy for capturing airborne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converting it into high-value-added chemicals offers a promising pathway toward &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. In recent years, porous organic polymers have attracted much attention for carbon capture and the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide because of their high specific surface area, high chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural versatility, which make them easy to functionalize. In this review, we introduce the preparation methods for various POPs, the types of POPs adsorbed during carbon dioxide capture, and the progress in the use of POPs for the photocatalytic and chemicatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, with a special discussion on the influence of adsorption type on the efficiency of catalytic conversion. Finally, we propose a prospective direction for the subsequent development of this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Oxoiron(IV) Complex Supported by an N&#8208;alkylated Cyclam Ligand System Containing a Pendant Alcohol Moiety.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of a pendant neutral alcohol moiety in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) ligand backbone is examined for the non&#8208;heme mononuclear oxoiron(IV) unit in [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC&#8208;HOR)(NCCH3)]2+ (1&#8208;syn) (TMC&#8208;HOR = 2&#8208;(4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecan1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol). Unlike in the related [FeIV(Oanti)(TMC&#8208;SR)]+ (3&#8208;anti) (TMC&#8208;SR = 1&#8208;mercaptoethyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex, bearing an axial mono&#8208;anionic thiolate ligand trans to the oxo unit, the alcohol moiety in 1&#8208;syn stays protonated and does not axially coordinate to iron. The protonation of the alcohol moiety is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the oxoiron(IV) core; it presumably serves as a hydrogen bonding donor to the oxoiron(IV) unit, which is positioned syn to the three methyl groups. Comparative reactivity studies reveal 1&#8208;syn to be a stronger hydrogen atom abstraction but weaker oxygen atom transfer agent relative to the [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC)(NCCH3)]2+ (2&#8208;syn) complex, bearing the N&#8208;tetramethylated cyclam (TMC) ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Malonate&#8208;Based Iodonium Ylides to Generate Dihydrofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While iodonium ylides are important reantants in a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Diborane(4) Reactivity: Lewis Acid to Bind Lewis&#8208;Basic Substrates and Electron Donor For Substrate Reduction Through Stimulated Diborane&#8208;Substrate Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208; and dibromido&#8208;diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8208;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono&#8208; and dicationic pyrazine&#8208;diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fluoride Ion Affinity Revisited: Do We Need the Anchor&#8208;Point Approach?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large and diverse high&#8208;level benchmark data set of computed gas&#8208;phase fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) for 71 small main&#8208;group Lewis acids is presented. It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor&#8208;point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self&#8208;interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor&#8208;point approach based on OCF2 has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor&#8208;point calculations based on Me3Si+ even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break&#8208;down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor&#8208;point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, direct computations of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions are the clearly preferable route.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanosecond Hyperquenching, a Novel Method of Specimen Preparation for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major challenge in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) is preparing the protein specimen without the artifacts caused by the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Here, we introduce nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) &#8211; a novel method of artifact&#8208;free specimen preparation. The fast narrow jet impinges liquid cryogen at 77 K and breaks up, forming 30 &#8211; 150&#8208;nm&#8208;thick vitrified films. NHQ films with protein particles are formed directly in the liquid cryogen, which precludes AWI tension&#8208;driven protein adsorption, preferred orientation, subunit dissociation and denaturation. The formed film surfaces are essentially specimen&#8208;free, with a 2.7&#8208;nm&#8208;thick protein depleted layer of hyperquenched glassy water (HGW). This &#8220;surface sealing&#8221; appears to be the first essential stage of vitrification at NHQ conditions; it occurs in about 35 ps on cryogen encounter. We outline the depletion mechanism, where the growing HGW layer displaces protein particles from the surface inwards the film.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent interactions of surface adsorbed species control the self&#8208;assembly of calcinated nickel oxide nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two&#8208;dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in&#8208;depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non&#8208;polar faceted. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the surface&#8208;adsorbed non&#8208;dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling. Interactions between water molecules adsorbed on two vicinal NiO NPs are responsible for keeping the self&#8208;assembly of the Ni(OH)2 NPs upon heat treatment. In carbamide&#8208;based NiO NPs, the self&#8208;assembly of initially formed Ni3(OH)4(NO3)2 NPs is not preserved. These NPs are terminated with polar (111) atomic planes, on which water molecules dissociatively adsorb, giving surface hydroxyl groups. As the hydrogen bonding proton &#8211; donating and accepting abilities are negligible at OH&#8208;polar terminated NiO NPs, only unfavorable inter&#8208;NP interactions are possible which leads to disruption of the NP assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Catalysis Using Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process in C&#8722;H bond functionalisation catalysis, allowing the formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The progress made in this field is addressed, highlighting the role played by specific metals in its development, and recaps the state of the art in the application of OIRE chemistry in transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process to enable the effective formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically triggered oxidation of appropriate metal complexes leading to a reductive elimination process otherwise chemically unfavorable has long been studied in stoichiometric metal&#8208;centered reactions. However, its conscious inclusion and targeted application in catalysis is a rather recent development. Ruthenium and Group 9 metal complexes are particularly representative examples of how the observed OIRE abilities can be modulated using different coupling partners. Parallels can be drawn between rhodium and iridium, which have a long history as efficient catalysts, and their more readily available 3d row metal neighbor, i.&#8201;e. cobalt, with ruthenium also providing a matching reactivity. This review explores the history of OIRE reactions throughout the last few centuries, highlighting the role of Ti, Mo, Fe, Hg, Ni, Ru and group 9 transition metals as key players in C&#8722;H bond functionalization and OIRE chemistry, discussing the most relevant studies published in the field whilst pinpointing research gaps that require new theoretical and mechanistic studies, with the final goal of unlocking the full potential of OIRE chemistry in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis and Structural Reidentification of Alstrostines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of alstrostines was accomplished in 18 or 19 steps using our proposed bioinspired strategy. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea&#8197;luxurians was reidentified and named epialstrostine A.







Abstract
Alstrostine A and isoalstrostine A are monoterpenoid indole alkaloid glycosides with unique structures found in the plant families Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae. With molecular weights exceeding 900, nine chiral centers (excluding sugar rings), and complex fused&#8208;ring structures, the structural elucidation of these molecules using spectral analysis is highly challenging. Therefore, their structural identification through total synthesis is important in both natural product chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, we successfully accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of these alkaloids in 18 or 19 steps. A key synthetic feature was a two&#8208; or three&#8208;component coupling reaction between secologanin and a pyrrolidinoindoline moiety based on our proposed biosynthetic pathway. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea luxurians (Rubiaceae) was successfully reidentified and renamed as epialstrostine A.

         <title>Quinones as Multifunctional Scaffolds for Oxidative, Reductive, and HAT Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinone scaffolds facilitate light&#8208;driven redox transformations across a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V, supporting oxidative, reductive, and HAT reactions. Oxidative and HAT processes occur under ambient air, while reductive transformations require an inorganic base. Their adaptability to facilitate a broad range of radical and ionic processes under just two conditions highlights the potential of quinone scaffolds in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis, which enables both electron and hydrogen atom transfer, has become a powerful tool for activating chemical bonds and synthesizing complex molecules under mild conditions. Typically, photocatalysts are optimized either for oxidative or reductive reactions within a limited redox window (less than 3.1&#8197;V) and for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions, with few frameworks capable of mediating both pathways for high redox&#8208;demanding reactions (covering more than a 5&#8197;V redox window) without requiring special conditions. Herein, we report the use of quinones as multifunctional scaffolds in light&#8208;driven redox transformations, offering access to a redox window of approximately 5&#8197;V using visible light. The quinone scaffold's versatility facilitates a wide range of radical and ionic processes under both oxidative and reductive conditions, in addition to enabling HAT reactions. By keeping the parameters, i.&#8201;e. the reaction partners, constant, such transformations can be carried out under just two reaction conditions. Oxidative transformations and HAT reactions occur under ambient air, while activation of the chromophore for reductive transformations can be achieved using an inorganic base (Cs2CO3) via a simple acid&#8208;base deprotonation event. This dual capability highlights the potential of quinones as scaffolds to extend their utility in photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics and Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group Effects in Two&#8208;Photon Switchable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;linear optical reactive systems have important applications which require highly localized effects. Recently, we reported for the first time that donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have important two&#8208;photon switching properties.&#160;Here, we report on the nature of the non&#8208;linear excitation event and the resulting&#160;dynamics through femtosecond&#8208;resolved measurements. From these experiments we directly show the central role of specific higher singlet states in the initial two&#8208;photon transition step. To test the generality of the involvement of such higher states, we synthesized new two&#8208;photon switchable DASAs with varying electron accepting groups. Specifically, we&#160;detected a rapid decaying emission from the initially formed higher singlets (Sn, n&gt;1) which is followed by the indirect formation of the S1&#160;state from Sn&#8594;S1&#160;internal conversion which in turn leads to the switching reaction. Importantly, the new DASAs show up to a factor of three larger two&#8208;photon cross sections in comparison with&#160;our previously reported molecules. Computational results&#160;are consistent with the central role of specific higher singlets in the non&#8208;linear switching of DASAs at&#160;approximately 3 eV above the electronic ground state. The present results identify the key variables with respect to the non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;switching reactions of these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Binary Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to rapidly produce large single crystals is crucial for advancing the applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Although the modulation strategy provides a straightforward method for growing high&#8208;quality single crystals, the slow crystallization process of COFs often limits their practical use. In this study, we combined the principles of crystallization thermodynamics and kinetics with the modulation strategy to develop a binary solvent&#8208;supersaturation method, enabling the growth of single&#8208;crystal COFs in a significantly shorter time. By systematically investigating the crystal&#8208;growth kinetics across different solvent ratios, we established a diffusion&#8208;reaction growth model, highlighting the essential role of supersaturation in controlling COF crystal growth. Especially, under this crystallization guidance, elegant single crystals of COFs built with heteroatom or other functionality can also facilely obtained, which spontaneously validate the universality of the protocol. Importantly, the resulting single&#8208;crystal COFs, characterized by high structural symmetry, exhibited notable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity, which could open new avenues for future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8209;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxindole&#8208;Bearing Pyrroloindoline via Gold Catalyzed Carbophilic Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new type of gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization reaction between diazo oxindole and tryptamine has been developed by utilizing the combination of L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3 = hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst. This method allows for the facile preparation of a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving a cascade process of regioselective nucleophilic addition of the carbophilic gold carbenoid intermediate onto tryptamine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization, has been proposed, in which, the high diastereoselectivity is attributed to a preferred transition state. Moreover, three oxindole&#8208;bearing indolo[2,3&#8208;b] quinoline derivatives were synthesized through dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivative 4 with the respective 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one substrates using a similar strategy. A gram&#8208;scale experiment successfully yielded 1.95g of 3aa in 85% yield with a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of 10.4/1, ultimately enabling a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances of Vanadium&#8208;based Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8208;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO4 and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Conversion of Tyrosine into a Coumaric Acid Residue at the N&#8208;Terminal Side of an Orexin Peptide Fragment Induced by UV Irradiation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of reactive species exceeding the physiological self&#8208;defense mechanisms in cells and tissues, known as oxidative stress, usually leads to damage of DNA and proteins. In this work, we analyzed the impact of UV irradiation and radical species from different sources to the Tyr17&#8208;Leu33 segment of orexin A peptide, which is the minimal fragment with affinity for orexin 1 receptor. As a clear oxidation process, we detected the conversion of terminal Tyrosine residue into a mixture of E/Z coumaric acid derivatives. In fact, UV irradiation and nitrosyl radicals were found to selectively induce the deamination of tyrosine into the corresponding olefin derivative, which was confirmed by HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR investigations.</dc:description>

Peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents: A hybrid molecular innovation combining scalable synthesis and enhanced solubility. Optimized variant A4B2 excels in thermal stabilization and electron microscopy studies of key membrane proteins, setting the stage for advanced detergent design.







Abstract
Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.

Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein-coupled receptors, including A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;AR, SMO and GLP-1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;AR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide-based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Alkylation Reactions That Construct Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers and Tune C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) Bond Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers that construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, which ease the rotation of the bond between the central chiral carbon and the dihydrobenzofuranone moiety, have been developed. The products have the benefits of the central chiral center and the flexibly rotatable bond to locate a part of the moieties at various positions for interacting with other molecules.







Abstract
In molecules with central chiral centers functionalized with aryl groups, the rotation of the single bond between the aryl group and the central chiral center may be hindered. Enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers to construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters resulting in easing of the rotation around the axes are described. We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Stable Cations and Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread deployment of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) energy conversion devices requires AEMs with robust alkaline stability. In the race for alkaline stability, &#8220;cationic athletes&#8221; are forging ahead, and cyclic ammonium&#8208;based AEMs are emerging as frontrunners. This concept summarizes the current state of development among various alkali&#8208;stable cations, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future developments in this field.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted attention as an innovative technology due to their advantageous alkaline catalytic kinetics and cost&#8208;effectiveness. AEMs play a crucial role in these devices and have shown significant progress in terms of ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, alkaline stability, and other essential characteristics. Nevertheless, their durability remains a limiting factor preventing the large&#8208;scale deployment of AEMs based devices. The attack of hydroxide ions on the cations is an inherent issue that needs to be addressed to enhance the lifetime of the AEMs. Therefore, the design of more stable cationic groups is essential to maintain the initial properties of AEMs and extend the device lifetime. This concept systematically summarizes the development and stability enhancement strategies of the cationic groups for AEMs in recent years, with particular emphasis on the emerging cyclic cationic groups. Furthermore, the stability differences of cations in small molecules versus AEMs are systematically discussed, as well as prospective research toward stable AEMs.

         <title>Novel Space&#8208;Crowded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Molecules for the Fabrication of Efficient Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tailored blue luminscent molecules with through&#8208;space charge transfer feature are synthesized and characterized. They exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence, and can not only function efficiently as emitters in blue OLEDs but also serves as host materials for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitters, providing narrow blue electroluminescence spectra and excellent device efficiencies.







Abstract
Currently, the advance of high&#8208;resolution display device puts a high requirement for the development of efficient luminescent materials emitting high&#8208;quality blue light. But stable blue luminescent materials with high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and narrow emission spectra are still rare. In this work, two efficient blue molecules (mCPTC and 2mCPTC) are developed by linking large&#8208;volume electron donors of 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and electron acceptor of 2,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DPTRZ) on the 3,6&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)carbazole holder through benzene bridges. Their thermal stability, crystal and electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical property, charge transport ability and EL behaviors are thoroughly studied. They hold high structural rigidity and through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics between donor and acceptor, and exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence. They can not only function as emitters in OLEDs to radiate deep blue light, but also serve as efficient hosts for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter v&#8208;DABNA, providing narrow EL spectra and excellent EL efficiencies of 24.21&#8201;%, much higher than those in common host without sensitizers. These results demonstrate the good potentials of these blue molecules in the fabrication of efficient narrow&#8208;spectrum blue OLEDs.

         <title>Identification of Two Distinct Stereoselective Lysine 5&#8208;Hydroxylases by Genome Mining Based on Alazopeptin Biosynthetic Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes that catalyze regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are valuable for pharmaceutical production. Two lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2) that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively, were identified by genome mining. Several lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases in the genome database were also characterized. Stereoselective dehydrogenases for (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine were also discovered.







Abstract
Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed in&#8197;vitro. Here, we identified two &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate/Fe2+&#8208;dependent dioxygenases in Actinosynnema mirum and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine and four lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5&#8208;hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.

         <title>Identification of Natural Killer Cell Enhancers Through Mimicking of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is reduced within the tumor microenvironment (TME), allowing cancer to evade detection and eradication by immune cells. We developed a novel co&#8208;culture assay that replicates the immunosuppressive TME conditions to facilitate the discovery of compounds that can prevent NK cell inhibition and identified effective modulators, with different mechanisms of action.







Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.

&lt;p&gt;The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is reduced within the tumor microenvironment (TME), allowing cancer to evade detection and eradication by immune cells. We developed a novel co-culture assay that replicates the immunosuppressive TME conditions to facilitate the discovery of compounds that can prevent NK cell inhibition and identified effective modulators, with different mechanisms of action.

         <title>Understanding the Photophysical Properties of Pd and Pt Transition&#8208;Metal Isocorroles: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computed photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, allow us to indicate these compounds as possible candidates in photodynamic therapy. In particular, Density Functional Theory results clearly show that the Pt&#8208;10 and Pd&#8208;10 complexes are able to generate of excited O2 (1&#916;g) and superoxide O2.(&#8722;) via type I and type II reactions.







Abstract
The main photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, characterized and proposed as potential photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, have been investigated and rationalized using density functional theory and its time&#8208;dependent formulation. Both the 5 and 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers have been considered. In addition to determining the minimum energy structures of the ground and excited states, we have calculated the excitation energies, spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants, nonradiative intersystem crossing rate constants and two photons cross section. Also, the type I PDT mechanisms have been considered. Results show that the photoactivity of both Pd and Pt complexes mainly depends on their singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, which is necessary to promote the O2

 excitation. The study of the photophysical properties of the free ligands indicates that this trend is common for both the free and Pt&#8211; and Pd&#8211;isocorroles. The production of superoxide ions (O2.(&#8722;)) is possible only for the 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers.

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8722;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium&#8208;Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 reduction to NH3 on Au22Ru6 cluster without sacrificial reagent. The Ru&#8208;doped Au cluster effectively reduces N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium under ambient pressure and temperature conditions owing to the bifunctional nature of that nanocluster. The Ru dopant of the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster assists in binding the N2 molecule while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are involved in facilitating nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecules to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory), we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed to achieve this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are implicated in facilitating NRR.

Crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks can afford high photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane performance.







Abstract
Photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is an appealing approach to produce ethane and hydrogen, however, most developed photocatalysts still suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can afford high photocatalytic NOCM performance in a flow reactor under UV&#8208;visible light irradiation. The characterization results show that engineering the TiO2 crystal phase can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and promote the formation of &#8901;CH3 intermediate, thus achieving the improved performance of photocatalytic NOCM reaction. This research provides a new perspective towards the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for NOCM reaction.

         <title>Adding Value into Elementary Sulfur for Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in synthesis strategy that leverage sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions to produce sustainable materials. The materials have promising applications across energy, optics, engineering, and environmental sectors, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers, characterized by high sulfur contents and dynamic disulfide bonds, show significant promise as sustainable alternatives to conventional carbon&#8208;based plastics. Since the advent of inverse vulcanization in 2013, numerous synthesis strategies have emerged &#8211; ranging from thermopolymerization and photoinduced polymerization to the use of crosslinkers such as mercaptans, episulfides, benzoxazines, and cyclic disulfides. These advancements coupled with the rising demand for degradable plastics have driven research for diverse applications, including optical windows, metal uptake, and adhesives. Due to the unique electronic properties of sulfur&#8208;rich materials, they are promising candidates for cathodes in Li&#8722;S batteries and triboelectric nanogenerators. This review highlight the latest exciting ways of synthesis strategy in which sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions are bing utilized to produce sustainable materials in energy, optics, engeneering material, environemtal, and triboelectric nanogenerators. Finally, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.

         <dc:description>
Dimerization of the boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate complex provides valuable functional luminescence properties, like solvatochromism, mechanochromism and phosphorescence, which are absent in the parent single molecule. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that delicately balanced intramolecular electronic interactions should impart the specific excited state characteristics leading to those luminescent behaviors.







Abstract
We report synthesis and optical properties of the dimers of boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate (DAI) complexes with different connection manners. The series of dimers, o&#8208;, m&#8208;, p&#8208; and d&#8208;BisDAI, were prepared, and their photophysical properties were compared with the single unit, DAI. It was found that the dimers show characteristic optical properties: o&#8208;BisDAI showed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and emission quenching because of the through&#8208;space interactions, while the photophysical properties of m&#8208;BisDAI and DAI were almost identical. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation in p&#8208;BisDAI could induce not only the bathochromic shifts of its absorption and emission bands but also the solvatochromism originating from the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer character. d&#8208;BisDAI showed the weak low&#8208;energy emission in solution and the mechanochromic luminescence which might stem from the rotational degree of freedom between the adjacent two DAI units.

&lt;p&gt;Dimerization of the boron &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-dialdiminate complex provides valuable functional luminescence properties, like solvatochromism, mechanochromism and phosphorescence, which are absent in the parent single molecule. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that delicately balanced intramolecular electronic interactions should impart the specific excited state characteristics leading to those luminescent behaviors.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fine Tuning of Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States and Luminescence in Carbazole/Benzothiadiazole Isomeric Emitters by Varying Linking Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By varying the linkage of carbazole donor from 3&#8208; to 2&#8208;site onto the benzothiadiazole acceptor in two isomeric HLCT emitters, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle is reduced, which not only reduces the HOMO delocalization and the charge transfer effect and causes fluorescence blue shift by 30&#8197;nm, but also increases molecular rigidity and improves PLQY to about 90&#8201;%. Green doped OLED of 2&#8208;site isomer exhibits high EQE of 5.79&#8201;%, being one of the best efficiencies for green HLCT materials based on benzothiadiazole acceptor.







Abstract
Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) type emitters can harvest triplet excitons for light emission via high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC), showing great potential for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, two isomeric emitters NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD were developed by linking two 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (NPC) donors onto the central benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD) acceptor. By tuning the linkage from 3&#8208;site to 2&#8208;site of carbazole ring, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle was decreased, then the HOMO delocalization and CT/LE content ratio in HLCT excited states were reduced, thus NPC2BTD revealed fluorescence hypsochromic shift by 30&#8197;nm to green region. Simultaneously, the molecular rigidity was increased and non&#8208;radiative transition was suppressed, thus the photoluminescence quantum yield was increased to about 90&#8201;%. Their HLCT excited state nature was verified by the natural transition orbitals results and detection of two different excited dipole moments in various solvents. It is supposed the hRISC occur from T2 to S1 states. Yellow and green doped OLEDs of NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD exhibited external quantum efficiencies of 5.31&#8201;% and 5.79&#8201;% with exciton utilization efficiency of 36.12&#8201;% and 32.42&#8201;%. The superior performance of NPC2BTD over NPC3BTD was attributed to the finely tuned HLCT excited states through structure isomerization.

         <title>Base&#8208;Induced Apparent Inverted Solvatochromism in Pyridinium Phenolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of base choice on the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes was investigated. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra revealed that methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide causes apparent inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made for methodologies used to compare novel solvatochromic dyes against benchmark dyes.







Abstract
Due to conflicting reports regarding the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes, the choice of base (N,N,N&#8216;,N&#8216;&#8208;tetramethylguanidine or 1&#8197;M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol) used to deprotonate the dyes was investigated. Three known dyes were synthesized and their UV&#8208;vis absorbance spectra were measured in a range of solvent using the two bases and the zwitterionic forms of the dyes. It was found that the methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide could cause the appearance of inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes when used in solvents of sufficiently low polarity. This was attributed to the presence of the polar, hydrogen bond donating methanol which preferentially solvates the dye, increasing the polarity it observes. Informed by these results, recommendations are presented for the methods used to compare solvatochromic dyes.

We report how with simple spectroscopic technic we could obtain clear evidence of narcissistic H&#8208;bonds self&#8208;sorting during supramolecular polymerization of a judiciously designed monomer endowing urea and amide functions.

In this study, we unambiguously evidence, by mean of UV&#8208;Vis and NMR technics supported by theoretical calculations, that a narcissistic H&#8208;bond self&#8208;sorting takes place during supramolecular polymerization of a newly designed monomer equipped with mixed urea/amide H&#8208;bond donor/acceptor moieties.

         <title>Isolation of a Rare Terminal Zr(IV) Peroxide and Insight into Polyoxovanadate Support Impact on Thioether Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lability of a terminal methoxide on a zirconium&#8208;doped polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) is demonstrated through pKa driven reactions. Single crystals of the decorated ZrPOV&#8208;alkoxide are reported which include a rare monomeric Zr&#8208;peroxo species. The POV metalloligand serves as an electron&#8208;rich scaffold allowing the Zr to engage in electrophilic oxidation of thioethers via hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.







Abstract
Substitutional lability of the terminal methoxide ligand on a Zr(IV) substituted polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) via protonolysis is presented. Addition of excess water or stoichiometric 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol results in the exchange of the terminal methoxide ligand for a hydroxide or 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxide ligand, respectively. The lability of the terminal methoxide ligand at zirconium is leveraged to access a relatively stable terminal peroxide bound to a POV&#8208;alkoxide supported Zr(IV) center, via addition of hydrogen peroxide adducts compatible with organic solvent. Isolation of the terminal peroxide complex allows for investigation into the impact of the sterically protected, electron&#8208;rich POV&#8208;alkoxide support on the activation of hydrogen peroxide at Zr(IV). While the isolated peroxide complex is inactive towards the oxidation of thioethers, the methoxy terminated Zr(IV) functions as a precatalyst for the reaction. Mechanistic analysis reveals electrophilic oxidation conditions with hydrogen peroxide substrates, with a nucleophilic parameter (

 ${{{{\bf\chi}}}_{{\bf N u}}}$



) of 0.09&#177;0.02. In thioether oxidation reactions, selectivity for sulfoxide products (95&#8211;99&#8201;%) in acetonitrile is observed, suggesting the use of a reduced POV&#8208;alkoxide prevents over&#8208;oxidation of substrate.

         <title>Adjustability and Versatility of Molecular Packing Patterns in Asymmetric Coumarin Liquid Crystals Supramolecular Helical Column Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals were synthesized using click reaction. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. DFT calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, FMOs, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.







Abstract
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals (LCs) were synthesized using click reaction, with coumarin core and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dendritic wings on both sides. The properties of these LCs and the resulting gels were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These polycatenars demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into columnar LCs phases, exhibiting p4&#8197;mm symmetry in their bulk states. In DMF solvent, ether compounds yield gels with notably more ordered, spherical flower&#8208;like morphologies, while ester compounds produce gels that are less ordered and exhibit a nanosphere morphology. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. Interestingly, the 2 was proved as promising imaging probe for latent fingerprints (LFPs) and fluorescent fingerprints images were obtained with high&#8208;resolution, which showed potential practical application for LFPs detection. Additionally, LCs compounds are used as dopants to modify the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS) injection layer of Organic silicone&#8208;based heterojunction solar cells (HSCs). Finally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO3 as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO3 is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re&#8208;understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has emerged to a powerful electrochemical method for the fabrication of nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Different from traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne is an all&#8208;carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest&#8208;wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures. Experimental results were complemented by calculated absorption and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Elucidation using Highly Sensitive Labeling Reagents and Total Synthesis of a New Anoikis Inducer Amoxetamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amoxetamide A is a new anoikis inducer identified in the combined&#8208;culture broth of Amycolatopsis sp. 26&#8208;4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP&#8208;B0596. Although its planar structure has been determined through extensive NMR studies, its stereochemical structure remains to be elucidated due to the limited amounts of available samples. Herein, we report its stereochemical determination using our original labeling reagents and chemical synthesis, which was realized by consuming trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of amoxetamide A is reported. Undesired intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate accelerated by the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect was completely avoided by using acyl sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its stereochemistry and anoikis inducing activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization.

In particular, we found that the C-terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)-4-mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence.

         <title>Sustainable diesel from rapeseed oil esters by sequential semi&#8208;hydrogenation, double bond isomerization, and metathesis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) have been converted to biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the EN 590 specifications for modern diesel engines using a robust, three&#8208;step process. In the first step, the polyunsaturated esters of the RME were semi&#8208;hydrogenated in the presence of 20 ppm of a solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd0 colloid. The resulting mono&#8208;unsaturated fatty esters were further converted into a defined mixture of double&#8208;bond isomers by passing them over inexpensive, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic Amberlyst resin at high space&#8208;time yields (1.3 kg&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). The resulting mixture was then converted into a blend of terminally unsaturated olefins and monoesters, with &lt;4.9% diesters and &lt;21% saturated fatty esters by cross&#8208;metathesis with technical&#8208;grade ethylene. In this step, 50 ppm of a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) Ru catalyst M1001 was used to achieve record&#8208;setting conversions (91%) and selectivities (94%). All three steps were conducted with neat feedstock at mild temperatures (60&#8211;100 &#176;C). This demonstrates that sustainable diesel fuel for use in contemporary diesel engines is accessible from RME and ethylene via a short set of industrially viable reaction steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication and characterization of the composite material [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU is presented. The spin&#8208;crossover iron complex embedded within it efficiently catalyzes the formation of acetal. This catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without significant loss of efficiency. Additionally, the color of the material indicates whether the film can be reused for catalysis or not.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7&#8197;hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Luminescence of Diazapyrene Derivatives upon Complexation with Cucurbit[n]uril Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexation regulates the luminescence of D&#8722;A type diazapyrene radical cations by enhancing their stabilities, prolonging their fluorescence lifetimes, and increasing their quantum yields.







Abstract
Molecular design with an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure and host&#8208;guest complexation are effective strategies for stabilizing radicals. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cationic diazapyrene derivatives featuring a D&#8722;A structure, as well as the influence of host&#8208;guest complexation on their photoinduced organic radical photophysical properties. Compared to the methylated diazapyrene 1, the other three derivatives 2&#8211;4, containing triphenylamine, coumarin, and naphthalene units as D groups, respectively, are more favorable for the generation of radicals. Binding studies reveal that cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with derivatives 2&#8211;4, while CB[10] forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex with 2 and supramolecular polymers with 3 and 4. The radical luminescence of derivatives 1&#8211;4 in aqueous solution is significantly promoted upon complexation with CB[8] or CB[10]. Additionally, the emission color of 3 shifts from cyan to yellow&#8208;green upon light irradiation in the presence of CB[8].

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing&#160;&#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino a&#8208;tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate&#8208;mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox&#8208;neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru&#8208;catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.</dc:description>

The racemic &#945;-tertiary 1,2-diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino a-tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate-mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally-relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox-neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru-catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step- and atom-economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96% yield, &gt;98:2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8208;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: Photo&#8208;Isomerism and Magnetic Properties in Multifunctional Hetero&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Metallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis, structural characterisation, and magnetic properties of hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, denoted as FeNOCuLnCo, (with Ln=Gd, Tb, or Dy). These complexes mark a significant milestone as the first examples of polyfunctional compounds containing four different metallic ions, exhibiting dual properties: reversible photo&#8208;isomerism and single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, FeNOCuLnCo (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo&#8208;isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo&#8208;switching nitroprusside anion FeNO with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the FeNOCuTbCo complex which is one of the few examples of a photo&#8208;isomerisable SMM.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Cis O&#8208;Linked Glycosyl Amino Acids via Additive&#8208;Modulation for Glycopeptide Synthesis</title>

Herein, we developed O&#8208;glycosyl (D&#8208;Glcp, D&#8208;Galp, D&#8208;GlcNAcp, D&#8208;GalNAcp, L&#8208;Fucp, D&#8208;Xylp, L&#8208;Araf, for instance) trichloroacetimidates as glycosyl donors, which can be actived by TfOH with DMF or TBAI as additives, affording the 1,2&#8208;cis linked glycosyl amino acids serve as valuable building blocks for glycopeptide synthesis via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The glycosylation protocol was characterized by its excellent &#945; selectivity and simple operation and broad applicability to various substrates.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective strategy to facilitate the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;O&#8208;linked glycosyl amino acids was established via a additive&#8208;modulated trichloroacetimidate glycosylation approach. This mild and practical protocol demonstrates broad applicability with diverse glycosyl donors, including D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, D&#8208;xylo&#8208;, L&#8208;fuco&#8208;pyranosyl and L&#8208;arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidates, and orthogonally protected amino acids such as Ser, Thr, Tyr, and 4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as acceptors. These 1,2&#8208;cis linked glycosyl amino acids serve as valuable building blocks for glycopeptide synthesis via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), offering significant potential for advancing glycoprotein research.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8211;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8211;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8211;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8211;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8211;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8211;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle.

         <title>Supramolecular Interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;Like Crystals from [4+4] Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of organic cages with 1,3,5&#8208;tribromo arene units have been studied in the solid state. Dimerization of the tribromo arene units by &#960;&#8208;stacking is found, resulting in porous structures as for example depicted here for a truncated [4+4] imine cage. If all four tribromo arene units form dimers, a Faujasite&#8208;type packing can result, which is found as two interpenetrating networks.







Abstract
In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able to control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cage, to study the reliability of this subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.

         <title>Pursuing Heat&#8208;resistant and Insensitive Energetic Materials by Constructing Imino Bridged Conjugated Planar Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing insensitive heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials (compounds 3 and 4) were designed and prepared by incorporating imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) the fused ring of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8722;343.9 &#176;C) and good detonation performances (D: 8183&#8722;8206 m s&#8208;1), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (IS &gt; 40 J, FS &gt; 360 N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound 4 (Td: 343.9 &#176;C, D: 8183 m s&#8208;1, IS &gt; 40 J, FS &gt; 360 N) are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td: 318 &#176;C, D: 7612 m s&#8208;1, IS: 5 J, FS: 240 N), indicating its great potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile&#8208;tolerant Iridium&#8208;catalysed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant homogeneous catalysis methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology delivers high levels of isotopic labelling under mild and practicable reaction conditions via a range of heterocyclic, ketone, and amine directing units.







Abstract
Isotopically labelled molecules are vital tools within drug discovery and are used extensively to assess a given candidate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Related to this, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) has become a prominent technique for the rapid and selective late&#8208;stage installation of a deuterium or tritium label. Despite having a generally wide applicability, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this specific field is limited when particularly co&#8208;ordinating motifs are present within a given molecule to be labelled. For example, the exceptional binding strength and sterically unencumbered nature of the nitrile functionality leads to inhibition of catalyst turnover, and has hindered the development of efficient methods for the HIE of nitrile&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, in silico solvent binding energy parameter approaches have been disclosed which have facilitated the discovery of uniquely tolerant neutral iridium catalyst species that demonstrate a significantly lower binding strength with nitrile functionality. In turn, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant HIE methodology enabled via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology proceeds under mild and practically accessible reaction conditions with a range of directing groups, including heterocycles, ketones, and amines, with this class of catalyst also shown to be applicable towards bioactive molecules, resulting in products with high levels of isotopic labelling.

         <title>Theoretical Study on Binary Monolayers P3S&#8208;I for Photocatalytic Overall Water Plitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P3S&#8722;I monolayer possesses suitable bandgap, appropriate band edge positions, high carrier mobility and large optical absorption coefficients. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can react simultaneously at the P and S atoms, respectively, triggered merely by the photogenerated electrons and holes.







Abstract
The utilization of visible light to split water into H&#8322; and O&#8322; offers a promising solution to address the escalating global energy crisis and environmental pollution. Compared to conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) photocatalysts, anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to their ultrahigh surface area, reduced charge migration distance, and improved efficiency. In this study, we employ a swarm&#8208;intelligence search combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose a novel series of stable 2D phosphorus sulfides, PxSy (x, y=1&#8211;6), as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer exhibits an optimal bandgap (2.485&#8197;eV), appropriate band edge positions (&#8722;3.52&#8197;eV for CBM and &#8722;6.00&#8197;eV for VBM at the HSE06 level), high carrier mobility (3246.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;e along the y&#8208;direction and 1039.80&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;h along the x&#8208;direction), and strong optical absorption coefficients (exceeding 1&#215;10&#8309;&#8197;cm&#8722;1 within the visible spectrum). Notably, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are facilitated concurrently at the P and S sites, respectively, driven exclusively by photogenerated electrons and holes. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer achieves a high photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting efficiency of 17.7&#8201;% in both acidic and neutral environments. These findings provide theoretical insights into the design of efficient 2D materials for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting.

         <title>Flavanone&#8208;enabled CuAAC Reaction: Noninnocent Reagents Driving a Mononuclear Mechanism Over the Dinuclear Paradigm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction involving a naringenin derivative as both substrate and ligand leads to an efficient process via a mononuclear (Cu&#8208;catalyzed) mechanism, as elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and reliable DFT calculations of the complete free energy profile.







Abstract
In this work, we report the use of the CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition) reaction to obtain different triazole derivatives bridged to the naringenin skeleton, leading to the combination of a triazole pharmacophoric group with a bioactive flavanone. The generation of Cu(I) active species was done using CuSO4 salts and sodium ascorbate, resulting in moderate to high yields when the DMSO&#8208;water binary system was used as solvents. Mechanistic studies were done using density functional theory calculations and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We investigated the reduction process of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and the role of mononuclear and dinuclear copper species in the catalysis of the cycloaddition reaction. Our combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the mechanism involving a single copper species is taking place, with the cycloaddition step being the rate&#8208;determining step. The calculations indicate that the mechanism involving two copper species has the deprotonation of the coordinated terminal alkyne as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Monitoring On&#8208;Surface Chemical Reactions by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Microscopy: from Conformation Change to Ring Closure in 2D Molecular Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing on&#8208;surface synthesis we may prepare molecules that are not achievable otherwise. We follow the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction on the Au(111) surface by low&#8208;energy electron microscopy and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. This provides a key insight for understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a promising strategy for the preparation of molecules that are not achievable otherwise. Understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions requires knowledge of the molecular structure and possible organization of reactants into supramolecular assemblies during the reaction. Scanning probe techniques are essential for the unambiguous identification of the products and for determining their electronic and magnetic properties. However, these are generally not capable of imaging the surface at reaction conditions and, therefore, answering some of the key questions about the reaction mechanism. Here, we show that real&#8208;time low&#8208;energy electron microscopy (LEEM) can monitor the surface processes in real time and provide the necessary complementary mechanistic insights into on&#8208;surface reactions. We monitor the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(7&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)benzene on the Au(111) surface and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. Products condense into separate islands upon cooling, enabling fast and efficient assessment of product yields. This makes LEEM an efficient tool for studying intramolecular chemical reactions.

We report an efficient protocol for the site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at C7 position over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. We further show that gem&#8208;dihaloketones can be synthesized from terminal alkynes in a facile manner using NXS/TBHP reagent system.







Abstract
We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.

         <title>Tuning the Efficiency of Iridium(III) Complexes for Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis through Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of heteroleptic Iridium(III) complexes, which can act as Energy Transfer (EnT) photocatalysts, has been prepared and tested in photochemical transformations. Our study explores ligand design and its impact on the photophysical properties of the complexes and their catalytic performance. Naphthyl pendants enhance triplet intermediate stabilization in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions, leading to superior catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photoactive Iridium(III) complexes are a popular synthetic tool. The impact of ligand design on their photoredox properties has been widely studied, but similar approaches to develop more potent photosensitizers are still absent. We report herein the preparation, characterization and catalytic application of a new family of Iridium(III) complexes that proved superior to their widely&#8208;used commercial peers. The best results were observed when naphthyl pendants were installed to the ligands, which could stabilize the triplet intermediates involved in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions.

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2 Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We provide a detailed analysis of the nitrogen reduction mechanism on the pristine and oxygen defective (012) surface of CuFeO2. DFT+U calculations examine the stability of reaction intermediates and provide mechanistic insights. Beyond that, we shed light on the active sites&#8217; orbital contributions and the oxygen defects&#8217; electronic impact.

 (CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface. To find the thermodynamic stable pathway, the associative Heyrovsk&#253; mechanism was considered, containing four different reaction pathways. The reaction intermediates predominantly interact with the iron sites on the surface, following the distal alternating reaction pathway via the formation of hydrazine. Introducing oxygen defects changes the reaction mechanism to a Mars&#8722;van&#8208;Krevelen&#8208;type mechanism, avoiding the formation of hydrazine, while the Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation step is lowered by 1.17&#8197;eV (from 2.17 to 1.00&#8197;eV). Analyzing the charge density distribution reveals that an oxygen defective surface enables CFO to facilitate a

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling Assisted Synthesis of Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction enabled the formation of monofluoroalkenes with yields up to 99&#8201;%. The solid&#8208;state reaction condition allowed the formation of a broad scope of trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted fluorinated alkenes (48 examples) with the use of a weak base and a short reaction time from aldehydes of ketones. Moreover, the reaction conditions proved to be broadly applicable to various fluorophosphonoacetates, providing access to valuable fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
A solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable monofluoroalkenes was developed under ball&#8208;milling agitation. The use of 1.0&#8197;equivalent of carbonyl substrates and 1.1&#8197;equivalent of fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with a weak inorganic base enabled the formation of the desired products after 30&#8197;min of reaction under sustainable conditions with minimized synthetic waste. No sequential addition of base, fluorophosphonate, and carbonyl substrates was needed, and the desired products were obtained with high purity only after a simple filtration. The protocol showed general efficiency and tolerance to a large panel of carbonyl substrates including aldehydes and ketones, as well as fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with moderate stereoselectivities and yields ranging from 21&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% (48 examples).

         <title>Delayed Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence from a Liquid Arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homotruxene, a promising class of twisted polycyclic aromatic compounds, had its structure modified by insertion of branched alkoxy chains, resulting in the first report of a neat liquid presenting Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation at room temperature, as well as phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms.







Abstract
Delayed emission (DF) of fluorescence is generally observed either in solution or in the crystalline state. In the latter, well&#8208;defined intermolecular interactions may play a significant role in defining the emission characteristics. Here, we present a trialkoxy&#8208;homotruxene that is liquid at room temperature and compare its emission behavior with that of a crystalline analog containing the same &#960;&#8208;electron system. The DF observed is due to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) and persists at low temperatures (90&#8197;K). Accompanied by slightly shorter phosphorescence and DF lifetimes, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap increased by 4&#8201;% compared to the crystalline homolog. The replacement of methyl groups with racemic branched alkoxy chains in homotruxene derivatives proves efficient in suppressing crystallization without significantly altering DF. In neat films, the compound exhibited TTA&#8208;DF at room temperature, phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms and Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY) of 24&#8201;%. Thus, TTA&#8208;DF persists in a single&#8208;component isotropic liquid phase, showing both molecular and aggregate emissions, only slightly affected by the absence of periodic molecular stacking.

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective metalation of the macrocyclic biquinazoline (Mabiq) ligand via exposure to a cobalt atom beam was realized on the Ag(111) surface, causing complete transformation of the self&#8208;assembly packing arrangement. This work reveals the promise as well as possible hurdles for constructing a bimetallic network based on the Mabiq building block.







Abstract
The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal atoms, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation, which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material&#8217;s inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R = &#8208;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.</dc:description>

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT Using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72 h to 5 min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8208;11 kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.</dc:description>
