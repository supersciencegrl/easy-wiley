         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a  deuterium rush  owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. Here, we show that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanode for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly&#8208;shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Time and Atom Economical Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Radical Cyclization of Unactivated 1,6&#8208;Enynes Under Metal&#8208; and Oxidant&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

Chemical economics! Highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds were synthesized from unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes and sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions. These transformations can minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practical aspects compared to exiting protocols.







Abstract
We developed time&#8208;atom economic regio&#8208; and chemoselective sulfonyl radical triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes with sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions to achieve highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds. This transformation creates three new bonds, such as C&#8722;SO2, C&#8722;C, and active C&#8722;I/Br bonds. Importantly, one&#8208;pot protocols produce desired products directly from sodium sulfinates and have an additional advantage such as minimising chemical waste, saving time, and simplifying practical aspects compared to existing protocols.

         <title>Significant Effect of the Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on the Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with a Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains is important for proximity in the stacking of porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated through a fourfold rotaxane linkage. This picture shows a chochin, a Japanese lantern made with paper and thin strips of bamboo that can be expanded and contracted flexibly. This foldability recalls the induced molecular interaction in the flexible molecular conjugate. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200819).

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What will my product be? Selectivity and activity maps can be used to predict and rationalize reaction outcomes based on catalyst and solvent choice. Here, there utility is demonstrated by examining competing carboamination/cyclopropanation reactions catalyzed by Group 9 catalysts featuring cyclopentadienyl ligands, which reveals an interesting energetic interplay involving the role of the solvent and of the catalyst.







Abstract
Group 9 metals, in particular RhIII complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8722;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with N&#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, CpXMIII (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*RhIII catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (e.&#8201;g., replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.

         <title>Chemically Modified Poly(A) Analogs Targeting PABP: Structure Activity Relationship and Translation Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotide mRNA poly(A) tail analogs containing various nucleotide modifications were evaluated as binders for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) using a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay. Their susceptibility to specific degradation by CNOT7 deadenylase was also examined in order to identify best stabilizing modifications. Analogs exhibiting highest affinity and stability were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and proved to act as efficient translational inhibitors with potential applications in mRNA&#8208;related research.

Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oligonucleotide mRNA poly(A) tail analogs&lt;/b&gt; containing various nucleotide modifications were evaluated as binders for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) using a microscale thermophoresis-based assay. Their susceptibility to specific degradation by CNOT7 deadenylase was also examined in order to identify best stabilizing modifications. Analogs exhibiting highest affinity and stability were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and proved to act as efficient translational inhibitors with potential applications in mRNA-related research.

Tuning by timing: The photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling was achieved using a simple white LED combined with a triphenylphosphine ruthenium&#8211;arene complex bearing an azobenzene ligand. The strategy developed in this work involves the photo&#8208;controlled release of metal catalyst activator (PPh3) through Z&#8208;to&#8208;E azobenzene isomerization, thus generating competent Pd0 active species, and allows fine tuning of reaction kinetics according to irradiation time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;release of triphenylphosphine from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8211;arene complex was exploited to activate PdIICl2 into Pd0 catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; by using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate by changing the irradiation time. Various substrates were successfully applied to this photo&#8208;initiated cross&#8208;coupling, thus illustrating the wide functional&#8208;group tolerance of our photo&#8208;caged catalyst activator, without any need for sophisticated photochemistry apparatus.

         <title>Assembly of &#1013;&#8208;Keggin Polyoxometalate from Molecular Crystal to Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the formation process of zeolitic octahedral metal oxides (ZOMOs) shows that controlling Ni content, reducing agent, and synthesis time &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8208;based ZOMOs or molecules. The zeolitic nickel molybdates are effective for C2 hydrocarbon separation.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8211;based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides have been synthesized. 31P NMR spectroscopy shows that reduction of MoVI&#8208;based molybdates forms an &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to the solid phase. Investigation of the formation process indicates that a low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na+ is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C2 hydrocarbon mixtures.

         <title>The Significant Role of the Atomic Surface Structure of Support in Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General strategies for tailoring SMSI, including classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, and various SMSIs after complex treatments are summarized in this concept. Moreover, a new proposal, considering both the exposed facets of support and the interaction with gas, is presented to alter the property of the support to tune SMSI. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, oxidative, or other complex properties.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes, different kinds of SMSI, such as classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI, can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, the challenges faced at present are discussed and useful insights for future research concerning this topic are provided.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br) nanosheets with a thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligands and ZrCl4. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets have emerged as a promising kind of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP=5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm were assembled and aggregated into a flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared by a similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework's affinity towards CO2.

A carp (alkyne) swimming up a waterfall falling from a legendary mountain (energy gap that is hard to jump without photoexcitation) accepts a pearl (alkyl radical) prepared by an oyster (Ir photoredox catalyst) under sunlight irradiation and becomes a dragon with a pearl in its mouth (Markovnikov&#8208;type product) or in its claws (anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type product) after going through different longmen or dragon gates (different Ni catalysts). The comparison is based on a myth popular in East Asian countries. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Nishibayashi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200727).

         <title>Triangular Arrangement of Ferromagnetic Iron Chains in the High&#8208;TC Ferromagnet TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacks of alternating (Fe/Os)3 triangles induce ferromagnetic ordering at elevated temperatures in the new transition metal boride TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2. The Curie temperature TC=523(2)&#8197;K and the Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K reflect the strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions within and between the Fe3 triangles as found by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal borides (TMBs) containing Bn&#8208;fragment (n&gt;3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B4&#8208;containing TiFe0.64(1)Os2.36(1)B2 is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2)&#8197;K and a Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K, originating from the chain of M3&#8208;triangles (M=64&#8201;%Fe+36&#8201;%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc&#8208;melting, and its structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti1+xOs2&#8722;xRuB2&#8208;type structure (space group P
2&#8197;m, no. 189) and contains trigonal&#8208;planar B4 boron fragments [B&#8722;B distance of 1.87(4)&#8197;&#197;] interacting with M3&#8208;triangles [M&#8211;M distances of 2.637(8)&#8197;&#197; and 3.0199(2)&#8197;&#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs2B2 composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe3&#8208;triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os&#8208;rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low&#8208;dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.

         <title>Electrochemistry and Reactivity of Chelation&#8208;stabilized Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their promising properties, hypervalent bromine(III) reagents remain underexplored due to their low stability and difficult preparation. A fresh approach involves chelation&#8208;stabilized bromine(III) species which are conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of parent bromoarenes. The intrinsic Br(III) reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. In this mechanistic study, electrochemical synthesis, redox properties, and chemical reactivity aspects of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) species are disclosed.







Abstract
Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard&#8208;to&#8208;control and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF3 as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiopharmaceuticals: Since the macrocyclic gold standards used in nuclear medicine are not suitable to Pd(II) coordination, its radioisotopes remain understated for radiopharmaceutical applications. The monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA presented here is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, opening avenues to enrich the current palette of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted radiotherapy.







Abstract
The limited use of palladium&#8208;103 and &#8208;109 radionuclides for molecular radiotherapy is surely due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all criteria required for application in nuclear medicine. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of these complexes in solution remain difficult to establish. The challenge is compounded when considering that radiolabeling of compounds for translation to clinical trials requires fast complexation. Thus, the coordination of Pd(II) and 103/109Pd&#8208;nuclides is a huge challenge in terms of molecular design and physicochemical characterization. Herein, we report a comprehensive study highlighting TE1PA, a monopicolinate cyclam &#8211; already established in nuclear imaging with 64Cu&#8208;PET (positron emission tomography) imaging tracers &#8211; as a highly relevant chelator for natural Pd and subsequently 109Pd&#8208;nuclide. The structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and radiolabeling studies of Pd(II) with TE1PA, as well as the comparison of this complex with three structurally related derivatives, support palladium&#8208;TE1PA radiopharmaceuticals as leading candidates for targeted nuclear medicine.

The catalytic enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anions generated through the formal umpolung addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement was demonstrated with chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.







Abstract
The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A last piece of the puzzle? A method that significantly expands the diversity of molecules built in crystals by using principles of supramolecular chemistry is introduced. The approach relies on post&#8208;modification of aryl nitriles, which serve a dual role as hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to support intermolecular photodimerization and as organic functional groups that can undergo a variety of chemical transformations (e.&#8201;g., click reactivity). More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;R. MacGillivray and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200978).

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable with orthogonal dynamic covalent semicarbazone chemistry, 310 helical peptide templates are introduced as a general chemistry tool to enable and tame unfavorable ring&#8208;opening polymerizations by dynamic covalent disulfide and diselenide exchange cascades.







Abstract
A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP). The tool consists of 310 helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers. With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively. Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting. Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of four natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, was developed through a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processes without any intermediate purification. The overall yields and enantioselectivities obtained in this novel integrated flow platform were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min.







Abstract
Continuous flow synthetic technologies had been widely applied in the total synthesis in the past few decades. Fully continuous flow synthesis is still extremely focused on multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8722;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8722;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min, corresponding to a throughput of 145&#8197;mg/h.

The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reliable Functionalization of 5,6&#8208;Fused Bicyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles Pyrazolopyrimidines and Imidazopyridazines via Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>

N&#8208;heterocycles, pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines were reliably functionalized with the support of DFT &#8208; calculations using Grignard reagents as nucleophilic partners and TMPZn&#8208;mediated zincations for 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. Successive regioselective magnesiations with TMPMgCl&#8901;LiCl or TMP2Zn&#8901;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 for the 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine scaffold provided a range of highly functionalized new N&#8208;heterocycles of pharmaceutical interest.







Abstract
DFT&#8208;calculations allow prediction of the reactivity of uncommon N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazines and considerably facilitate their functionalization. The derivatization of these N&#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine, bases such as TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.

         <title>Remote Effect from Boron Cluster: Tunable Photophysical Properties of o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Based Luminogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design strategy that attaches the o&#8208;carborane group to the remote side of luminogens was proposed. The remote effect from the o&#8208;carboranyl unit on the end of luminogens could significantly modulate the photophysical properties in both solution and the solid state. The carborane&#8208;substituted luminogens show lower luminescence efficiency in solution and longer emission wavelength in the solid state in contrast to those of model compounds.







Abstract
We proposed a new molecular design strategy that the o&#8208;carboranyl group is attached as &#8220;an innocent unit&#8221; to the remote side of luminogens to tune photophysical properties. To verify this strategy, two o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based compounds with asymmetric molecular geometry were designed and synthesized. Photophysical properties of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based luminogens were investigated on the basis of UV&#8208;Vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the o&#8208;carboranyl group has a slight effect on the energy gap between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) in the solution state but a significant effect on the energy gap between S0 and S1 in the solid state. Besides, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition processes are modulated by the o&#8208;carboranyl unit. This leads to emission quenching in the solution state but an enhanced luminous efficiency in the aggregate state with a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine&#8208;bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.







Abstract
Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work which combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions between a Noble Metal and a Polyfunctional Aromatic Ligand: Ag+(benzylamine)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
IR multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy unveils the structure of the Ag+(benzylamine) complex (Ag+(BA)), presenting a N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960; chelate coordination involving both the amino nitrogen and the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(BA) with neutral molecular ligands (L) confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and indicates an augmented silver coordination in the Ag+(BA)(L) adduct.







Abstract
The structure of an isolated Ag+(benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8211;1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system of the phenyl ring. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion

         <title>Enantioselective Cytotoxicity of Chiral Diphosphine Ruthenium(II) Complexes Against Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral cationic diphosphine ruthenium(II) complexes [RuX(CO)(PP)(phen)]Y (X, Y=carboxylates, thioacetate, PP=(R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos), isolated as single stereoisomers, inhibit cancer cell proliferation and colonization with EC50 values ranging from 2.8 to 0.04&#8197;&#956;M, the (R,R)&#8208;enantiomers being up to 14 times more active than the (S,S) ones. In water, the (S)&#8208;cysteine and GSH adducts are easily formed from the carboxylate derivatives via aquo complexes.







Abstract
The chiral cationic complex [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]OAc (2R), isolated from reaction of [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(CO)] (1R) with phen, reacts with NaOPiv and KSAc affording [RuX(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]Y (X=Y=OPiv 3R; X=SAc, Y=OAc 4R). The corresponding enantiomers 2S&#8208;4S have been obtained from 1S containing (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of 2R and 2S with (S)&#8208;cysteine and NaPF6 at pH=9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((S)&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF6 (PP=(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos 2R&#8208;Cys; (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos 2S&#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for 2R with (S)&#8208;cysteine in H2O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of 2R&#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9&#8201;% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their n&#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505&#8197;C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549&#8197;cell lines with EC50 values of 2.8&#8211;0.04&#8197;&#956;M. The (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers, 4R (EC50=0.04&#8197;&#956;M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than 4S against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505&#8197;C cell line.

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size effects: Ionothermal condensation of dicyandiamide in alkali halide salt melts leads to the formation of extended 2D, layered frameworks only in the presence of small halides such as chloride, and bromide. With increasing size of the alkali halide intercalate, stabilizing van der Waals interactions between extended, &#960;&#8208;conjugated triazine&#8208;based sheets are lost. The main, crystalline product from an alkali iodide eutectic was identified as melem hydrate, a heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based, hydrogen&#8208;bonded, monoclinic solid.







Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, the synthetic protocols and properties are compared for two types of carbon nitride materials &#8211; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &#8211; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C3N3)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. Melem hydrate, obtained as single&#8208;crystalline powders, was compared with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic was rationalized via density functional theory calculations. This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.

         <title>Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interlaced mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder&#8208;free electrode exhibited a superior NH3 yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principles calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e&#8208;NRR performance of this binder&#8208;free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel&#8208;based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder&#8208;free carbon felt electrodes for use in e&#8208;NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic Cyclobutenes through Desulfinative Spirocyclisation of gem&#8208;Bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes</title>

Spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] framework is effectively constructed from easily available biaryl&#8208;alkynes through a two&#8208;step protocol including selective (2+2) cycloaddition with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Tf2C=CH2 and HFIP&#8208;promoted desulfinative spirocyclisation.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] compounds from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf2C=CH2 followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.

&lt;p&gt;A two-step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene-1,9&#8242;-fluorene] compounds from biaryl-alkynes and 2-(2-fluoropyridin-1-ium-1-yl)-1,1-bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan-1-ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl-alkynes and Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene-1,9&#8242;-fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Xantphos&#8208;Type Rhodium Complexes Towards SF4: SF3 Versus SF2 Complex Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>

S&#8722;F bond activation: Treatment of the xantphos&#8208;type rhodium complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] with SF4 gave the &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5]. Its molecular structure in the solid state reveals a Rh&#8722;F interaction of the SF3 ligand with the metal center. Further reactions with Lewis acids and chlorine sources have been investigated.







Abstract
S&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation of sulfur tetrafluoride at [Rh(Cl)(tBuxanPOP)] (1; tBuxanPOP=9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;xanthene) led to the formation of the cationic complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (2&#8201;a) together with trans&#8208;[Rh(Cl)(F)2(tBuxanPOP)] (3) and cis&#8208;[Rh(Cl)2(F)(tBuxanPOP)] (4) which both could also be obtained by the reaction of SF5Cl with 1. In contrast to that, the conversion of SF4 at the methyl complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] (5) gave the isolable and room&#8208;temperature stable cationic &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (6). Treatment of 6 with the Lewis acids BF3 or AsF5 produced the dicationic difluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4]2 (8&#8201;a) or [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][AsF6]2 (8&#8201;b), respectively. Refluorination of 8&#8201;a was possible with the use of dimethylamine giving [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4] (9). A reaction of 6 with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TClCA) gave the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][Cl] (2&#8201;b) together with chloromethane and SF5Cl.

         <title>Enantioselective Organophotocatalytic Telescoped Synthesis of a Chiral Privileged Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8208;flow catalytic enantioselective organophotoredox alkylation of aldehydes has been successfully developed (up to 98&#8201;% e.e.) and applied to the fully telescoped synthesis of a chiral active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), consisting of four units of operation: in&#8208;flow asymmetric benzylation, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and oxidative amidation. By using flow technologies, the productivity was increased by almost 200 times compared to the batch reaction.







Abstract
The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom&#8208;designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10&#8197;mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000&#8201;% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of four units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95&#8201;% e.e.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>

Water wire transfer: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self&#8208;organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.







Abstract
Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the P61 chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization&#8208;driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air&#8208;stable crystalline form readily obtained under a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH&#8230;&#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water inside the chiral channel under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively under biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.

Chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules result from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

More information can be found in the Research Article by A. van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202200383"&gt;10.1002/chem.202200383&lt;/a&gt;).

         <dc:description>
An effective two&#8208;step synthesis for spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] has been developed that allows the arrangement of substituents on three mutually orthogonal axes (triaxes), represented as the right/left hand of Fleming's rules. This unique molecular scaffold leads to new designs of functional small molecules and macromolecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Hoshikawa, H. Yanai and T. Matsumoto (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200704).

         <dc:description>
Synthetic transformations of close&#8208;packed structures have witnessed a budding renaissance with the use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions. Surprising pathways to many new multifunctional and metastable solids have been discovered by leveraging the ion mobilities within their underlying sublattices. Recent research has begun elucidating many of the key synthetic variables, such as highlighted in the article frontispiece.

         <title>Conversion of CH4 Catalyzed by Gas Phase Ions Containing Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review article discusses the significant progress that has been made for catalytic methane conversion in the gas phase, with focus on the coupling reactions of CH4 molecules and of CH4 with other substrates (O2, O3, N2O, CO2, and H2O) catalyzed by ions containing metals. The mechanistic details for generation of C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8208;O coupling products from methane have been provided at a strictly molecular level.







Abstract
Methane is an abundant and cheap feedstock to produce valuable chemicals. The catalytic reaction of methane conversion generally requires the participation of multiple molecules (such as two or three CH4 molecules, O2, CO2, etc.). Such complex process includes the cleavage of original chemical bonds, formation of new chemical bonds, and desorption of products. The gas phase study provides a unique arena to gain molecular&#8208;level insights into the detailed mechanisms of bond&#8208;breaking and bond&#8208;forming involved in complicated catalytic reactions. In this Review, we introduce the methane conversion catalyzed by gas phase ions containing metals and three topics will be discussed: (1) the direct coupling of methane molecules, (2) the conversion of CH4 with O2, O3 and N2O, and (3) the conversion of CH4 with CO2 and H2O. The obtained mechanistic aspects may provide new clues for rational design of better&#8208;performing catalysts for conversion of methane to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Hydrated HNDPA is a highly robust example of chiral symmetry breaking, which is an extremely rare phenomenon.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200383).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the collaborative research team coordinated by Arie van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee at the University of Montpellier. The image depicts chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules resulting from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

         <title>Fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole for peptide labeling through P&#8208;N bond formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8208;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitutes a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits on HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes in reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study we aim to: (1) study the convergence of the activation free energy, using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study; and (2) provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were observed to contribute to this step. Here we used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations, which led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0 kcal&#183;mol  &#8208;1  . Furthermore, the present simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active site water molecule was proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving atomic&#8208;scale defects in conjugated polymers on&#8208;surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here we deliberately introduce isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer and carefully examine its local density of states on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Our scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, our results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Adamantyl Side&#8208;Chains as Anti&#8208;aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1% (Short&#8208;circuit current = 8.3 mA cm&#8208;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage = 1054 mV, Fill factor = 0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part I: Synthesis of Hauser Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ Grignard  Metalation Method (  i  GMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot procedure to quickly produce multigram amounts of  Hauser  bases R  2  N&#8208;MgBr which are valuable and vastly used metalation reagents and novel electrolytes for magnesium batteries. During addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and secondary amine at room temperature in an ethereal solvent, a smooth reaction yields R  2  N&#8208;MgBr under evolution of ethane within a few hours. A  Schlenk  equilibrium is operative, interconverting the  Hauser  bases into their solvated homoleptic congeners Mg(NR  2  )  2  and MgBr  2  depending on the solvent. Scope and preconditions are studied, and side reactions limiting the yield have been investigated. DOSY&#8208;NMR experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structures of characteristic examples clarify aggregation in solution and the solid state.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainability: This comprehensive review showcases the unique reactivity features of bifunctional isopropenyl esters (iPEs), such as sopropenyl acetate (iPAc), bearing an ester moiety, suitable for irreversible transesterification reactions, while the isopropenyl unsaturation reacts selectively in electrophilic and/or radical additions, as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, iPEs can be successfully employed for direct biomass modification (i.&#8201;e., lignin or cellulose) and in tandem esterification&#8208;acetalization reactions.







Abstract
The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (C&#8722;, O&#8722;, N&#8722;, S&#8722;, Se&#8722;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (i.e. lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption of ATO NCs in the near&#8208;infrared region due to the Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au NPs around 530 nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (  d  Au  ) at 5.3 nm &#8804;  d  Au  &#8804; 8.2 nm. Light irradiation (  l  ex  &gt; 660 nm, ~0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction more than two times with ~95% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of ~ 30 K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In this research article we bring a new methodology&#8230; that enables the so&#8208;far elusive DRA reaction between purely aliphatic ketones and amines.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201078).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Matthieu Jouffroy from Discovery Process Research at Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. and the group of Rafael Gramage&#8208;Doria at the University of Rennes. The image depicts an Ir&#8208;based catalytic system &#8220;fueled&#8221; by hydrogen for the direct reductive amination of ketones and secondary amines, allowing complex aliphatic tertiary amines to be prepared and, so, new chemical space to be reached.

         <title>Nonbonding/Bonding Molecular Orbital Regulation of Nitrogen&#8211;Boron&#8211; Oxygen&#8208;embedded Blue/Green Multiresonant TADF Emitters with High Efficiency and Color Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen (N&#8211;B&#8211;O), exhibiting colortunability between blue and green, namely NBO , m&#8208;DiNBO , and p&#8208;DiNBO . The three emitter materials showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 96%/25 nm, 87%/17 nm, and 99%/19 nm, respectively. For m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO , the emission color could be tuned from blue to green by regulating the nonbonding/bonding molecular orbital characters. Owing to the expanded planar molecular structure, m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO showed high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;) of 88% and 92%, respectively. OLEDs were prepared with NBO , m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO , exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8%, 24.2%, and 21.6%, respectively. NBO and m&#8208;DiNBO exhibited pure&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. p&#8208;DiNBO showed pure&#8208;green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).</dc:description>

2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes participate in three&#8208;component, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;promoted hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reactions with aldehydes and protected amines to produce functionalized piperidenes. The advantages of this method include the stability of the enol phosphate functional group in both the 1,3&#8208;diene starting material and in the cycloaddition product, its ease of use as no special solvent or atmosphere manipulations are required, and the synthetic usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group as an electrophilic cross&#8208;coupling partner after the cycloaddition.







Abstract
The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in&#8197;situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.

         <title>H2, B&#8211;H, and Si&#8211;H bond activation and facile protonolysis driven by Pt&#8722;base metal cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H 2  , B&#8211;H and Si&#8211;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8211;H&#8211;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe 2  /M 2+  with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me group at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light at various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.</dc:description>

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones is described. The methodology, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enatioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones and silanes is reported. The reaction, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex (Rh2((S)&#8208;BTPCP)4), furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (27&#8211;97&#8201;%), high diastereoselectivities (68&#8201;:&#8201;32 to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and moderate to excellent ee (40&#8211;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers a privileged access to an underexplored class of enantioenriched cyclopropanes with a high level of functionality, an asset for further post&#8208;functionalization and their incorporation into more complex structure.

         <title>Binding of VIVO2+, VIVOL, VIVOL2 and VVO2L Moieties to Proteins: X&#8208;ray/Theoretical Characterization and Biological Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacologically active VIVOL2 complexes (L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, picolinato) undergo hydrolysis, exchange of ligands, and redox processes to form VIVOL2/VIVOL/VVO2L/VIVO2+&#8722;protein adducts with lysozyme and trypsin, with the binding of Asp, Asn, and Ser residues, that might contribute to their biological activity. X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational studies suggest the critical role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the stabilization of these structures.







Abstract
Vanadium compounds have frequently been proposed as therapeutics, but their application has been hampered by the lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and with enzymes. Herein, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound VIVO2+ and VIVOL2+, where L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with VIVO(picolinato)2 and VVO2(phen)+ moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and microsolvation in stabilizating the structure. Noteworthy is that the trypsin&#8722;VVO2(phen) and trypsin&#8722;VIVO(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies, thus suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. The obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of VIV and VV complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and the formation of different adducts that might contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widen our knowledge of vanadium&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Driving the Active Site Incorporation in Zeolitic Materials via the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Through Development of H&#8208;Bonds with Hydroxyl Groups</title>

(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped aluminophosphates is able to control the spatial distribution of low&#8208;valent dopants through the development of H&#8208;bonds with MgO4 tetrahedra, providing a new strategy for controlling the active site spatial distribution in zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) was used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO4 tetrahedra. This work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented method allows the preparation of ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylarenes utilizing a heterobimetallic catalytic system of nickel and copper. The protocol represents an advantage over traditional palladium catalysed Suzuki coupling due to the short reaction times and the use of earth&#8208;abundant metals.







Abstract
A convenient method for the direct ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids via nickel&#8208;copper co&#8208;catalysis is disclosed. This work, which utilizes inexpensive first row transition metals, represents a facile alternative to the traditional palladium catalyzed approach. The method utilizes inexpensive commodity chemicals and substrates while tolerating a variety of biologically relevant functional groups. Structurally diverse phosphonodifluoromethylarenes are furnished in good yields under short reaction times. Control experiments to probe possible reaction pathways are also included.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of the Bioactive Fragment of Salbutamol and Derivatives in a Self&#8208;Optimizing Flow Chemistry Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a photochemical route towards an important &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol using a self&#8208;optimizing flow chemistry platform is reported in this work. The methodology enables rapid construction of 2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The implementation of self&#8208;optimizing flow reactors has been mostly limited to model reactions or known synthesis routes. In this work, a self&#8208;optimizing flow photochemistry platform is used to develop an original synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Reactions of Mesityl Azide with Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Germylenes, Stannylenes and Plumbylenes, Including PPh2&#8208;Functionalised Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active PbII/P Lewis pair nature of a PPh2&#8208;functionalised ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic plumbylene is demonstrated by its reaction with mesityl azide to afford a phosphazide, which is in contrast to the inertness of the unfunctionalised congener. The lighter analogues most likely react with MesN3 at their respective tetrel atom EII, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit, followed by NMes transfer from the EIV to the PIII atom.







Abstract
The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}E] (E=Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN3) is compared with that of PPh2&#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reaction sites, namely the EII and PIII atom. For E=Ge and Sn the reaction occurs at the EII atom, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit. The germanimines are sufficiently stable for isolation. The stannanimines furnish follow&#8208;up products, either by [2+3] cycloaddition with MesN3 or, in the PPh2&#8208;substituted case, by NMes transfer from the SnIV to the PIII atom. Whereas [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}Pb] and other diaminoplumbylenes studied are inert even under forcing conditions, the PPh2&#8208;substituted congener forms an addition product with MesN3, thus showing a behaviour similar to that of frustrated Lewis pairs. The germylenes of this study afford copper(I) complexes with CuCl, including the first structurally characterised linear dicoordinate halogenido complex [CuX(L)] with a heavier tetrylene ligand L.

         <title>Radical complexes of nickel(II)/copper(II) and redox non&#8208;innocent MB&#8208;DIPY ligands: unusual stability and strong near&#8208;infrared absorption at lmax ~1300 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000 nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8208;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at l max ~ 1300 nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] + (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] &#8208; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] . radicals was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight on their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with an MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass and Charge Transfer Enhancement during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CO2  reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass transfer limitations hinder the step forward seriously. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2&#160;  without organics barrier layer, facilitating the mass transfer of CO2  to catalysts and the charge transfer. With less charge transfer obstruction, higher CO2  , and lower H+  surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced up to 247.15 &#956;mol g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  . Furthermore, we investigate the mechanism of fluorination by experiment and theoretical calculation. Overall, enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Hot Carrier Transfer at Plasmonic Au/Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing heterostructures have been demonstrated as an ideal strategy for boosting charge separation on plasmonic photocatalysts, but the detailed interface charge transfer mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we fabricate plasmonic Au and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, NH 2 &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125 used in this work) heterostructures and explore the interface charge transfer mechanism by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The plasmon&#8208;excited hot electrons on Au can transfer across the Au/MOF interface and be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of secondary building units (Ti 8 O 8 (OH) 4 cluster) of the MOF structure, and the plasmon&#8208;excited hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand (1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate&#8208;NH 2 ). The spatially separated hot electrons and holes exhibit boosted the photocatalytic activity for chromium (VI) reduction and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. This work illustrates the advantage of the versatile functionalization of MOF structures enabling molecular&#8208;level manipulation of interface charge transfer on plasmonic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, three strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism, including:&#160;  a) metal cataly  z ed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects and, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized  ad hoc  four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting  vs.  spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8211;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy enables the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into oligopeptides that have already been constructed, including into a macrocyclic peptide. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nanjo, Y. Takemoto, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201120).

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene ( 1 ) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960; 14 a +&#960; 2 s ] process that afforded only the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by virtue of an edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S&#8208;shape of 1 . The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis &#8208; and trans &#8208;cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis &#8208;cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p),&#160;SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, while a stepwise mechanism involving addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8217; or C7&#8217; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1 . These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract : Reactions of PAr 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (Ar = o &#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8208;3 in which P&#8208;N and B&#8208;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh 3 , PPh 3 and DEAD gave the product 4 where P&#8208;N and N&#8208;B binding was confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31 P and 11 B NMR parameters.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antidote Discovery by Untangling the Reactivation Mechanism of Nerve&#8208;Agent&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of efficient antidotes to organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication needs to account for the complexity of the molecular system. A fragment with broad&#8208;spectrum binding profile was transformed into a multi&#8208;active reactivator of OPNAs&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterases. Reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics, supplemented with structural data show that efficient reactivation is linked to longer residence time, and reveal that the OPNAs dictate both the initial binding and the structural prerequisites for the reactivation reaction.







Abstract
Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;aryl thioformates, or thioCORMates, are versatile carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) for a range of uses, from carbonylative cross coupling to protein binding. These molecules can be tuned to release CO at different rates (from &lt;1&#8197;min to &gt;1&#8197;h) at room temperature. Isotopically labeled 13CO can also be generated easily, since thioCORMates are made in one step from the corresponding thiophenol and formic acid.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base, S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8208;from less than 1&#8197;min to greater than 1&#8197;h&#8208;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled 13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from 13C&#8208;formic acid.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-aryl thioformates&lt;/b&gt;, or thioCORMates, are versatile carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) for a range of uses, from carbonylative cross coupling to protein binding. These molecules can be tuned to release CO at different rates (from &amp;lt;1&#8197;min to &amp;gt;1&#8197;h) at room temperature. Isotopically labeled &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO can also be generated easily, since thioCORMates are made in one step from the corresponding thiophenol and formic acid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross-coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench-stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates-from less than 1&#8197;min to greater than 1&#8197;h-offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-formic acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Pursuit of Perphenylterphenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl was prepared in low yield by two methods: (1) Ullmann coupling of pentaphenyliodobenzene and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and (2) Diels&#8208;Alder addition of tetracyclone and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene. Its X&#8208;ray structure shows it to possess an unusual conformation with two boat&#8208;shaped benzene rings.







Abstract
Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (2) was synthesized from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene (11) by two methods. Ullmann coupling of 11 with pentaphenyliodobenzene (9) gave compound 2 in 1.7&#8201;% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of 11 with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne 12 with tetracyclone (6), gave 2 in 1.5&#8201;% overall yield. The latter reaction also gave the monoaddition product 4&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (13) in 4&#8201;% overall yield. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds 2 and 13 show them to possess core aromatic rings distorted into shallow boat conformations. Density functional calculations indicate that these unusual structures are not the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase and may be the result of packing forces in the crystal. In addition, while uncorrected DFT calculations indicate that the strain energy in compound 2 is approximately 50&#8197;kcal/mol, dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations suggest that it is essentially unstrained, due to compensating, favorable, intramolecular interactions of its many phenyl rings. An attempted synthesis of tetradecaphenyl&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl (4) by reaction of diphenylhexatriyne (14) with three equivalents of tetracyclone at 350&#8201;&#176;C gave only the diadduct 2&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (15) in 17&#8201;% yield. Even higher temperatures failed to produce 4 and lowered the yield of 15, perhaps due to rapid decomposition of the starting materials. Ullmann coupling of 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diiodobenzene (16) and compound 9 also failed to give compound 4.

         <title>Para&#8208;Fluorination of Anilides Using Electrochemically Generated Hypervalent Iodoarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical transformation for the selective para&#8208;fluorination of anilides is presented. Herein, anodically generated ArIF2 mediates the conversion of a variety of 20 different anilides in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The sustainable and easy to conduct protocol in an ionic&#8208;liquid / dicholoromethane mixture represents a promising alternative to conventional reagent mediated synthesis protocol.







Abstract
The para&#8208;selective fluorination reaction of anilides using electrochemically generated hypervalent ArIF2 is reported, with Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5HF serving as fluoride source and as supporting electrolyte. This electrochemical reaction is characterized by a simple set&#8208;up, easy scalability and affords a broad variety of fluorinated anilides from easily accessible anilides in good yields up to 86&#8201;%.

The use of cheap and readily available Eosin Y as a photocatalyst under mild energy efficient conditions bypassing the use of external oxidants forms the chief highlight of the work.

         <title>The mechanism of biochemical NO&#8208;sensing: insights from computational chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binding of small gas molecules, such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from  Shewanella oneidensis  (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent interactions involving group 6 in biological systems: The case of Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we propose to coin the term Wolfium bond (WfB) to refer to a net attractive force (noncovalent interaction) between any element of group 6 and electron donor atoms (neutral molecules or anions) and to differentiate it from a coordination bond (metal&#8211;ligand interaction). We provide evidence of the existence of this interaction by inspecting the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of proteins containing Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8211;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of  ab initio  calculations (RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.</dc:description>

The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8211;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of  ab initio  calculations (RI-MP2/def2-TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents.&#160;NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H  4  qp4 reacts with H  2  O  2  to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two  para  &#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the  T  1  &#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H  2  O  2  using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H  2  O  2  , in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activations of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds  via  HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by the deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of the present review is to cover the recent developments of synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained via a tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)  2  ]  2  . These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly in&#8208;plane deformed from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, studied by  1  H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side&#8208;product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring parallelly to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms are analysed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh  2  Cl  2  , in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions, lying approximately in&#8208;plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh  2  Cl  2  unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of new morphinan opioids by the addition of photochemically generated carbon&#8208;centered radicals to substrates containing an enone in the morphinan C&#8208;ring, is described. Using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst, diverse radical donors can be used to prepare a variety of C8&#8208;functionalized morphinan opioids. This work demonstrates the late&#8208;stage modification of complex, highly functionalized substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared spectroscopy elucidates the inhibitor binding sites in a metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from  Rhodobacter capsulatus  catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO  2  at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO  2  and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding. The absence of the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587 hampers exclusively the competitive interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here we report the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs. We show that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Substituted Triptycenes: Understanding the Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable host system: Azobenzenes have been attached to a triptycene scaffold in the meta position. Isomerization experiments revealed efficient switching of azobenzene moieties together with the build&#8208;up of a cavity in the all&#8208;Z conformation of the C3v&#8208;symmetric trisazobenzene&#8208;triptycene; this makes this molecule interesting as a switchable host system. Moreover, computational studies indicated excitonic coupling resulting in different transition probabilities of &#960;&#8211;&#960;* excitations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of azobenzene&#8208;substituted triptycenes. In their design, these switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp3 center. The azobenzene switches were prepared by Baeyer&#8211;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to the different transition dipole moments of the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. Transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered, which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which have high potential as energy or information storage systems, or, among others, in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Understanding the reshaping of fluorinated polyester vitrimers by kinetic and DFT studies of the transesterification reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Our group recently reported catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in a&#8208; or b&#8208;position. In the present contribution, we present parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amaryllidaceae alkaloids appeal to organic chemists with their attractive structures and their impressive antitumor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. We demonstrate a highly versatile access to this family of natural products. A general protocol with high yields in a sustainable electro&#8208;organic key transformation on a metal&#8208;free anode to spirodienones facilitates functionalization to the alkaloids. The biomimetic syntheses start with the readily available, inexpensive biogenic starting materials methyl gallate, O&#8208;methyl tyramine, and vanillin derivatives. Through known dynamic resolutions, this technology provides access to both enantiomeric series of martidine, (epi&#8208;)crinine, siculine, and galantamine, clinically prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8208;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans &#8208; and cis &#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Look at Molecular and Electronic Structure of Homoleptic Diiron(II,II) Complexes with N,N&#8208;Bidentate Ligands: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new factors governing the molecular and electronic structures of Fe&#8722;Fe bonded diiron(II,II) complexes were revealed based on comprehensive experimental characterization along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;intio calculations. We present the unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric complex [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], and the new electronic configuration of paddlewheel&#8208;type compound [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4].







Abstract
Paddlewheel&#8208;type binuclear complexes featuring metal&#8722;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.&#8201;e., switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Model calculations determined that the Mayer bond orders for Fe&#8722;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from AB Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending &#960; system of polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedure. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from AB type monomer. The key step in the realization of hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group. Through Barbier reaction between organohalide and ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens and exhibit intriguing luminescent properties, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. While, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen, if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting system are carried out. This work therefore expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymer through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of intellectual properties, concerning about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence cannot realize. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite is likely to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emission. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  and showed resultant emission at 560 nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increasing from 290 nm to 330 nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza  &#8208;o&#8208;  QM intermediates, including its the aza&#8208;  para  &#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;  p  &#8208;QM), aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;AQM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;QM analogs. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;assembly Behavior of the Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  3a  ,  5  ,  8  ,  15a  have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules  3a  and  15a  bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound  3a  shows offset packing arrangements of (  P  5  )&#8208; and (  M  5  )&#8208;isomers, and  15a  has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison,  8  exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42 &#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.</dc:description>

         <title>New approaches toward building Csp&#8208;P bond, a two&#8208;decade overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the review of Savignac, the past 20 years have seen significant progresses on the synthesis of alkynylphosphorus compounds considerably expanding the original and rather limited organic toolbox. This comprehensive review explores the latest and potentially greener methodologies using sustainable catalysis or direct metal&#8208;free couplings from stable and easy to handle precursors. Recent progresses and mechanistic insights for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a particular emphasis on copper, palladium, nickel and silver catalytic systems, photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free reactions are detailed covering most of the publications related to this field since 2000 until March 2022.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) complexes and their use as pre&#8208;catalysts for the activator&#8208;free, gold&#8208;catalyzed addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes (metal = Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) is explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs are structurally characterized and the gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs are screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic pre&#8208;catalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf = O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF  = 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8211;, OTf&#8211;, BArF4&#8211;  ) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the  1H NMR shift of the NH  protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0  &#8594;S1  transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclosed the  contra  &#8208;thermodynamic  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of  rac  &#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH  3  CN under irradiation at 405 nm allowed the interconversion of the  E  &#8208;isomer into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding  Z  /  E  selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomeric DNA Strand Displacement with &#945;&#8208;D Oligonucleotides as Invaders and Ethidium Bromide as Fluorescence Sensor for Duplexes with &#945;/&#946;&#8208;, &#946;/&#946;&#8208; and &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. New anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechaistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1 , 2 ( a&#8208;d ), 3 , 4 . The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct ( AH ) and transfer hydrogenations ( ATH ). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH , respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH , in contrast to previous studies on related systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and Azobenzenes, a Profitable Liaison: Straightforward Synthesis of Photoswitchable Thioglycosides with Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable properties: A direct thioarylation of azobenzenes allows to obtain symmetrical as well as challenging unsymmetrical conjugates in good yields. Importantly, photochromic and thermal relaxation properties can be easily tuned via oxidation of the sulfide linkage.







Abstract
Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one&#8208;pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light, were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.

         <title>Teaching an Old Compound New Tricks: Reversible Transamidation in Maleamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible transamidation is described for different maleamic acids. Amide formation and exchange proceed to equilibrium at room temperature without external catalysts, and the equilibrium composition can be controlled using different stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic compositions can be accessed by amide libraries produced in this way. This new dynamic bond can be useful in dynamic combinatorial chemistry.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this field and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in &#946;&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use different preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access different library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.

Lastly, we use different preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access different library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cesium&#8208;Fluoride&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different structurally unique thio&#8208;organocesium compounds have been synthesized through a mild, one&#8208;step reaction employing CsF as a cheap source of cesium. This article also highlights the importance of their ambident character to control the divergent synthesis of stable sulfonium ylides and c&#8208;arylation products. Furthermore, fine tuning of these substrates (lacking &#945;&#8208;CH protons) helped in the preparation of various ortho&#8208;bifunctional arenes. As an advantage, reactions in one pot helped to promote the reactions through insertion mechanism to ortho&#8208;functional arenes.







Abstract
Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 40&#8201;&#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, lack of internal hydrogen on the cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion products.

         <title>Engineering PdIr Nanostructures Synergistically Induced by Self&#8208;assembled Surfactants and Halide Ions for Alcohol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electrocatalyst engineering: Engineering PdIr nanostructures synergistically induced by self&#8208;assembled surfactants and halide ions were realized to prepare different architectures, including ultrathin nanodendrites (NDs), solid nanosheets (NSs), connected nanorings (NRs), nanoflowers (NFs), and multiply concave nanocubes (MCs). These highly anisotropic structures not only expose rich unsaturated sites, but also protect Pd sites from toxicity and electrical corrosion, which synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metallic nanocatalysts with distinct nanostructures and composition is still a noteworthy topic in the electrochemistry field. In this work, we have realized the morphological evolution of PdIr nanostructures in aqueous solution through the synergistic effect of self&#8208;assembled functional surfactants and different halide ions, and achieved precise control of the kinetic and thermodynamic crystalline growth due to the different reduction potential between PdCl42&#8722;, PdBr42&#8722;, and PdI42&#8722;. The actual precursors of PdCl42&#8722; resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdClxBr(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdClxI(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure&#8208;directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.

         <title>Tricyanoborane&#8208;Functionalized Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Adjustment of Charge and Stereo&#8208;Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tricyanoborane group is a highly promising substituent for the design of versatile building blocks. The introduction of one and two B(CN)3 groups at the N atoms of the N&#8208;heterocyclic core of NHC ligands results in a successive increase in &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability in conjunction with a tuning of the ditopic coordination properties.







Abstract
The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (2) was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)3&#8208;methylimidazole adduct 1. Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion 2 closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (IIb). The influence of the number of N&#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on 2, IIb, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe, IIa). Therefore NHC 2, which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] yielding alkylated imidazoles 3 and 4, the anionic selenium adduct 5, and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 8, respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%Vbur) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be effectively fine&#8208;tuned via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.

         <title>Circular Polarized Luminescence in 1D Manganese(II) Chloride Hybrids Induced by Chiral Amino Acid Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular polarized luminescence (CPL) materials attract great attentions owing to their extensive applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in CPL materials of lead(II) perovskites, we have successfully attained CPL&#8208;active hybrids D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese(II) chloride. As demonstrated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the as&#8208;formed hybrids consist of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl 6 octahedra, surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646 nm with PLQY of 67.1 % for D&#8208;type and 57.2% for L&#8208;type, which are among the highest rank of PLQY in 1D Mn(II) hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1&#180;10 &#8208;3 and &#8208;6.3&#180;10 &#8208;3 for D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 , respectively. The obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids enabled by combining metabolic engineering and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, we combined genetically&#8208;engineered  Escherichia coli  fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene, and metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone,  cis  &#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8208;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. We also elucidated that the  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereoelectronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400 &#176;C, up to 100 bar H  2  ), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165 &#176;C in 3&#8208;6 h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8208;95% using only 15% excess of KH per a C&#8211;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me  2  DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000 ppm to &lt;3 ppm (165 &#176;C, 20 h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich 3,4&#8208;Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water&#8208;Stability, Bio&#8208;macromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) through synthetic optimisation and postsynthetic halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties  . In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically by the use of functionalised linkers.  Herein, we show that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by (i) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous, and (ii) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. As well as providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, we show that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.</dc:description>

         <title>A Radical/Iminium Domino Strategy (RIDS) for Rapid Construction of Sterically Congested &#947;&#8208;Lactam&#8208;based Multiheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multi&#8208;heterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multi&#8208;heterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multi&#8208;cyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dinuclear, electrochemically twofold&#8208;reduced RuRh complexes differing only in the linker chemistry between the two metal spheres are compared. Whereas the alkyne linker offers a simple trail in a flat region between the metal centers for both electrons and protons, the triazole linker, represented by a large mountain, blocks the passage of electrons between Ru and Rh. However, even in case of the mountainous triazole trail, the holes find their way between Ru and Rh. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Dietzek&#8208;Ivan&#353;i&#263; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200490).

         <dc:description>Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group which, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning their properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is proposed. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement have been performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive and metal&#8208;free synthesis method has also been described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid  1  that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between  1  &#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when  1  &#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid  1  exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as the potential aqueous Zn&#8208;storage cathode materials are under the research spotlight because of their facile 2D ion&#8208;transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. In this concept article, we summarize the intrinsic structural features and aqueous Zn&#8208;storage mechanisms of the TMDs&#8208;based electrodes. More significantly, the latest design concepts of TMDs materials for high&#8208;performance AZIBs are discussed in detail from three aspects of interlayer expansion engineering, phase transition engineering, and structure defects engineering. Finally, the current challenges facing TMDs cathodes and possible remedies are outlined for future developments towards efficient, rapid, and stable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of homolytic X&#8208;H bond cleavage by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex was investigated computationally. Both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds are cleaved via a concerted proton coupled electron transfer mechanism (cPCET) rather than a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT). The results suggest that one&#8208;electron events at gold may be more accessible than anticipated.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;H and O&#8722;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8722;H cleavage step proceeds via concerted proton coupled electron transfer (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) centre and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 17236&#8211;17244), which proceed via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8722;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8722;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8722;OH and Au&#8722;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8722;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au centre, for which only limited examples exist.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting a handle on diversification: Aryl nitriles have been used to support hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly in the solid state to achieve an intermolecular photodimerization. The resulting tetrafunctionalized cyclobutane is amenable to rapid diversification as demonstrated by a post&#8208;click modification. The integration of aryl nitriles as supramolecular handles allows the self&#8208;assembly process to be programmed for post&#8208;modification and conversion of the product to a wide variety of molecules.







Abstract
A method to rapidly diversify the molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced, with aryl nitriles playing a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described. The general concept is demonstrated by using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and by hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.

         <title>Hydrogenative Catalysis with Three&#8208;Coordinate Zinc Complexes Supported with PN Ligands is Enhanced Compared to PNP Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity of bidentate three&#8208;coordinate Zn(II) complexes towards hydrogenation of model ketone and imine substrates is enhanced compared to the analogous tridentate PNP system. DFT calculations and experimental evidence point towards a sigma bond metathesis mechanism, instead of aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity, with the lack of trailing P&#8208;arm enabling the enhancement.







Abstract
This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistency: 87 measurements across 10 independent junctions between four solvents and using the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge ILSB have furnished accurate silver ion Gibbs transfer energies between water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide that are consistent within 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These form the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry.







Abstract
Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge to measure Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent 
&#8208; and the 
 values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the 
 value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This 
 scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling a straightforward comparison of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvents&#8242; redox potential scales. Thus, using the Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion published herein, one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured, for example, against ferrocene, to the 
 scale.

         <title>Adaptable Optical Microwaveguides From Mechanically Flexible Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bent waveguides, especially, singly and doubly bent waveguides are essential for the advancement of photonic technologies. Here, two chemically and optically different flexible organic crystals were fabricated into singly and doubly&#8208;bent shapes from straight geometry using micromechanical manipulation technique to demonstrate optical waveguiding behavior which is required for photonic circuit applications. (Atomic force microscopy cantilever tip abbreviated as AFM cantilever)







Abstract
Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (1), and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (2). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules 1 and 2 display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL), respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals 1 and 2 exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals 1 and 2, confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#160;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards diabetes therapeutic agents: Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;mediated supramolecular modulation of islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation is demonstrated. CB[7] efficiently interacts with different amino acid residues at the N&#8197;terminus &#8220;hot segments&#8221; and alters IAPP aggregation. This type of macrocycle&#8208;based approach has the potential for the development of type&#8197;2 diabetes therapeutic agents.







Abstract
Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within an islet amyloid polypeptide are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type&#8197;2 diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random&#8208;coil conformation. A HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] likely modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8197;terminus. CB[7] also prevents the formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;Pyridylethynyl)Arenes &#8211; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;viologens containing &#960;&#8208;extended bis(N&#8208;methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to 1O2 generation within cells.







Abstract
A series of bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity.

All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi&#8208;faceted features, in combination with its two&#8208;photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methyl-viologens containing&lt;/b&gt; &#960;-extended bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one- and two-photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation within cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of bis-(4&#8217;-pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;-extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&amp;lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two-photon absorption cross-section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds-DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene-analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells.

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed Fe atoms on a porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) are realized by a facile and scalable matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging. Benefitting from highly accessible Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, Fe&#8722;SA/NCF delivers boosted oxygen reduction activity and stability via a near four&#8208;electron path, which further demonstrates potential application in zinc&#8208;air batteries, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging is demonstrated to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8722;N4 moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9&#8197;wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.

         <title>Diverse Supports for Immobilization of Catalysts in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supports for immobilization of catalysts in flow reactors are outlined, with emphases on sustainable binding with channel walls and catalysts, boosted catalysts loading and ability to maintain fine flow properties. Particularly, the synergy of supports and catalysts are discerned, as well as the specific designs. In addition, fabrication of array&#8208;like catalytic supports and application of advanced fluidic devices are included.







Abstract
The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway has been uncovered. The crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA. It follows the classical mechanism at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements, but turns to the reversed crystal growth at a high ratio. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Yue, M. Opanasenko and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200590).

         <title>Revisiting the Environment Effect on Mass Transfer for Heterogenized Pd6Ru8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Photocatalyst Confined within 3D Matrix</title>

Water directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix.







Abstract
Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et&#8197;al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd6Ru8 (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 remains with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, providing a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid) &#8211; Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane with a gradient content distribution of organic cage crystals throughout the membrane was prepared. The composite membrane allows for rapid diffusion of iodine vapor, leading to an outstanding iodine uptake capacity. Furthermore, such porous membrane can be processed into membrane modules for trace iodine vapor capture and interception, revealing its great potential for practical application.







Abstract
The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and CC3 crystalline powder (662&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Dielectric Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material with Mid&#8208;Band Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) with two&#8208;step dielectric response, meanwhile, it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PbI4] (Compound 1, BA=n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA+), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28&#8197;eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350&#8197;K and 460&#8197;K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, and bioapplications of all the probes are presented. Further challenges and instructions for new ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8722; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probes offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as real&#8208;time and nondestructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; in live cells or in&#8197;vivo, which involves chemical structures, response mechanisms, and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.

Abstract
Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, &#960;+&#8208;&#960;+ interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes, the putative intermediates of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.







Abstract
Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior.

The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step.

     alt="2-Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au-Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes&lt;/b&gt;, the putative intermediates of Au(I)-catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au-catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas-phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2-aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au-catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well-characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2-aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au-catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non-competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au-proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Flavonoid&#8208;Cinnamic Acid Amide Hybrids with Distinct Activity against Neurodegeneration in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavonoid&#8208;cinnamic acid amides were synthesized and evaluated in phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration. The compounds prevent cell death in models of oxidative stress and energy breakdown. The introduction of an amide yielded higher stability towards hydrolysis and altering the flavonoid core structure showed that the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide hybrid was the most potent compound, and its in&#8197;vitro properties could be translated into high activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model.







Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural products and have shown significant potential as disease&#8208;modifying agents against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), with activities even in&#8197;vivo. Hybridization of the natural products taxifolin and silibinin with cinnamic acid led to an overadditive effect of these compounds in several phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration and AD. Therefore, we have exchanged the flavonoid part of the hybrids with different flavonoids, which show higher efficacy than taxifolin or silibinin, to improve the activity of the respective hybrids. Chemical connection between the flavonoid and cinnamic acid was realized by an amide instead of a labile ester bond to improve stability towards hydrolysis. To investigate the influence of a double bond at the C&#8208;ring of the flavonoid, the dehydro analogues of the respective hybrids were also synthesized. All compounds obtained show neuroprotection against oxytosis, ferroptosis and ATP&#8208;depletion, respectively, in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Interestingly, the taxifolin and the quercetin derivatives are the most active compounds, whereby the quercetin derivate shows even more pronounced activity than the taxifolin one in all assays applied. As aimed for, no hydrolysis product was found in cellular uptake experiments after 4&#8197;h whereas different metabolites were detected. Furthermore, the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide showed pronounced activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model at a remarkably low dose of 0.3&#8197;mg/kg.

Enantiomerically pure anti N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azidoacetyl thioimides are efficiently prepared through a direct aldol reaction from N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and a wide array of aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2&#8211;6&#8197;mol% [Tol&#8208;BINAP]Ni(II) complexes. The straightforward removal of the heterocyclic scaffold facilitates their conversion into a variety of chiral intermediates. Indeed, treatment of the resultant thioimides with &#945;&#8208;amino ester hydrochlorides gives access to the corresponding dipeptides as well as the appropriate manipulation of the azido group yields peptidic fragments of kasumigamide and atrutamycin.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric triisopropylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TIPSOTf) mediated aldol reaction of N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral nickel(II)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP complex has been developed (BINAP=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl). The catalytic protocol gives the corresponding anti &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy adducts with outstanding stereocontrol and in high yields. Theoretical calculations account for the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and lay the foundations for a mechanistic model. In turn, the easy removal of the thiazolidinethione yields a wide array of enantiomerically pure derivatives in a straightforward and efficient manner. Such a noteworthy character of the heterocyclic scaffold together with the appropriate manipulation of the azido group open a new route to the synthesis of di&#8208; and tripeptide blocks containing a &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid.

2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene platforms for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency host materials for green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24&#8201;% EQE and 104&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a macrocyclic peptide.







Abstract
Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.
