         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Air and Water Stable Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene Stabilized Phosphenium Cation: Reactivity and Selective Fluoride Ion Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present the synthesis and reactivity of the BICAAC&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cation, which is air and moisture stable and exhibits selective fluoride binding.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of an air and water stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) stabilized phosphenium cation (1) is reported. Air and water stable phosphenium cation are rare in the literature. Compound 1 is obtained by reaction of BICAAC with Ph2PCl in THF followed by anion exchange with LiOTf. The reduction and oxidation of 1 yielded corresponding &#945;&#8208;radical phosphine species (2) and BICAAC stabilized phosphenium oxide (3) respectively. All compounds are well characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The Lewis acidity of compounds 1 and 3 are determined by conducting fluoride ion affinity experiments using UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry and multinuclei NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited selective binding to fluoride anion but did not interact with other halides (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to understand the structure and nature of bonding interactions in these compounds, as well as to comprehend the specific bonding affinity to fluoride over other halide ions.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Models for Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0): Additional Substrate Classes, Solvents, and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative structure&#8208;reactivity models for the oxidative addition of more than 100 (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides to Pd(PCy3)2 reveal how the molecular structure of the substrate affects reaction rate. The models can also help identify mechanistic changes between a typical 3&#8208;centered mechanism and a polar nucleophilic displacement mechanism.







Abstract
Quantitative molecular structure&#8208;reactivity models are useful for generating predictions to guide synthesis design, and in formulating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. We report an expanded multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the rate of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to L2Pd(0), here exemplified by Pd(PCy3)2. This builds on a prior model from our group, with additional substrate classes (aryl chlorides and iodides) and reaction solvents (THF, toluene, THF/DMF mixture). Overall solvent effects across the entire substrate set are minimal under these conditions, enabling a unified MLR model without introduction of new molecular descriptors beyond the original five. Examining the mechanistic origin of the two molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) descriptors led to generation of a simpler, four descriptor model that is suitable for aryl halides, but not for 2&#8208;halopyridines. Using this model we identified a mechanistic outlier, 2&#8208;pyridyl triflate, which undergoes a nucleophilic displacement oxidative addition that does not involve the adjacent nitrogen atom. Finally, we discuss the relationship between C&#8722;X bond strength and oxidative addition rates, and compare the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) to bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) as a bond strength descriptor.

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent identity influences the rate and site&#8208;selectivity of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 in several ways. Substrates with H&#8208;bond donating groups are deactivated in polar solvents with high solvent hydrogen bonding basicity, whereas electron deficient substrates and aryl triflates undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents.







Abstract
We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8722;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8722;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8722;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridyl halides.

         <title>N2H4 Derived Sulfonic Acids: Hydrazine Disulfonate, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;, and Hydrazine Iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;</title>

Insertion of SO3 molecules into the N&#8722;H bonds of hydrazine, N2H4 lead to the hydrazine disulfonate [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; and the hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722; anion, respectively. The salts of these new anions have been characterized comprehensively, including thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazinium sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine leads to the pyridinium salt of the hydrazine disulfonate anion, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;. The salt is the starting material for the preparation of further hydrazine disulfonates, for example of alkaline metals and barium. In all compounds, the [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; anion adopts the gauche conformation. The conformer is chiral but all of the investigated compounds crystallize as racemates. The disulfonate anion can occur in another constitution with the two sulfonate groups attached to only one nitrogen atom. This so&#8208;called hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;, has been prepared through a substitution reaction between potassium imidodisulfonate, K2[HN(SO3)2], and hydroxylamine&#8208;O&#8208;sulfonic acid, H2NOSO3H. The hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate anion has been crystallized as potassium and barium compound, respectively. The compounds were characterized by XRD, vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.

         <title>Pd/C&#8211;Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;Monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective commercially available carbon supported palladium (Pd/C)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;monomethylation of Urea derivatives is achieved using Methanol as both a hydrogen (H2) and methyl (C1) Source. This one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology presents an alternative route for the synthesis of mono&#8208;methylated amines from urea derivatives via transfer hydrogenation.







Abstract
N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in&#8197;situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.

         <title>Gold Meets Selenium: Dual Activation of Selenium&#8208;Containing Propargyl Alcohols Towards the Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double gold catalyzed reaction using propargylic alkynes containing selenium. With this procedure chromenes and chromenones could be accessed. Studies between the reactivity of gold and selenium were performed.The gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from propargyl selenoalkynes and phenols is reported. Mechanistic studies by NMR and HRMS support a dual role of the gold catalyst both as a Lewis and &#960;&#8208;acid to enable the title reaction. Key to the success of the reaction is the initial activation of the propargyl alcohol, ultimately leading to a selenium&#8208;stabilized vinyl cation.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from selenoalkynes and phenols. In this cascade reaction, the applied gold catalyst not only functions as a &#960;&#8208;acid, but also as a Lewis acid, enabling the propargylic substitution in the first step to connect the oxygen carbon bond. Under the optimal reaction condition a total of 26 chromenes were accessible by this modular access. During scale up experiments, the hydrolysis of the vinylselenium substructure to the corresponding chromenones was observed. By revisiting the electron&#8208;rich starting materials, four chromenones were produced following a one&#8208;pot reaction using a single gold catalyst. To better understand the interaction of gold and selenium, a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies were performed, which led to the proposal of a mechanism for this transformation.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen Complexes as DNA Binders and Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated cytotoxic agents are attractive compounds as potential anticancer drugs. A library of 21 platinum(II) complexes is presented together with a systematic study of their DNA binding affinities, photophysical and photochemical properties, cellular imaging and phototoxicity. A lead compound has been identified which is not toxic in the dark against cancer cells, but toxic at nanomolar concentrations upon irradiation.







Abstract
Current anticancer therapies suffer from issues such as off&#8208;target side effects and the emergence of drug resistance; therefore, the discovery of alternative therapeutic approaches is vital. These can include the development of drugs with different modes of action, and the exploration of new biomolecular targets. For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus (e.&#8201;g. light irradiation) to generate cytotoxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non&#8208;canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.&#8201;g. guanine&#8208;quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen complexes (square planar platinum(II) complexes coordinated to tetradentate O,N,N,O&#8208;Schiff base ligands), and the investigation, for all complexes, of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells both in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Altogether, these studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine&#8208;quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.

         <title>Deuteration Degree Controllable Synthesis of Aryl Deuteromethyl Ethers Through Dual photoredox and Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl d1, d2, and d3 methyl ethers are precisely prepared through dual photoredox and thiol catalysis, utilizing inexpensive D2O and CDCl3 as deuterium sources. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without requiring high temperature or high loading of transition metal catalysts, allowing for a wide range of functional groups to be well tolerated.

Herein, we report a facile and efficient deuteration degree controllable method for the preparation of aryl deuteromethyl ethers through dual photoredox and thiol catalysis using phenols as the starting materials and inexpensive D2O and CDCl3 as the deuterium sources. All aryl d1, d2, and d3 deuteromethyl ethers can be precisely prepared with good to excellent yields and deuteration ratios. The reaction operates under mild conditions without the need for high temperatures or high loading of transition metal catalysts, and a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated.

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking nano&#8208;photosensitizer: a core&#8208;shell merocyanine&#8208;azobenzene on gold nanoparticles. This cutting&#8208;edge technology demonstrates remarkable efficacy in generating singlet oxygen. With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, it holds immense potential for advancing phototherapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;nature cavities of crownphyrinoids enable reactivity at distinct porphyrinoid&#8208; or crown ether part of the macrocyclic ligand. Depending on the metal and oxidation level of the macrocycle, they bind cations, yielding monomeric, dimeric, or accordion&#8208;like complexes. The use of a crownphyrin capable of incorporating two metal centres allowed for obtaining heterobinuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity.







Abstract
Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid and the other mimicking the crown ether.

We report on the development of novel dual light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of the supramolecular scaffold and display low levels of operational fatigue upon cyclic treatments with light and oxidative/reductive conditions.







Abstract
We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Por-crownphyrin-art&lt;/b&gt;: Crownphyrinoids&#8212;hybrid macrocycles comprising crown ethers and porphyrin functionalities&#8212;show versatile coordination properties and reactivity. Depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and the type of metal cation, they form several structures resulting from binding one or two metal centres.

Many porphyrinoid&#8208;based photosensitizers experience aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, reducing their activity. However, in some cases, their photodynamic activity is restored after incubation with cells. To better understand these changes, we examined how self&#8208;assembled phthalocyanine derivatives behave in biological media. By analyzing fluorescence lifetime decay in the presence of molecular crowders and bacterial strains, we found that some derivatives exhibited adaptive activity changes, while others remained unchanged. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Galstyan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401305).

         <title>Bioinspired Molecular Scalpel for Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Nanosheet: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategies provide powerful approach to create two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs). These strategies can be grouped into two categories: top&#8208;down exfoliation and bottom&#8208;up assembly. This review discusses their latest development from various perspectives, including composition, structure, morphology, property, potential application and practical challenge.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs) have attracted continued attention in the field of advanced functional materials. Their nanoscale thickness, high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, and abundant accessible active sites, are superior advantages compared with their 3D bulk counterparts. Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategy is a promising method for the creation of 2D MONs, and may solve the current shortcomings of MONs synthesis. This review aims to provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of molecular scalpel strategies and share the results of current development to provide a better solution for MONs synthesis. Different types of molecular scalpel strategies have been systematically summarized. Both mechanisms, advantages and limitations of multiform molecular scalpel strategies have been discussed. Besides, the challenges to be overcome and the question to be solved are also introduced.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in photo&#8208;/electocatalyzed alkene difunctionalization enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization are summarized, which are divided to four sections based on the final terminating step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling, along with selected impressive synthetic examples to showcase the importance of the C&#8722;H radical functionalization&#8208;enabled alkene difunctionalization in synthesis.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling.

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for the cancer treatment. Benefiting from nanomaterial strategies, the limitations of CRISPR&#8208;Cas system for in&#8197;vivo application are dramatically improved and can effectively regulate the tumor microenvironment, which provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenue for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial for cancer progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cells always plunder large amounts of nutrients and release various signals to their surroundings, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cells and the TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterial strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at the genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.

         <title>Distinguishing Organomagnesium Species in the Grignard Addition to Ketones with X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have calculated the X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy of organomagnesium species in solution in the reaction of CH3MgCl with acetone. The spectra provide insight into the oxidation state of magnesium and the changes in the first solvation sphere.







Abstract
The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways. With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH3MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L1&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium. The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction. Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.

         <title>Investigating the Effect of UV Irradiation and TiO2 Addition on Heavy Metal Adsorption by Inverse Vulcanized Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption was explored in this study. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer. The maximum observed adsorption capacity reached 47&#8197;mg/g under these conditions. Notably, the presence of TiO2 and UV exposure did not significantly impact the adsorption of inorganic mercury and gold.







Abstract
Organomercury contamination in wastewater is a longstanding global concern, prompting the establishment of the Mi&#8208;namata Convention in 2013, following the tragic Minamata Bay incident in Japan. Despite numerous proposed solutions, the development of an affordable and convenient adsorbent remains a challenge. Sulfur, being one of the most abundant elements globally, has shown promise in mercury adsorption in previous research. This study delves into the influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer.

         <title>Identification of Peptide Binding Motifs for Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate using Phage Display</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration of bassanite (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) into gypsum (the dihydrate) is a fundamental reaction underlying the working principle of conventional plasters. To achieve selective control over this process, peptide structures showing strong interactions with the mineral surfaces were rationally identified by means of phage display. The results highlight the potential of this biophysical technique in the design of new crystallization additives for sustainable construction solutions.







Abstract
Selective control over crystallization in complex multicomponent systems such as hydrating cements is a key issue in modern material science. In this context, rational selection&#8208;based approaches appear highly promising in the quest for new additive chemistries. Here we have used phage display to identify peptide structures showing high affinity to adsorb on the surfaces of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (also referred to as bassanite), an important hydraulic binder employed in large scales by the construction industry. The results suggest a triplet of amino acids consisting of aspartic acid, serine and leucine, to maintain strong interactions with the surfaces of hemihydrate particles. This notion is confirmed by actual hydration experiments, in which the identified peptide motif provides strictly selective effects during the transformation of bassanite into more stable gypsum. Our work thus contributes to a better understanding of hydraulic binders and their required improvement for a sustainable future.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Free Amination and Hydrodefluorination of Aryl Fluorides Promoted by Solvated Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a transition metal&#8208;free method for C&#8722;N coupling of aryl fluorides using solvated electrons, red light, and sonication. The method exhibits moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (35&#8211;99&#8201;%), broad substrate compatibility, and eliminates toxic catalysts.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;N bonds represent a pivotal advancement in chemical science. Traditional methodologies, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, have limitations concerning aryl scope, reliance on toxic and costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and issues related to atom economy and waste generation from ligands and additives. In this work, we introduce a novel method for aminating neutral, electron&#8208;rich, and electron&#8208;deficient aryl halides, eliminating the need for transition metals. Our approach involves the activation of aryl halides using solvated electrons generated from granulated lithium and sonication. This serves as a sustainable source of reducing power, facilitating the efficient formation of C&#8722;N bonds under near ambient conditions. Competitive selectivity studies between halide and ester functionalities were explored. Reaction scope and conducted mechanistic studies which supported the proposed radical&#8208;nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) mechanism for the reaction. Notably, the developed reaction has a highly competitive reductive dehalogenation pathway during the C&#8722;N coupling reaction, and this mechanistic divergency was thoroughly explored. This work not only broadens the scope of C&#8722;N coupling reactions which typically employs aryl bromides and iodides and rarely aryl fluorides which is also equally abundant, but also introduces a new way to do C&#8722;N coupling reactions using solvated electrons.

         <title>Preparation, Structure, Reactivity, Lewis Acidic and Fluorescence Properties of Arylpyridine Based Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates Featuring Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydride elimination from arylpyridyl&#8208;boranes results in formation of cationic highly Lewis acidic species. Nature of counterion appears to be crucial for its reactivity but also to its photophysical behavior. By taking advantage of accessibility diverse aryl pyridines and also by hydroboration reactivity of product, we prepared highly emissive compounds exhibiting green&#8208;yellow fluorescence with reaching quantum yields up to 93&#8201;% have been reported.







Abstract
Herein, we present the preparation of a series of electronically and/or sterically distinct borenium&#8208;type species based on a simple 2&#8208;arylpyridine scaffold. Corresponding arylpyridine was firstly subjected to electrophilic borylation (BBr3/i&#8208;Pr2NEt) and formed BBr2 chelate was reduced with LiAlH4 to yield arylpyridine boron dihydride. Elimination of one hydride led to Lewis acidic borenium&#8208;like products. Four methods of hydride elimination were evaluated and influence of counterions on reactivity, Lewis acidic and luminescent properties was assessed both experimentally and computationally. Arylpyridine chelates featuring weakly coordinating counterions exhibit fluorescent properties upon UV irradiation. Several general trends were inferred to modulate emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yield. Based on our observations, we have devised and prepared borenium&#8208;type fluorophores with yellow&#8208;green fluorescence and quantum yields up to 93&#8201;%.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Centered Oligoynes Capped by Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes and Their Thin&#8208;Film Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes capped by boron difluoride formazanate dyes exhibit solution processability, redox activity, panchromatic absorption, and thin film conductivity. Compared to their metal&#8208;free analogs, Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes have poorer conductivity on the microscale and improved conductivity on the nanoscale.







Abstract
Since the Nobel prize winning discovery that polyacetylene could act as a semiconductor, there has been tremendous efforts dedicated to understanding and harnessing the unusual properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Much of this research has focused on the preparation of oligoynes and polyynes with well&#8208;defined numbers of repeating alkyne units as models for carbyne. These studies are usually hampered by a structure&#8208;property relationship where the stability of the resulting materials decrease with the incorporation of additional alkyne units. Here, we describe a series of oligoynes, with up to 12 alkyne units, where electron&#8208;rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are incorporated at the center of the oligoyne backbones which are capped by electron&#8208;poor BF2 formazanate dyes. These compounds exhibit excellent stability and solubility, panchromatic absorption, and redox activity characteristic of their structural components. These traits facilitated thin&#8208;film studies of extended oligoyne materials, where it is shown that incorporating [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units leads to smoother films, decreased conductivity on the microscale, and increased conductivity on the nanoscale when compared to metal&#8208;free analogs. Remarkably, our oligoynes have superior conductivity compared to the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) semiconductor.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity in Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Aniline&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations into the reactions between Ru(II) and N,N&#8208;disubstituted aniline&#8208;functionalized alkynes revealed that reaction temperature, substrates, and solvent polarity can manipulate the chemoselectivity of cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines for C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indoles.







Abstract
The cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes induced by d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers has traditionally been associated with the vinylidene pathway. However, recent evidence suggests that d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers can also activate alkynes through non&#8208;vinylidene pathways. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation into the reactions between the Ru(II) complex [Ru([9]aneS3)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ and 2&#8208;alkynylanilines. Our study revealed that the selectivity between the vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways can be tuned by reaction temperature, substrate, and solvent polarity. This strategic control allows for the preferential formation of either C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indole zwitterion complexes. Additionally, we identified a rare decyclization mechanism that enables the conversion of C2&#8208;metalated indoles to C3&#8208;metalated indoles, underscoring the significance of product stability in these pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates practical approaches to control the preference between vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways, which is crucial for the design of new catalysts and metalated heterocyclic complexes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Effect of Sodium Iodide on Copper&#8208;Mediated Iododeboronation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation examined differences in the mechanism and side reactions of Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam (CEL) iodination under conditions relevant to radiosynthesis and typical organic synthesis. The concentrations and ratio of iodide and copper were crucial for successfully performing the reaction and understanding the mechanism. The unique conditions relevant to radiosynthesis enable efficient CEL iodination.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam (CEL) coupling reaction advances carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling and has facilitated the development of radiohalogenation methodologies in radiochemistry. This study investigated the mechanisms and side reactions of CEL iodination under conditions relevant to radiosynthesis and typical organic synthesis, focusing on the effects of sodium iodide. The concentrations of copper and iodide, as well as the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio, were identified as significant factors for successful copper&#8208;mediated CEL iodination, influencing the reaction mechanisms and side reactions. Excess iodide relative to the copper salt led to the formation of poorly soluble iodinated copper(I) complexes that competed with that of the desired aryl iodide. Additionally, the predominant copper complex involved in the catalytic cycle differed between the early and late stages of the reaction, depending on the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio. The results of this study indicate that the specialized radiosynthesis conditions meet the requirements for efficient CEL iodination. In particular, an extremely low concentration of iodide is optimal for CEL iodination. These in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights not only provide a detailed comparison of CEL iodination across radiochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry but can also inspire the development of novel (radio)iodination methods.

         <title>Orthogonal Phase Transfer of Oppositely Charged FeII4L6 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rare example of phase transfer of an anionic coordination cage, and investigate the phase transfer behaviour of a mixture of two FeII4L6 cages with the same size and geometry, but with opposite charges. These results represent unprecedented control over the movement of coordination cages between different physical compartments and are anticipated to inform the development of next&#8208;generation supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Coordination cages and their encapsulated cargo can be manoeuvred between immiscible liquid layers in a process referred to as phase transfer. Among the stimuli reported to drive phase transfer, counterion exchange is the most widespread. This method exploits the principle that counterions contribute strongly to the solubility preferences of coordination cages, and involves exchanging hydrophilic and hydrophobic counterions. Nevertheless, phase transfer of anionic cages remains relatively unexplored, as does selective phase transfer of individual cages from mixtures. Here we compare the phase transfer behaviour of two FeII4L6 cages with the same size and geometry, but with opposite charges. As such, this study presents a rare example wherein an anionic cage undergoes phase transfer upon countercation exchange. We then combine these two cages, and demonstrate that their quantitative separation can be achieved by inducing selective phase transfer of either cage. These results represent unprecedented control over the movement of coordination cages between different physical compartments and are anticipated to inform the development of next&#8208;generation supramolecular systems.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Polymerized Solid/Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization can achieve good interfacial contact between polymer electrolytes and electrodes, which can significantly reduce the interfacial resistance. This review summarized the latest in&#8197;situ polymerization strategies of polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries, including thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and concluded the major challenges and future trends of in&#8208;situ polymerized electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
In pursuit of high energy density, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are undoubtedly the best choice. However, leakage and inevitable dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes seriously hinder its practical application. Solid/quasi&#8208;solid state electrolytes have emerged as an answer to solve the above issues. Especially, polymer electrolytes with excellent interface compatibility, high flexibility, and ease of machining have become a research hotspot for LMBs. Nevertheless, the interface contact between polymer electrolyte and inorganic electrode materials and the low ionic conductivity restrict its development. On account of these, in&#8197;situ polymerized polymer electrolyte is proposed. Polymer solid electrolytes produced through in&#8197;situ polymerization promote robust interface contact between the electrolyte and electrode while simplifying the preparation steps. This review summarized the latest research progress in in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. These electrolytes were divided into three parts according to their polymerization methods: thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and so on. Furthermore, we concluded the major challenges and future trends of in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. It's hoped that this review will provide meaningful guidance on designing high&#8208;performance polymer solid electrolytes for LMBs.

Polymer solid electrolytes produced through in&#8197;situ polymerization promote robust interface contact between the electrolyte and electrode while simplifying the preparation steps. This review summarized the latest research progress in in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. These electrolytes were divided into three parts according to their polymerization methods: thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization, and so on. Furthermore, we concluded the major challenges and future trends of in&#8197;situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. It's hoped that this review will provide meaningful guidance on designing high-performance polymer solid electrolytes for LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Encapsulated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of Pd(II)&#8208;encapsulated covalent organic framework (COF) composites has been developed via a versatile microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ encapsulation strategy. Unlike the traditional multi&#8208;step synthesis, this approach establishes a succinct, expeditious, generalizable, and scalable route to access various Pd(II)/COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;encapsulated covalent organic frameworks (metal/COFs) represent an emerging paradigm in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the time&#8208;intensive (usually 4 or more days) and tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis of metal/COFs remains a significant stumbling block for their broad application. To address this challenge, we introduce a facile microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ metal encapsulation strategy to cooperatively combine COF formation and in&#8197;situ palladium(II) encapsulation in one step. With this unprecedented approach, we synthesize a diverse range of palladium(II)&#8208;encapsulated COFs (termed Mw&#8208;Pd/COF) in the air within just an hour. Notably, this strategy is scalable for large&#8208;scale production (~0.5&#8197;g). Leveraging the high crystallinity, porosity, and structural stability, one representative Mw&#8208;Pd/COF exhibits remarkable activity, functional group tolerance, and recyclability for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, surpassing most previously reported Pd(II)/COF catalysts with respect to catalytic performance, preparation time, and synthetic ease. This microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ metal encapsulation strategy opens a facile and rapid avenue to construct metal/COF hybrids, which hold enormous potential in a multitude of applications including heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.

         <title>Mechanochemical Transformations of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: Polymorphs and Coformer Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review article presents the current state of knowledge in the field of solid state mechanochemical studies of binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical industry and materials science.







Abstract
Transformations of solid samples under solvent&#8208;free or minimal solvent conditions set the future trend and define a modern strategy for the production of new materials. Of the various technologies tested in recent years, the mechanochemical approach seems to be the most promising for economic and ecological reasons. The aim of this review article is to present the current state of art in solid state research on binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical and materials science industries. This article is divided into three sections. In the first part, we describe the new equipment improvements, which include the innovative application of thermo&#8208;mechanochemistry, sono&#8208;mechanochemistry, photo&#8208;mechanochemistry, electro&#8208;mechanochemistry, as well as resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), and transformation under high&#8208;speed sample spinning (&#8220;SpeedMixing&#8221;). A brief description of techniques dedicated to ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ studies of progress and the mechanism of solid matter transformation (PXRD, FTIR, Raman and NMR spectroscopy) is presented. In the second section, we discuss the problem of cocrystal polymorphism highlighting the issue related with correlation between mechanochemical parameters (time, temperature, energy, molar ratio, solvent used as a liquid assistant, surface energy, crystal size, crystal shape) and preference for the formation of requested polymorph. The last part is devoted to the description of the processes of coformer exchange in binary systems forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The influence of the thermodynamic factor on the selection of the best&#8208;suited partner for the formation of a two&#8208;component stable structure is presented.

         <title>Surface Modification of Gold Nanorods: Multifunctional Strategies and Application Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synthesis methods and surface ligand modifications of gold nanorods. It explores the roles and advantages of various ligands in self&#8208;assembly, highlighting that the careful selection of appropriate ligands not only optimizes the properties of nanoparticles but also enhances their functionality for specific applications.







Abstract
Gold nanorods (AuNRs), as an important type of gold nanomaterials, have attracted much attention in the nano field. Compared with gold nanoparticls, AuNRs have broader application potential due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonance properties and anisotropic shapes. Yet, conventional synthesis methods using surfactants have limited the use of AuNRs in a variety of fields such as biomedical applications, plasma&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, optics and optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem and improve the stability and biocompatibility of AuNRs, researchers in recent years have used surface modification and functionalization to modify AuNRs, among which the introduction of organic ligands to prepare organic/gold hybrid nanorods has become an effective strategy. Organic materials have better toughness and easy processing, and by introducing organic ligands into the surface of AuNRs, the molecular&#8208;level composite of organic and inorganic materials can be realized, thus obtaining hybrid nanorods with excellent properties. This paper reviews the research progress of hybrid nanocomposites, and introducing the synthesis methods of AuNRs and the development of surface ligand modification, then summarises the applications of a wide variety of ligands. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of different ligands and their roles in further self&#8208;assembly processes are discussed.

         <title>Conformational Switching of a Nano&#8208;Size Urea&#8208;Bridged Zn(II)Porphyrin Dimer by External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explicit stabilization of the (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli viz. solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;mediated stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have wide applicability.







Abstract
For the first time, explicit stabilization of all the three conformers, viz. (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans), of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli such as solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;induced stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have vast potential applicability. X&#8208;ray structural characterizations have been reported for the (cis,cis) and (cis,trans)&#8208;conformers. While (cis,cis) conformer stabilized exclusively in dichloromethane, more polar solvents resulted in the stabilization of (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers. Low temperature promotes the stabilization of (cis,trans)&#8208;conformer while rise in temperature facilitates flipping to the (cis,cis) one. Significantly, exclusive stabilization of the (trans,trans)&#8208;isomer has been illustrated using acetate anion which facilitates H&#8208;bonding with the two amide linkages of the urea spacer. Remarkably, HOPG surface facilitates stabilization of the energetically challenging (trans,trans)&#8208;conformer via CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with the solid surface to the porphyrinic cores. DFT calculations demonstrate that the relative stability of the conformers can be modulated upon slight external perturbations as also observed in the experiment. Several factors contributing towards the conformational landscape for the highly flexible urea&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been mapped.

         <title>Electrodeposition and Optimisation of Amorphous NixSy Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the optimisation of nickel sulfide&#8208;based catalyst prepared via electrodeposition process. Thiourea concentration and current density for deposition are the most influential factors. The optimised NixSy catalyst shows excellent performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser, achieving 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.88&#8197;V under 333&#8197;K in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysers have shown their potential in green hydrogen production. One of the crucial tasks is to discover novel cost&#8208;effective and sustainable electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a low&#8208;cost Ni&#8722;S&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the NixSy catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1&#8197;M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41&#8197;mV, 111&#8197;mV and 202&#8197;mV at 10, 100 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 67.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 recorded at 333&#8197;K. Long&#8208;term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24&#8197;h period on microelectrode at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 71&#8197;mV and 37&#8197;mV overpotential increase at 293&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised NixSy as cathode and NiFe(OH)2 as anode showed 1.88&#8197;V after 1&#8197;h electrolysis at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH under 333&#8197;K with FAA&#8208;3&#8208;30 membrane.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Continuous&#8208;Flow Aminolysis of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminolysis of epoxides is a promising way to construct C&#8722;N bonds without producing any byproduct. In this article, it was revealed that titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide as a solid acid catalyst could accelerate the reaction, and be applied for continuous&#8208;flow systems with high efficiency. Furthermore, sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of an important API, Rivaroxaban intermediate was achieved utilizing hydrogenation and aminolysis to afford the desired product in 73&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report a solid&#8208;acid catalyzed aminolysis of epoxides under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. A titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide catalyst demonstrated exceptional substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields with high catalyst durability. Characterization of the catalyst revealed the crucial role of the titania&#8208;zirconia ratio in optimizing its performance. Furthermore, this method was applied to the efficient, sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of a rivaroxaban intermediate (an oral anticoagulant and the first direct factor Xa inhibitor), combining a hydrogenation step with the aminolysis reaction without the need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>Tetrazaisoindigos:Serpentine Syntheses and Their Expected and Unexpected Photophysical and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positions of nitrogen atoms have a great impact on the stabilities, photophysical and electric properties of tetrazaisoindigos.







Abstract
Isoindigo, an electron&#8208;withdrawing building block for polymeric field&#8208;effect transistors, has long been considered to be non&#8208;fluorescent. Moreover, using electron&#8208;deficient heterocycle to replace the phenyl ring in the isoindigo core for better electron transport behaviour is synthetically challenging. Here we report the syntheses of a series of tetrazaisoindigos, including pyrazinoisoindigo (PyrII), pyrimidoisoindigo (PymII) and their hybrid (PyrPymII), and the investigation on their photophysical and electric properties. Proper flanking groups need to be chosen to stabilize these highly electron&#8208;deficient bislactams. Both PyrII and PymII derivatives show lower LUMO energy levels than that of naphthalene bisimide (NDI). Interestingly, PyrII is instinctively unstable and can be easily reduced, while both PymII derivatives are stable. More surprisingly, PymII derivatives are highly fluorescent and their photoluminescence quantum yields are around 40&#8201;%, 133 times higher than that of reported isoindigo derivatives. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic results and theoretical calculations show that strong intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond exists in PymII, which prohibits it from non&#8208;radiative decay and accounts for its fluorescent behaviour. PymII derivatives are n&#8208;type semiconductors, while Ph&#8208;PyrII and the hybrid show balanced ambipolar charge transport behaviour, all among the best isoindigo derivatives. Our study not only discloses the structure&#8208;property relationship of tetrazaisoindigos, but also provides novel electron&#8208;deficient monomers for conjugated polymers.

         <title>Controlling the Helical Pitch of Foldamers through Terminal Functionality: A Solid State Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographic study into the influence of varying the terminal functionality on the helical pitch of a series of foldamers is reported. Herein, we show that through systematic modification of the terminal functionality in the foldamer, from carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylamide (N(Ph)2), ferrocene to tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) helical pitches between 3.4&#8211;7.3&#8197;&#197; can be readily accessed in these supramolecular scaffolds.







Abstract
Developing new methods to control the size and shape of the helical structures adopted by foldamers is highly important as the secondary structure displayed by these supramolecular scaffolds often dictates their activity and function. Herein, we report on a systematic study demonstrating that the helical pitch of ortho&#8208;azobenzene/2,6&#8208;pyridyldicarboxamide foldamers can be readily controlled through the nature of the terminal functionality. Remarkably, simply through varying the end group of the foldamer, and without modifying any other structural features of the scaffold, the helical pitch can be over doubled in magnitude (from 3.4&#8197;&#197;&#8211;7.3&#8197;&#197;). Additionally, crystallographic analysis of a library ten foldamers has identified general trends in the influence of a range of terminal functionalities, including carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylcarbamyl (N(Ph)2), ferrocene (Fc) and tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), in controlling the folding behaviour of these supramolecular scaffolds. These studies could prove useful in the future development of functional foldamers which adopt specific sizes and shapes.

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective peptide&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reaction to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates featuring unusually short reaction times (15&#8211;60&#8197;min) at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) was developed. Key to high reactivity is the reluctance of the peptide catalyst to undergo deactivation by alkylation and, at first glance counterintuitive, a high steric demand of the ester group of the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate.







Abstract
The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H&#8208;Mep&#8208;dPro&#8208;dGlu&#8208;NH2, which is reluctant to undergo alkylation, catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60&#8197;min) to yield a broad range of &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.

&lt;p&gt;The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;-nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;-ester-&#947;-nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine-based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H-Mep-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;Pro-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;Glu-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is reluctant to undergo alkylation, catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60&#8197;min) to yield a broad range of &#946;-ester-&#947;-nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;-nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Reactivity of an Aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 Ligand via Electrophilic Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic activation of an aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand drastically enhances its reactivity, opening new synthetic avenues in phosphorus chemistry. It allows for the selective functionalization at the 2&#8208;position of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand and leads to the yet unaccomplished contraction to a catena&#8208;P4 moiety. In contrast, when E1 (E=N, P) surrogates are used, aggregation of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand could be achieved, affording unprecedented P10&#8208; and P11&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
Electrophilic activation of the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] is demonstrated to drastically enhance its reactivity towards weak nucleophiles. Unprecedented functionalized, contracted as well as complexly aggregated polyphosphorus compounds are accessed utilizing [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A), highlighting the great potential of this underexplored mode of reactivity. Addition of carbenes to A affords novel 1,2&#8208; or 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized cyclo&#8208;P5 complexes [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;L)(2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (L=IDipp (1), EtCAAC (2), IiPr (3&#8201;b)) and [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IiPr)(1&#8208;Me)][OTf] (3&#8201;a). For the first time, the much smaller IMe4 leads to the contraction of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand and formation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P4(1&#8208;IMe)(4&#8208;Me)] (4). DFT calculations shed light on the delicate mechanism of this type of reaction, which is reinforced by the experimental identification of key intermediates. Even the comparably weak nucleophile IDippCH2 reacts with A to form [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IDippCH2)(1/2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (6&#8201;a/b), highlighting its explicitly more reactive nature. Moreover, exposure of A to IDippEH (E=N, P) leads to a unique aggregation reaction affording [{Cp*Fe}2{&#956;2,&#951;4:3:1&#8211;P10Me2(IDippN)}][OTf] (8) and [{Cp*Fe}2{&#956;2,&#951;4:1:1:1&#8211;P11Me2(IDipp)}][OTf] (9), respectively.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we devised a direct arylation reactions of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with azonaphthalenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as the catalyst. This method delivers structurally novel atroposelective N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;azole heteroaryl diamines with high yields (up to &gt;98&#8201;%) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios while exhibiting a wide range of substrate compatibility.

         <title>Targeted Photoactivatable Green&#8208;Emitting BODIPY Based on Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Activation and its Application to Live Dynamic Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PFB is an efficient, green&#8208;emitting, photoactivatable probe based on BODIPY. Upon irradiation with visible light (488&#8197;nm), directed photooxidation oxidizes the furanyl group and eliminates the quenching TICT mechanism, resulting in an impressive fluorescence enhancement at 510&#8197;nm (93&#8208;fold increase). PFB has been targeted to various cellular organelles and successfully used in photoactivation and live dynamic super&#8208;resolution microscopy.







Abstract
Photoactivatable fluorescent probes are valuable tools in bioimaging for tracking cells down to single molecules and for single molecule localization microscopy. For the latter application, green emitting dyes are in demand. We herein developed an efficient green&#8208;emitting photoactivatable furanyl&#8208;BODIPY (PFB) and we established a new mechanism of photoactivation called Directed Photooxidation Induced Activation (DPIA) where the furan is photo&#8208;oxidized in a directed manner by the singlet oxygen produced by the probe. The efficient photoconverter (93&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 510&#8197;nm, 49&#8201;% yield conversion) is functionalizable and allowed targeting of several subcellular structures and organelles, which were photoactivated in live cells. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of PFB in super&#8208;resolution imaging by performing PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in live cells.

         <title>200 Years of The Haloform Reaction: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Known for over 200&#8197;years, the haloform reaction is one of the oldest organic reactions, enabling the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters or amides from methyl ketones via exhaustive halogenation. The reaction has not been extensively reviewed since 1934. Herein, we provide an overview of the history and mechanism of the reaction, methodology developments and a survey of applications, particularly in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Discovered in 1822, the haloform reaction is one of the oldest synthetic organic reactions. The haloform reaction enables the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters or amides from methyl ketones. The reaction proceeds via exhaustive &#945;&#8208;halogenation and then substitution by a nucleophile to liberate a haloform. The methyl group therefore behaves as a masked leaving group. The reaction methodology has undergone several important developments in the last 200&#8197;years, transitioning from a diagnostic test of methyl ketones to a synthetically useful tool for accessing complex esters and amides. The success of the general approach has been exhibited through the use of the reaction in the synthesis of many different complex molecules in fields ranging from natural product synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrants and flavourings. The reaction has not been extensively reviewed since 1934. Therefore, herein we provide details of the history and mechanism of the haloform reaction, as well as an overview of the developments in the methodology and a survey of examples, particularly in natural product synthesis, in which the haloform reaction has been used.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams via Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Kinugasa/Aldol or Kinugasa/Mannich Cascade Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds are the prevalent structural units in antibiotics and natural products. Herein, three&#8208;component asymmetric Kinugasa/aldol and Kinugasa/Mannich cascade reactions have been developed for constructing &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. This strategy enables sequential assembly of alkynes, nitrones and aldehydes (or imines) and creates three contiguous stereogenic centers, controlled by copper(I) catalysts and chiral bis(oxazolidine) ligands. The developed protocol features high enantioselectivity, good reaction efficiency, and mild operational conditions representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the construction of functionalized chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense&#160;and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.</dc:description>

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms &#8211; Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described yet. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5 eV. A comparison of the band structures with the related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn27&#8208;x&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons to form a semiconductor.&#160;Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 is a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8208;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilized with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8211;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel based on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Seeing double: the persistent dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure of drug resistant influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8208;60 or 18&#8208;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Distance&#8208;dependent symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Interfacial Molecular Interactions on Ag Hollow Fibre Gas Diffusion Electrodes for High Efficiency in CO2 Conversion to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silver hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) acts as a CO2 diffuser through the porous wall, effectively converting CO2 to CO in a wide potential range. CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface of the flow&#8208;through Ag&#8208;based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple&#8208;phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long&#8208;alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB&#8208;containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Silica Film with a TGBA* Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally colored organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure are prepared using a thermochromic liquid crystal mixture. The structural color is sensitive to the polymerization temperature and the chiral additive concentration. A colorful OIHS pattern is prepared by the inject printing, which can be applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Twisted grain boundary (TGB) phases exhibit highly frustrated and complex liquid crystal structures, and have attracted enormous interest because of their unique internal structure, textures and properties. However, among the few real concerns related to these interesting structures, applying them to prepare polymer&#8208;stabilized colored liquid crystal films has been challenging. Herein, the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure were prepared using two organosilanes and one chiral additive under an acidic condition. The structural color of the films can be adjusted by varying the polycondensation temperature and the concentration of the chiral additive. A structurally colored pattern was prepared by the inject printing, which was suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzodihydrofurans Bearing Axial and Central Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of &#945; &#8208;chloronitrostyrenes and a chiral squaramide catalyst, C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N pro&#8208;axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthol substrates, featuring low barriers to enantiomerization, underwent a remote diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective domino Michael/O&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Facile Preparation and Study of Self&#8208;Healing Water&#8208;Absorbing Expanding Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work to different environments of the three main means of self&#8208;heal in addition to the other two replication of the repair of the three cyclic alternation to cope with the alternation of different environments, the combination of fillers for the elastomer to provide water&#8208;absorbing expansion effect and electrical sensors to detect the function of the construction of a multi&#8208;environmental self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion of elastomers







Abstract
The absorbent expansion elastomer plays a crucial role in engineering sealing and holds a promising future in this field as infrastructure continues to develop. Traditional materials have their limitations, especially when used in large construction projects where the integrity and reliability of the material are of utmost importance. In this work, a self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion elastomer was developed for continuous production at a large scale to monitor the sealing conditions of massive infrastructure projects. At room temperature, the material exhibited a repairing efficiency of 57.77&#8201;% within 2&#8197;h, which increased to 84.02&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h. This extended reaction time allowed for effective repairs when defects were detected. The material's strength can attain 3&#8197;MPa, placing it at the upper echelon among common self&#8208;healing materials, thereby granting it a certain level of durability in its application environment. The material's volume expansion rate reached 200&#8211;400&#8201;% to achieve effective sealing, and the functional filling of the filler endowed the material itself with a favorable external force induction effect and prevented heat accumulation. The conductive detection performance of the absorbent expansion elastomer was improved by utilizing triple self&#8208;healing strategies, including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, ion cross&#8208;linked network, and externally&#8208;aided restoration materials. These strategies were combined with a double packing strategy to enhance the material's properties. This innovative elastomer can be applied in various fields such as tunnel construction, infrastructure development, aerospace sealing, and railway transportation, showcasing significant potential for diverse engineering applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Positron&#8208;bonded Dihalides: Ps2XY (X, Y=F, Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic stability of Ps2XY complexes is confirmed through potential energy curves, and positron/electron densities reveal the presence of two&#8208;positron bonds. Ps2XY systems typically show shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies than the PsXY&#8722; ones. The analogy between Ps2XY systems and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A, B=Na, K, Rb) is also explored.







Abstract
This study explores the energetic stability and physical properties of

 complexes formed by two halide anions (X&#8722;, Y&#8722;=F&#8722;, X&#8722;, Br&#8722;), and two positrons (Ps: positron&#8208;electron pair). We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial third&#8208;order propagator (MC&#8208;REN&#8208;PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two&#8208;positron bonds. The global stability of the

 complexes contrasts with the metastable two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded (PsH)2, which energetically favors the emission of Ps2. Comparative analysis of one&#8208; and two&#8208;positron dihalides indicates that the addition of a positron to PsXY&#8722; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of PsXY&#8722; and Y&#8722;.

 and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A, B=Na, K, Rb). The bonding properties in two&#8208;positron dihalides and their electronic dialkali analogs are comparable, displaying identical periodic trends. However, compared to their isoelectronic AB counterparts, the positron bonds in

         <title>Biocompatible Flash Chemiluminescent Assay Enabled by Sterically Hindered Spiro&#8208;Strained&#8208;Oxetanyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dioxetane</title>

         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects yield a chemically stable strained dioxetane with flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. Probes composed of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane show enhanced stability and sensitivity in bacterial and mammalian assays over cyclobutyl&#8208;fused probes.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence is the emission of light that occurs as a result of a chemical reaction. Depending on the rate of chemiexcitation, light emission can occur as a long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;intensity, glow&#8208;type reaction or a rapid, highly intense flash&#8208;type reaction. Assays using a flash&#8208;type mode of action provide enhanced detection sensitivity compared to those using a glow&#8208;type mode. Recently, our group discovered that applying spiro&#8208;strain to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes significantly increases their chemiexcitation rate, thereby transforming glow&#8208;type chemiluminescence into flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. However, further examination of the structure&#8208;activity relationships revealed that the spiro&#8208;strain severely compromises the chemical stability of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. We hypothesized that a combination of spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and an electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, will result in a chemically stable spiro&#8208;strained dioxetane with an accelerated chemiexcitation rate. Indeed, spiro&#8208;fused tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl exhibited a 128&#8208;fold faster chemiexcitation rate compared to adamantyl while maintaining similar chemical stability, with a half&#8208;life of over 400&#8197;hours in PBS 7.4 buffer at room temperature. Turn&#8208;on probes composed of tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane exhibited significantly improved chemical stability in bacterial and mammalian cell media compared to previously developed dioxetane probes fused to a cyclobutyl unit. The superior chemical stability enables a tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane probe to detect &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activity with enhanced sensitivity in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial assays and leucine aminopeptidase activity in tumoral cell lines. Overall, the development of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane luminophore enables us to enhance the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescent probes while maintaining high chemical stability. The results obtained in this study should assist in designing improved chemiluminescent probes and underscore the significance of strain&#8208;release techniques in enhancing the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescence assays.

         <title>The Divergent Reactivity of Acid Chlorides Under Transition Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid chlorides represent a highly reactive and versatile class of electrophiles widely used in synthesis as acylating agents. However, when combined with transition metal catalysis, new reactivity paradigms have been uncovered. This review examines the palladium, rhodium, and iridium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of acid chlorides with unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds and discusses future research directions.







Abstract
The power and ability of catalysis to build multiple C&#8722;C bonds in a single step has had a transformative impact on organic synthesis. While the reactivity of organohalides with metal catalysts is widely appreciated, the related and more intricate reactivity of acid chlorides is less so, despite their use as common reagents in synthesis. Here, we review the transformations of acid chlorides in combination with unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds catalyzed by palladium, rhodium, or iridium and provide an outlook for future research opportunities.

         <title>D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type [7]Helicene&#8208;like Imide Derivatives with Tunable Photophysical Properties and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical emitters are developed by integrating [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor (A) with five donors (D). These emitters show tunable emission colors from blue to orange and enhanced &#934;FL. Two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit significant CPL activities. This molecular engineering offers a viable strategy for enhancing the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives.







Abstract
Helicenes and their derivatives show great application prospects as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, but their fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FLs) need a breakthrough urgently. Herein, we reported a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical luminescent emitters by combining the [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor with five different donors. The obtained five emitters display blue&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence and markedly enhanced &#934;FL. Notably, TPA&#8208;NiBTI exhibits the maximum &#934;FL in solution, while TPE&#8208;NiBTI achieves a maximum &#934;FL in the solid state. Their two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit remarkable CPL activities, and their doped PS film both displayed doubled &#934;FLs. Among them, [(P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI]&#8208;doped PS film exhibits the maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) value of 9.0&#215;10&#8722;4 and the maximum &#934;FL of 22&#8201;%. This molecular design strategy presents a promising approach to improving the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives, thereby facilitating their potential application into chiral optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Halogen Impact on the Supramolecular Organization of Chiral Phthalimide Emitters Displaying Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogens can play a crucial role on room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of organic compounds, notably because of the well&#8208;known internal heavy atom effect. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond this commonly considered aspect, the presence of a halogen atom plays a critical role in influencing the packing between chromophores at the supramolecular level, which can significantly impact the resulting efficiency and lifetimes of the RTP process.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.

         <title>Preparation of Large Perphenylbiaryls: Can Intermolecular Coupling Compete with Intramolecular Cyclization of Precursors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to prepare perphenylbiaryls containing heptaphenylnaphthyl groups via Ullmann coupling or Diels&#8208;Alder reactions led predominantly to unusual intramolecular cyclization products derived from the naphthalene precursors. Ullmann coupling of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene gave only 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene, and Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene and tetracyclone gave the illustrated mixture of inter&#8208; and intramolecular cyclization products.







Abstract
The highly substituted naphthalenes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (13), 2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (12), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (4), and 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (5) were prepared by a variety of methods, and all but 5 were crystallographically characterized. The attempted Ullmann coupling of 4 to give tetradecaphenyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (3), at both 270&#8201;&#176;C and 350&#8201;&#176;C, yielded instead 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene (17) via an intramolecular cyclization reaction. When the alkyne 5 was heated with tetracyclone (6) at 350&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8208;(pentaphenylphenyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (7) was formed in 3&#8201;% yield. However, greater amounts of 5,6,7,8,9,14&#8208;hexaphenyldibenzo[a,e]pyrene (20, 11&#8201;%) and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylfluoranthene (21, 11&#8201;%) were produced, the former by intramolecular cyclization and dehydrogenation of 5 and the latter by an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 5 followed by extrusion of acetylene. The X&#8208;ray structure of 7 shows it to be an exceptionally crowded biaryl, and the X&#8208;ray structure of 20 shows it to be a saddle shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

         <title>Synergistic Nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co Heterojunctions for Boosting the Selectivity in Hydrogenation of Nitrostyrenes and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosed herein the graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for low&#8208;pressure hydrogenation (&lt;5&#8197;bar), proficiently converting nitro groups to amines amid reactive functional groups like C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. High selectivity and yield arise from the synergistic interaction between CoO and Mn3O4, facilitated by charge relocalization crucial for maintaining selectivity, a feature notably compromised in catalysts containing MnO, CoO, Co3O4, and other Co and Mn oxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;metal oxide interface catalysts are in high demand for advanced catalytic applications due to their multi&#8208;component active sites, which facilitate synergistic cooperation where a single component alone cannot effectively promote the desired reaction. Demonstrated herein graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of nitro styrenes/nitro arenes to amino styrenes/arenes under mild reaction conditions (0.5&#8197;MPa and 100&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 THF/water). Charge relocalization at the Co&#8208;CoO&#8208;Mn3O4 heterojunction interfaces, primarily driven by Mn3O4, significantly improves reaction selectivity. Replacing Mn3O4 with MnO or using other supported bimetallic CoMnOx catalysts decreases selectivity, leading to the formation of a mixture of products. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable selectivity in converting nitro groups to amines, even in the presence of highly reactive functional groups such as C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. It also exhibited high yields, multiple reusability, and a broad substrate scope. This study demonstrates how Mn3O4, in synergy with CoO&#8722;Co, fine&#8208;tunes selectivity, paving the way for the development of advanced metal&#8208;metal oxide interface catalysts to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in organic transformations.

         <title>Supramolecular Spin Chains via Radical&#8208;Radical Contacts Stabilizing Ferromagnetic Interactions Between Heisenberg or Ising&#8208;Like Spins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular one&#8208;dimensional arrays of radical&#8208;metal coordination complexes (Ni &amp; Co) exhibit magnetic properties strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the spin carrier. Close contacts between regions of &#945; and &#946; spin density on the pendant paramagnetic ligands suggest a mechanism for the intra&#8208;chain ferromagnetic coupling via the McConnell I model.







Abstract
A new paramagnetic ligand, 4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;furyl)&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;dithiadiazolyl (furylpymDTDA) and three transition metal coordination complexes, M(hfac)2(furylpymDTDA) M=Mn, Co, Ni; hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonato&#8722;), are reported. The solid&#8208;state structures are influenced by the geometry of the coordination sphere of the M(II) centers: trigonal (Mn) vs. octahedral (Co and Ni). While the hs&#8208;Mn(II) complex exhibits pairwise multi&#8208;centre&#8197;2&#8208;electron bonds (i.&#8201;e., pancake bonds) between the planar &#960; radical DTDA moieties, the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes crystallize with close contacts between coordinated furylpymDTDA radical ligands that define linear 1D arrays of molecular units. The magnetic data for the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes indicate ferromagnetic (FM) interactions between molecular units, apparently mediated by radical&#8208;radical contacts along the supramolecular chains. Computational analysis suggests proximity between regions of large &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;spin density on neighbouring molecular sites enabling FM exchange, in accordance with the McConnell I mechanism. The magnetic data for the Ni(II) complex are consistent with a Heisenberg spin chain, whereas the hs&#8208;Co(II) complex exhibits Ising&#8208;like spin chain behaviour and a magnetic phase transition to an FM ordered state at 4.6&#8197;K.

The magnetic data for the Ni(II) complex are consistent with a Heisenberg spin chain, whereas the &lt;i&gt;hs&lt;/i&gt;-Co(II) complex exhibits Ising-like spin chain behaviour and a magnetic phase transition to an FM ordered state at 4.6&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Chemical and Electrochemical Limitations in Sulfide Solid State Electrolytes: A Critical Review on Current Status and Manufacturing Scope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of solid electrolytes (SEs) as a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). It covers SE types, ion transport fundamentals, and manufacturing challenges of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Special focus is given to sulfide SEs, addressing recent advancements, electrochemical challenges, and future directions to enhance battery performance and safety.







Abstract
The escalating demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, driven by the depletion of fossil fuels has stimulated extensive research in advanced battery technologies. Over the past two decades, global primary energy consumption, initially satisfied by non&#8208;renewables, has raised environmental concerns. Despite the availability of renewable sources like solar and wind, storage challenges propel innovation in batteries. Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have gained recognition for their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, issues such as safety concerns, dendrite formation, and limited operational temperatures necessitate alternative solutions. A promising approach involves replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes (SEs). SEs represent a transformative shift in battery technology, offering stability, safety, and expanded temperature ranges. They effectively mitigate dendrite growth, enhancing battery reliability and lifespan. SEs also improve energy density, making them crucial for applications like portable gadgets, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. However, challenges such as ionic conductivity, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical strength, and manufacturability must be addressed. This review paper briefly identifies SE types, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and explores ion transport fundamentals and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) production challenges. It comprehensively analyzes sulfide SEs (SSEs), focusing on recent advancements, chemical and electrochemical challenges, and potential future improvements. Electrochemical reactions, electrolyte materials, compositions, and cell designs are critically assessed for their impact on battery performance. The review also addresses challenges in ASSB production. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of SSEs, laying the groundwork for advancing sustainable and efficient energy storage systems.

         <title>Facile Access to Terminal Nitroalkanes via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydronitration and Hydronitroalkylation of Alkenes Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroalkanes: This work introduces methods to convert alkenes to terminal nitroalkanes using redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide and aromatic thiol as HAT mediator under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Mild conditions tolerate number of functionalities, and the products can be obtained with exceptional anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. In addition to hydronitration, we introduce an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitroalkylation strategy that facilitates chain expansion while maintaining the nitro group at the terminal position.







Abstract
The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value&#8208;added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. By employing the redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide, the produced nitryl radicals, in the presence of an olefin and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediator, lead to an anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition with complete regioselectivity. Furthermore, we present results demonstrating the use of this catalytic system for chain expansion via anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition, utilizing substituted bromonitroalkanes as commercially available reagents. These transformations effectively address a gap in synthetic chemistry, enabling the direct synthesis of nitroalkanes from a variety of unactivated olefins in both complex molecules and unfunctionalized commodity chemicals.

         <title>A New Mechanism for Formation of Glycine from Glyoxylic Acid: the Aza&#8208;Cannizzaro Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyoxylate imine is found to undergo Cannizzaro&#8208;like disproportionation under mild conditions to form glycine. The mechanism by which an iminium&#8208;hemiaminal pair disproportionate into an amide and amine has not been previously reported.







Abstract
Glyoxylic acid and glycine are widely considered to have been important prebiotic building blocks. Several mechanistic routes have been previously examined for conversion of glyoxylic acid to glycine. Here we provide evidence for a new mechanistic path. Glycine is spontaneously formed from glyoxylic acid in ammonium&#8208;rich aqueous solutions at neutral pH; oxamic acid is generated as well. Hydride transfer from the glyoxylate&#8208;derived hemiaminal to the corresponding iminium ion appears to underlie this transformation. This proposed mechanism parallels the well&#8208;known Cannizzaro reaction mechanism, which leads us to suggest the designation &#8220;aza&#8208;Cannizzaro reaction.&#8221; This discovery offers a new perspective on prebiotic nitrogen incorporation because glycine can be a source of nitrogen for more complex molecules, including other &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Resolving the Structure of a Guanine Quadruplex in TMPRSS2 Messenger RNA by Circular Dichroism and Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have determined the structure of a guanine quadruplex motif present in the messenger RNA of the TMPRSS2 protein. By using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and circular diuchroism spectroscopy we confirm a parallel arrangement involving a rigid tetrad core and flexible loops.







Abstract
The presence of a guanine quadruplex in the opening reading frame of the messenger RNA coding for the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) may pave the way to original anticancer and host&#8208;oriented antiviral strategy. Indeed, TMPRSS2 in addition to being overexpressed in different cancer types, is also related to the infection of respiratory viruses, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, by promoting the cellular and viral membrane fusion through its proteolytic activity. The design of selective ligands targeting TMPRSS2 messenger RNA requires a detailed knowledge, at atomic level, of its structure. Therefore, we have used an original experimental&#8208;computational protocol to predict the first resolved structure of the parallel guanine quadruplex secondary structure in the RNA of TMPRSS2, which shows a rigid core flanked by a flexible loop. This represents the first atomic scale structure of the guanine quadruplex structure present in TMPRSS2 messenger RNA.

         <title>Modelling and Numerical Evaluation of Photovoltaic Parameters of a Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cell Based on Methylammonium Tin Iodide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present cell architecture involves a thorough assessment of device physics including electric field distribution, effect of bandgap, effect of absorber thickness, generation and recombination, and band alignment. The model cell boasts a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 36&#8201;%, and has the ability to retain an impressive built&#8208;in potential of 0.58&#8197;eV at relatively high temperature (400&#8197;K).







Abstract
Designing a high&#8208;performance solar cell structure requires the understanding of material innovation, device engineering, charge behavior, operation characteristics and efficient photoconversion of light to generate electricity. This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO3/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS&#8208;1D device simulator, an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3184&#8197;V, short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.10&#8197;mA/cm2, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38&#8201;%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24&#8201;% were achieved. The model cell exhibits a robust photon capture of 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency between 360 and 750&#8197;nm. The study also presents a temperature&#8208;dependent band alignment diagram which posted a built&#8208;in potential (Vbi) of 0.62&#8197;eV. The Vbi at 400&#8197;K was found to be 0.58&#8197;eV indicating that the model cell exhibits a decent temperature tolerance, and can retain approximately 93&#8201;% of its power at 400&#8197;K. Through Mott&#8208;Schottky capacitance analysis, deeper insights into the space&#8208;charge region are inferred, while recombination&#8208;generation investigations emphasize the significance of electronic properties in optimizing device performance. This paper, therefore, lays the foundation for future studies, offering clear pathways for device optimization and identifying key areas that require further investigation.

This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS-1D device simulator, an impressive open-circuit voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.3184&#8197;V, short-circuit current density (J&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 35.10&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38&#8201;%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24&#8201;% were achieved. The model cell exhibits a robust photon capture of 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency between 360 and 750&#8197;nm. The study also presents a temperature-dependent band alignment diagram which posted a built-in potential (V&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.62&#8197;eV. The V&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt; at 400&#8197;K was found to be 0.58&#8197;eV indicating that the model cell exhibits a decent temperature tolerance, and can retain approximately 93&#8201;% of its power at 400&#8197;K. Through Mott-Schottky capacitance analysis, deeper insights into the space-charge region are inferred, while recombination-generation investigations emphasize the significance of electronic properties in optimizing device performance. This paper, therefore, lays the foundation for future studies, offering clear pathways for device optimization and identifying key areas that require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;dependent Metallosupramolecular Polymerization Regulated by Ligand Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit ligand geometry (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped) to tune the self&#8208;assembly pathways (one vs. two&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly), morphology (nanoparticles vs. fibers) and photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited state) of metallosupramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Understanding structure/property correlations in self&#8208;assembly is a key but challenging requirement for developing functional materials. Herein, we explore the importance of ligand geometry to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited states) and self&#8208;assembly pathways in metallosupramolecular polymerization. To this end, we have designed two hydrophobic Pt(II) complexes, 1 and 2, containing a &#960;&#8208;extended bidentate bipyridine ligand with different substitution pattern, resulting in different molecular geometries (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped). Detailed comparative studies revealed significant differences for both complexes in terms of their photophysical properties and self&#8208;assembly pathways in non&#8208;polar media. The V&#8208;shaped topology of 1 enables facile face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking with a certain curvature leading to luminescent spherical assemblies exhibiting MMLCT states and short Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts via a single&#8208;step cooperative pathway. On the other hand, the higher preorganized linear topology of complex 2 induces a two&#8208;step competitive self&#8208;assembly process leading to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers with slipped packing and MLCT&#8208;originated emission. Our findings broaden the monomer scope for supramolecular polymerization and provide design guidelines for the realization of luminescent supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Functionalized Triphenylmethyl Radicals Showing High Stability and Reversible Electrochemical Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of radicals (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) were synthesized and investigated with electrochemical measurements. The partially conjugated connection between the PBI and TTM&#8901; not only keeps inherent characteristics of building blocks but also facilitates electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes and contributes to obtain extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
This study presents a series of triphenylmethyl monoradicals incorporating varying numbers of peripheral perylene bisimide (PBI) substituents (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901; and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing PBI substituents significantly enhances the stability of these carbon radicals, enabling them to display exceptional electrochemical redox reversibility. Notably, the electronic interplay between the PBI substituents and the central triphenylmethyl core facilitates unique and reversible multi&#8208;step redox reactions. Among the reported radicals, the tris&#8208;PBI&#8208;functionalized radical (3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) demonstrates the remarkable ability to accommodate up to seven electrons under negative potentials, forming high valence anions. This research promotes the development of highly stable carbon radicals with superior electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction processes, presenting promising avenues for the advancement of electric energy storage technologies.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis of Luminescent Imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2 was synthesized from ammonothermal synthesis. The structure and presence of the imide groups could be determined in a multi&#8208;step characterization process using X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic methods. These investigations allowed to determine a preferred position of the hydrogen atoms among the possible imide positions. Doped samples show an efficient cyan luminescence under ultraviolet light.







Abstract
The structural variability of a compound class is an important criterion for the research into phosphor host lattices for phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). Especially, nitridophosphates and the related class of imidonitridophosphates are promising candidates. Recently, the ammonothermal approach has opened a systematic access to this substance class with larger sample quantities. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+. Its crystal structure is solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in space group Cc (no. 9) with lattice parameters a=12.5250(3), b=12.5566(4), c=7.3882(2) &#197; and &#946;=102.9793(10)&#176;. For the first time, adamantane&#8208;type (imido)nitridophosphate anions [P4N8(NH)2]8&#8722; are observed next to metal ions other than alkali metals in a compound. The presence of imide groups in the structure and the identification of preferred positions for the hydrogen atoms are performed using a combination of quantum chemical calculations, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Eu2+ doped samples exhibit cyan emission (&#955;max=498&#8197;nm, fwhm=50&#8197;nm/1981&#8197;cm&#8722;1) when excited with ultraviolet light with an impressive internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41&#8201;%, which represents the first benchmark for imidonitridophosphates and is promising for potential industrial application of this compound class.

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels from Nanodiamonds and a Self&#8208;Assembling Tripeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposite hydrogels can be obtained by embedding nanodiamonds (NDs) within the fibrillary network that arises from self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide biomolecule at physiological pH. Spectroscopy and microscopy data point to non&#8208;covalent interactions between peptide fibers and NDs, which enable modulation of the viscoelastic properties of the nanocomposites.







Abstract
We report the successful assembly of a tripeptide in the presence of nanodiamonds (NDs) into nanocomposite hydrogels. While the presence of NDs does not hinder peptide self&#8208;assembly and gelation kinetics are not affected, NDs improve the viscoelastic properties and significantly increase the elastic moduli of the peptide hydrogels. Increased resistance of the gels against applied stress can also be attained depending on the amount of NDs loaded in the nanocomposite. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide&#8208;ND non&#8208;covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near&#8208;infrared responsiveness.

         <title>The Many Facets of RuII(dppe)2 Acetylide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, we provide an overview of the use of RuII alkynyl derivatives toward the understanding and the development of various research domains, ranging from non&#8208;linear and linear optics to nano&#8208;and molecular electronics through molecular switches.







Abstract
In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the &#960; system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light&#8208;harvesting applications or non&#8208;linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/&#960; mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Detection of Guanine Quadruplexes by Raman Optical Activity and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Interpretation of the Spectra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dramatic increase of Raman optical activity of guanosine monophosphate reveals a quadruplex formation. The shapes of the spectra could be reproduced by computations and related to the geometry, in particular to the mutual twist of quadruplex units in the polymer.







Abstract
Quadruplexes formed by guanine derivatives or guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids are involved in metabolism and genetic storage of many living organisms, they are used in DNA nanotechnologies or as biosensors. Since many quadruplex geometries are possible the determination of their structures in aqueous solutions is difficult. Raman optical activity (ROA) can make it easier: For guanosine monophosphate (GMP), we observed a distinct change of the spectra upon its condensation and quadruplex formation. The vibrational bands become more numerous, stronger, and narrower. In particular, a huge ROA signal appears below 200&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The aggregation can be induced by high concentration, low temperature, or by a metal ion. We focused on well&#8208;defined quadruplexes stabilized by potassium, where using molecular dynamics and density functional theory the spectra and particular features related to GMP geometric parameters could be understood. The simulations explain the main experimental trends and confirm that the ROA spectroscopy is sensitive to fine structural details, including guanine base twist in the quadruplex helix.

         <title>N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Derived from the Pyrolysis of a Polydopamine&#8208;coated Hypercross&#8208;linked Polymer for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) while adjusting the mass ratio and carbonisation temperature. The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 was 6.46&#8197;mmol/g and 3.05&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C, 25&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa, respectively.







Abstract
Porous carbon materials can simultaneously capture and convert carbon dioxide, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and using carbon dioxide as a feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals or fuel. In this work, a series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared; the CO2 adsorption capacity of the prepared PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T was enhanced by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) and then adjusting the mass ratio of PDA to HCP and the carbonization temperature. The results showed that the prepared PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity due to abundant micropores (0.6762&#8197;cm3/g), a high specific surface area (1220.8&#8197;m2/g), and moderate surface nitrogen content (2.75&#8201;%). Notably, PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 6.46&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa. Critically, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons can also be used as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with epichlorohydrin to form chloropropylene carbonate, with chloropropylene carbonate yielding up to 64&#8201;% and selectivity of the reaction reaching 94&#8201;%. As a result, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons could serve as potential candidates for CO2 capture and conversion due to their high reactivity, excellent CO2 uptake, and good catalytic performance.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3:2:9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskite based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (D&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4 kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO release and ROS generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3 Br] Ph&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8226;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2 &lt; 1 &#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It&#160;focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750&#8208;2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. The development of organic&#8208;based materials is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility, however, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#183;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#183;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and 3.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo(chloro)silanes are indispensable building blocks in silicon chemistry. Yet, aside from the M&#252;ller&#8208;Rochow process for commodity chemicals, the synthesis of more sophisticated building blocks often takes considerable effort. We disclose efficient access routes to organo(chloro)silanes, &#8208;silyl ethers, and &#8208;siloxanes with vicinal Si centers, which are promising precursors for ditopic Lewis acids and hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic polymers.







Abstract
Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8722;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8722;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8722;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.

Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8722;Cl bonds in 1,2-(Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin) or catechol (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat), which act as Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;-bridging and/or Si-chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, which contains a benzannulated eight-membered C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-pin) ring with Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;-bridging pin moiety, furnishes &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; with a benzannulated five-membered C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8722;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; gives the &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-disila-2-oxaindane &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; with high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8208; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8208; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8208; ORR. In a 2 M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade cationic Rhodamine B or methyl orange and anionic methylene blue dyes in water.

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40 nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5 W h kg&#8208;1, high power output of 166 W kg&#8208;1, and 93.09% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>MoSe2&#8208;Sensitized Water Splitting Assisted by C60&#8208;Dendrons on the Basal Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoirradiation of a water dispersion of MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) proceeded in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.







Abstract
To facilitate water splitting using MoSe2 as a light absorber, we fabricated water&#8208;dispersible MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids via physical modification of the basal plane of MoSe2. Upon photoirradiation, the mixed&#8208;dimension MoSe2/C60 (2D/0D) heterojunction generates a charge&#8208;separated state (MoSe2&#8901;+/C60&#8901;&#8722;) through electron extraction from the exciton in MoSe2 to C60. This process is followed by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.

Triarylamines are frequently employed as electron donor functional groups in a variety of organic electronic materials. We herein report the synthesis and in&#8208;depth characterisation of aza&#8208;analogues of fully bridged triarylamines, consisting of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triarylamines are frequently employed as electron donor functional groups in a variety of organic electronic materials. We herein report the synthesis and in-depth characterisation of aza-analogues of fully bridged triarylamines, consisting of 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. The impact of nitrogen doping and &#960;-extension on the structural, electronic and optical-properties of these contorted heteroaromatic PAHs is thoroughly investigated and paves the way for an improved understanding of the structure-property relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol walled acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors function as solid state sequestrants for iodine from the vapor phase with uptake capacities reaching 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 for H2. The uptake process involves both chemisorption (oxidation of H2; reduction of I2) and physisorption processes (uptake of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;). H2 can be regenerated by treatment with aq. Na2S2O4 and reused five times.







Abstract
Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including 129I and 131I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (H1&#8211;H4) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that H2&#8211;H4, but not H1 &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1.5&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, and 1.9&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled H2 to quinone walled host and capture of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;. Solid H2 can be regenerated by treatment with Na2S2O4 and reused at least five times. The x&#8208;ray crystal structure of H2 is also reported.

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation catalysis has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable energy conversion. Among molecular catalysts, [Fe(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes have exhibited notable turning&#8208;over rates. Although various [M(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes (M = Mn, Co, Ni) have been synthesized, however, the role of active centres has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we apply our newly developed catalytic models, efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and the maximum kinetic efficiency MaxKinEff framework to assess the role of the active centres in its catalytic performance. Our computational analysis identifies cobalt&#8208;based [Co(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] as a superior alternative for water oxidation reactions. Notably, cobalt catalysts exhibit a longer lifespan (~ 44 days) and higher turnover numbers (TON), with computed values of &#160;(ECM) = 3.30 h&#8208;1, &#160;(ECM) = 3456, (MaxKinEff) = 12.43 h&#8208;1, and &#160;(MaxKinEff) = 3616. These findings suggest that cobalt could play a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of molecular catalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorodefluorination Induced by Gallium&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report on the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl gallium compounds by selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms in [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)]. First evidence for the catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] in chlorodefluorination reactions was obtained.







Abstract
The reaction of [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)] with chlorotrimethylsilane leads to the selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms and thus to the formation of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)]. The corresponding chlorogallate ion, [Ga(CCl2CF3)3Cl]&#8722;, could be isolated and structurally characterized as its tetraphenylphosphonium salt. The catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] was demonstrated via the chlorodefluorination of Me3SiCF3, 2,2&#8208;difluoropropane and [PPh4][Ga(C2F5)4].

         <title>Comparative Study of PtM (M=Cu, Zn, Ga, Mn, Fe, In, Ce) Bimetals on Zincosilicate for Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilising zincosilicate support and a straightforward ion&#8208;exchange method, this study obtains a range of non&#8208;precious M monometallic catalysts and PtM bimetallic catalysts (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). With an enhanced propane dehydrogenation capability, the improved catalyst PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 can be operated in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C for at least 168&#8197;hours without significant deactivation.







Abstract
Silicoaluminate zeolites have relatively strong Br&#246;nsted (B) acid properties that can easily lead to deep cracking reactions, making them less favourable as carriers for propane dehydrogenation. Here, we utilise zincosilicate zeolite with less B&#8208;acid produced by the introduction of the heteroatom Zn into the framework as a carrier, followed by simultaneous ion exchange (IE) of M monometallic or PtM bimetallic (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). The optimized PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 exhibits a superior propane dehydrogenation performance over PtCu/Zn&#8208;4 and PtGa/Zn&#8208;4, which can achieve a propane conversion of about 30&#8201;% in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C and can be operated for at least 168&#8197;h without significant deactivation. Characterization techniques such as spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy with different gas adsorptions are used to investigate these PtM@zeolite catalysts in order to deepen the understanding of acid site identification, promoter effect and catalysis.

We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N=extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960;&#8208;&#960;*/1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260&#8211;350&#8197;nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350&#8211;550&#8197;nm range. Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2&#8208;N,N&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50~6&#8197;&#956;M, PI&gt;9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC=0.918) of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9&#8197;times higher photo&#8208;toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type&#8197;II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type&#8197;I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Metal Complexes Using Dissolving Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General principles and recent advances in the electrochemical generation of metal complexes using dissolving anodes are discussed. The use of electrochemistry enables control of the metal oxidation state, reduces waste streams, and allows the incorporation of base&#8208;sensitive functionality in the products. The electrochemical method provides a means to rapidly produce large libraries of metal complexes for development of catalytic reactions.







Abstract
The use of dissolving metal electrodes for the direct electrochemical synthesis of metal complexes has been used widely in the last decade. A major benefit of the electrochemical approach is the minimal by&#8208;products resulting from the synthesis. As such, metal complexes can be produced on&#8208;demand and used directly in catalysis without the need for purification. Furthermore, the electrochemical method enables the production of metal complexes that cannot be synthesized using other methods, including those with base&#8208;sensitive ligands. General principles of the electrochemical method and recent advances in the field are discussed.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonization Synthesis of N, S Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials Derived from Agricultural Waste Peanut Shells for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No wasting of waste: N, S co&#8208;doped carbon material (NPSC&#8208;4) was prepared by using agricultural waste peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using NPSC&#8208;4 not only has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, but also has good application value.







Abstract
Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co&#8208;doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2&#8197;g and 4&#8197;g, respectively, the prepared NSPC&#8208;4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure. Elemental analysis showed that the activator introduced more N, S and O atoms to the carbon material, and more heteroatoms helped to improve the surface structure of the carbon material and provide additional pseudocapacitance. In addition, NSPC&#8208;4 contains a short&#8208;range ordered graphite structure, which can provide excellent electrical conductivity. The electrochemical test results show that NSPC&#8208;4 has the largest specific capacitance. When the mass of the activator is higher than or below 4&#8197;g, the electrochemical performance of the carbon material will be reduced. The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by NSPC&#8208;4 has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 when the power density is 350&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The synthesis method is not only simple, green and economical, but also has important application value.

         <title>Toward Molecular Textiles: Synthesis and Characterization of Molecular Patches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of exploring and establishing a new fabrication method towards molecular textiles, molecular patches, which are smaller structural analogues, are investigated. The working principle of molecular patch formation, relies on a bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped covalent templated monomer, that via in&#8208;solution synthesis forms macrocyclic oligomers, which upon template cleavage result into linear fragments.







Abstract
This works describes a new step into the assembly of molecular textiles by the use of covalent templating. To establish a well&#8208;founded base and to tackle pre&#8208;mature obstacles, expected during the fabrication of the desired 2D&#8208;material, we opted to investigate the in&#8208;solution synthesis of molecular patches e.&#8201;g. cut&#8208;outs of a textile. A bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped monomer was designed, synthesized and was in&#8208;detail characterized by means of 1H&#8208;NMR and chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopy. In addition, x&#8208;ray structure crystallography was used to assess the absolute configuration. The monomer was used in an in&#8208;solution oligomerization to assemble the molecular patches via imine condensation, which revealed the formation of predominately dimeric patches. The imine&#8208;oligomer mixtures were further analyzed by reduction and cleaved to investigate the conditions required post mono&#8208;layer assembly. All reaction stages were followed by FT&#8208;IR and 1H&#8208;NMR analysis. Finally, we address the adsorption of the cross&#8208;shaped monomer onto a Au(111) surface, via high vacuum electrospray deposition. The subsequent annealing of the interface induced the on&#8208;surface imine condensation reaction, leading to unidimensional oligomers co&#8208;adsorbed with clusters of cyclic&#8208;dimers. Nc&#8208;AFM analysis revealed the tridimensional molecular structures, and together with electrospray deposition technique showed to be a promising pathway to investigate potential monomer candidates.

         <title>Multilevel Dynamic System as Molecular Morning&#8208;After Timer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalistic bilayer dynamic library was prepared using disulfide/dithioacetal/thiol exchanges, and its final steady composition was used to obtain information about the timing, duration, and intensity of a past, apparently traceless event that transitorily altered the molecular network wiring.







Abstract
Systems chemistry aims to develop molecular systems that display emerging properties arising from their network and absent in their individual constituents. Employing reversible chemistry under thermodynamic control represents a valuable tool for generating dynamic combinatorial libraries of interconverting molecules, which may exhibit intriguing collective behaviour. A simple dynamic combinatorial library was prepared using dithioacetal/thiol/disulfide exchanges. Because of the relative reactivities of these reversible reactions, the library constitutes a two&#8208;layer dynamic system with one layer active in an acid medium (thiol/dithioacetal exchange) and one layer active in a basic medium (thiol/disulfide exchange). This property enables the system to respond to momentary changes in acidity of the medium by activating different network regions, channeling some building blocks from one layer to another through shared thiol reagents (nodes). This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.

This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron adducts with reversible bonding that dissociate slowly and completely are difficult to achieve. A new kind of dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) is reported that features dissociation kinetics in the day&#8208;to&#8208;week range. Furthermore, we investigated by substitution on various positions how the equilibrium reaction between DOAB, phenylboronic acids (BA) and diethanolamines (DEA) in water can be adjusted.







Abstract
We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103&#8197;M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent's steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1&#8201;% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Reduction of Nitroarenes with Formate Salts as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using the formate salt as the reductant is developed. A range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into value&#8208;added anilines under blue light irradiation. Mechanistic studies revealed that arene thiol radicals and CO2&#8901;&#8722; are key intermediates for the transformation. The protocol represents a transition metal free and green example for the realization of such transformations.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using formate salts as the reductant was developed. A wide range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into aniline products in a transition metal free fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that radical species (carbon dioxide radical anion and thiol radical) are key intermediates for the transformation. We anticipate that this method will provide a valuable and green strategy for the reduction of nitrobenzenes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#981;f = 20%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f = 9 ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red = +1.6 V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4 phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core&#8208;shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic. Herein, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67, a core&#8208;shell material with simultaneous acid&#8208;base bifunctionality, was synthesized by seeded epitaxial growth. It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF&#8208;based Pickering emulsions interfacial catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M = Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine&#8217;s olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M = Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination / oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we describe a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of&#160;tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Borenium Ion Equivalents Stabilized by BICAAC and Their Implementation as Catalysts in Hydrosilylation of Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 with MeOTf, forms the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8208; on reaction with Lewis bases (L = pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0 mol% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200 h&#8208;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Trimethyl Lock Based Tools for Drug Delivery and Cell Imaging &#8211; Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trimethyl lock (TML) systems have become increasingly important in medicinal and bioorganic chemistry, particularly for their roles in the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents and as integral components in fluorogenic probes for cellular imaging. The simplicity and efficiency of their synthesis have established TML systems as versatile platforms for the controlled release of active molecules under particular physiological conditions. This review consolidates recent advancements in the application of TML systems, with a focus on their use in drug delivery, cellular imaging, and other areas where precise molecular release is crucial. Additionally, we discuss the synthetic strategies employed to construct TML&#8208;based conjugates, underscoring their potential to enhance the specificity and efficacy of bioactive compounds in various biomedical applications.</dc:description>

The highest tensile strength of 40.47 MPa and modulus of 1.49 GPa were observed for the hybrid composites fabricated from 0.75 and 1.0 wt.% GO treated fly ash. Interestingly, this trend differed for flexural properties, and the highest flexural strength of 53.52 MPa was demonstrated by 0.5 wt.% GO treated FA hybrid composite. Thermal characterization revealed that addition of fiber increased crystallinity but decreased thermal stability, whereas a good wettability of the fiber and FA in matrix was demonstrated through morphological characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using a vibratory ball mill: bromination, imidization and Heck&#8208;type reactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step solvent free synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent dimidiation were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5 hours&#8217; reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24 hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5 hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;P type charge compensatory synergistic effect for Schottky and efficient photoelectrocatalysis applications: Doping mechanism in (Nb/Re)@WS2/graphene heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Band gap engineering based on doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has shown great potential in the design and development of new nano photoelectronic devices and their application in photoelectrocatalysis. However, there are two key issues that are difficult to take into account, namely the impurity levels induced by dopant atoms appear in the forbidden band of the doping system, which can become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with the carrier mobility of the corresponding doped systems, that of intrinsic 2D TMDs is too low. Understanding the doping mechanism of heteroatoms in these systems and designing corresponding crystal structures rationally is important for solving these problems. In this study, the crystal structures of co&#8208;doped monolayer WS2 with Nb and Re atoms were designed using density functional theory, and doping systems with graphene (high carrier mobility) were assembled into a heterostructure using the concept of heterorecombination. The N&#8208;P type co&#8208;doping of Nb and Re atoms retained the continuous band characteristics of the original monolayer WS2 while also providing the high carrier mobility of graphene, yielding an excellent multipurpose material for manufacturing high&#8208;speed Schottky devices and efficient water&#8208;splitting H evolution catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Amphiphiles Based on Azadipyrromethenes: Consecutive Pathways to Nanodiscs and Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways of 1a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1a firstly aggregated into the kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non&#8208;fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max = 594 nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J&#8208;band (&#955;max =693 nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760 nm (&#1060;fl = 0.1), which could be ascribed to the J&#8208;aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg. I.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A), a non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of tri&#8208;methylated lysine residues at the 9, 27, and 36 positions of histone H3 (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3). These methylated residues show contrasting transcriptional roles; therefore, understanding KDM4A&#8217;s catalytic mechanisms with these substrates is essential to explain the factors that control the different sequence&#8208;dependent demethylations. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD)&#8208;based combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to investigate determinants of KDM4A catalysis with H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 substrates. In KDM4A&#8208;H3(5&#8208;14)K9me3 and KDM4A&#8208;H3(23&#8208;32)K27me3 ferryl complexes, the O&#8208;H distance positively correlates with the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step, however in the KDM4A&#8208;H3(32&#8208;41)K36me3, no direct one&#8208;to&#8208;one relationship was found implying that the synergistic effects between the geometric parameters, second sphere interactions and the intrinsic electric field contribute for the effective catalysis for this substrate. The intrinsic electric field along the Fe&#8208;O bond changes between the three complexes and shows a positive correlation with the HAT activation barrier, suggesting that modulating electric field can be used for fine engineering KDM catalysis with a specific substrate. The results reveal how KDM4A uses a combination of strategies to enable near equally efficient demethylation of different H3Kme3 residues.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intricate interplay of metabolic reactions and molecular assembly in living systems enables spatiotemporally organization and gives rise to diverse dynamic behaviors that characterize life. Over the last decades, research efforts have increasingly focused on replicating the remarkable properties and characteristics of living systems, driving the rapid growth of systems chemistry. This young discipline which generally studies interacting molecular networks and emergent system&#8208;level properties, behaviors, and functions, offers new concepts and tools to tackle the complexity of life. In this review paper, we have explored seminal research and recent advancements in recreating dynamic behaviors of life with systems chemistry. We believe that the recreation of the dynamic behaviors of life through systems chemistry would set the initial steps to obtain synthetic life de novo.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction of a Tetrakis(porphyrin) in Various Chiral Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions offer an alternative way for developing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials such as sensors, machines, and drug&#8208;delivery systems. We recently reported that a urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution in response to chirality of chiral solvents. Conformational changes in helical sense were detected using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which showed that the tetrakis(porphyrin) can possibly be used as a sensor for determining the enantiomeric excess of a chiral analyte. Hence, we studied the scope and limitations of the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) to deepen the understanding of tetrakis(porphyrin)&#8208;based chiral sensing systems. Herein, we report the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) in various chiral solvents, which was found to be CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents. Notably, the tetrakis(porphyrin) was CD active in a cryptochiral molecular solvent, which is exciting because the chiralities of acyclic saturated hydrocarbons are hard to sense. Consequently, this study highlights the potential advantages of supramolecular chiral sensors capable of targeting a wide range of analytes, including molecules that are absorption&#8208;silent in the UV/vis region, ones devoid of anchoring functional groups, and acyclic, saturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>The Roles of Molecular Concavities in the Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Tetrahedra for CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant tetrahedral molecules have sparked significant interest in the past decade due to their unique and diverse supramolecular nanostructures. The longer and bulkier peripheral substituents create deep molecular concavities and thus contribute to the different self&#8208;assembly behaviors compared to the conventional small tetrahedral molecules. In this study, a molecular giant tetrahedra, TetraNDI, was synthesized to investigate the important roles of the molecular concavities in the self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Single&#8208;crystal structural characterizations indicate that the TetraNDI takes its trigonal concavities to form 1D supramolecular columns, and its tetragonal concavities to reach close inter&#8208;columnar packing. The difficulty in occupying the concavities leads to the path&#8208;dependent phase behaviors of the giant tetrahedra. It is also found that the remaining molecular concavities in the supramolecular scaffolds affect the CO2 affinity of TetraNDI. With an understanding of the packing principles of molecular giant tetrahedra, the structure&#8208;property relationships could be better evaluated in the future and might broaden the horizon of porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>B12&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of Carbon Tetrahalides: Using a Broad Range of Visible Light to Access Diverse Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic synthesis is a green and sustainable method for producing fine chemicals and is highly desirable at both laboratory and industrial scales. In this study, we developed a broad&#8208;range (including the red region) visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F with nucleophiles, such as amines and alcohols, using a B12&#8211;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. Carbonyl molecules such as ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides were synthesized with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. Diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, femtosecond time&#8208;resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed the reaction mechanism is a combination of SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer. This is a rare example of a low&#8208;energy, red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis, which has been a highly desired organic reaction in recent years. We believe that this study provides a general platform to access diverse carbonyl molecules and could promote photocatalytic carbonylation reactions on a pilot scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Ruthenium(II)&#8722;Halocarbon Complexes Derived from Ru(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Homopropargylic Halopyridines: Mechanism, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm = 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X = F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Electron&#160;NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects&#160;and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe&#8217;s higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8208;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid elelctrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M, M = Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co achieves high FECO (100%), CO generation rate (10.9 mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) and energy efficiency (69%), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhibition of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation and cholinesterase activity are two major therapeutic targets for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic Ab aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo&#8208;stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu(II) and Zn(II)] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of A&#946; aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;bound amyloid&#8208;&#946;, (iii) ex&#8208;vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with A&#946; peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer&#8217;s disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Radical Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals are gaining significant interest in luminescent materials due to their unique properties, which present unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various fields, from display technology to biomedical applications. However, addressing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency is crucial to unlocking their full potential for practical applications. Polymerization has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions, enabling the creation of stable luminescent radicals with excellent processing and multifunctional properties. This concept emphasizes the strategic use of polymerization in designing and synthesizing stable main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain radical polymers. This approach not only broadens the scope of stable radicals but also improves their luminescence properties as photofunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient and selective synthesis of renewable isoprene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of renewable isoprene continues to attract significant interest, yet catalysts still need improvement for industrial applications. We report herein an efficient and novel Prins tandem approach for highly selective production of isoprene from bio&#8208;based methanol and isobutene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 acid&#8208;base bifunctional catalysts. Hydration decreases the number of strong basic sites O2&#8208; ions and increases OH groups over MgO, thus improving the isoprene selectivity. Basic OH on Mg(OH)2 promotes the Prins condensation of formaldehyde and isobutene, while acidic OH promotes dehydration of isoprenol to isoprene. Suitable contents and proportions of basic and acidic OH groups over Mg(OH)2 increase isoprene selectivity and methanol conversion to 90 and 92% on the Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O+Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts, respectively. It exhibits good recycling stability, with isoprene selectivity remaining 90% after five successive regenerations. DFT calculations reveal OH groups formed after hydration reduce the energy barrier of the H transfer step, thereby promoting the overall reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with Windmill Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and computational investigation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Following our method for the preparation of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs, we prepared pyrrole&#8208;, indole&#8208;, carbazole&#8208;, and 1H&#8208;benz[g]indole&#8208;substituted HBCs from the corresponding fluorinated precursors under microwave irradiation. A series of polysubstituted benzoindole&#8208;HBCs with windmill architectures was also synthesized using the polyfluorinated HBC analogs. Due to the circular arrangement of the benzoindole moiety, the attachment of multiple substituents results in the presence of multiple conformers at room temperature. The rotation barrier can be overcome by heating the compounds to 323&#8208;333 K. Additionally, the investigation of the relaxed geometries shows two &#960;&#8208;stacking motifs within the conformers. Similar to the thioether substituted HBCs, the nature of the heterocycle does not influence the optoelectronic properties of the HBC core. The attachment of multiple benzoindole substituents leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission spectra, comparable to our previous studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;alternant Benzodifluoranthene Tetraimides from 7,8,9,10&#8208;Fluoranthene Diimides: Synthesis, Structure, and Optical&#8208;Limiting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel tetraimide&#8208;functionalized non&#8208;alternant &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely, benzodifluoranthene tetraimides (BDFTI), has been designed and synthesized through highly efficient UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged fluoranthene diimide dimer (i.e., FDI&#8208;V). The synthesis of FDI&#8208;V starts from a straightforward three&#8208;step route to produce novel 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDIs) building&#8208;blocks, followed by nearly complete bromination and then Stille&#8208;coupling reaction to give the desired dimer. The analysis by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms a near&#8208;coplanar geometry for FDIs, while BDFTI shows a U&#8208;shaped and distorted backbone configuration proven by theoretical optimizations. The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron&#8208;deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;&#8208;frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open&#8208;aperture Z&#8208;scan technique, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged FDI&#8208;V. The versatile UV&#8208;photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high&#8208;performance optical&#8208;limiting materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for high current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a pressing requirement for commercial industrial electrolyzers. In this study, a vertical 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure was developed through interface engineering to enhance the advantages of each component and expose numerous active sites. Experimental investigations and density functional theory&#160;calculations demonstrate significant electronic coupling at the interface between 1T'&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2, with suitable Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 heterostructure catalyst achieves high current density HER with low overpotentials of 191 mV to generate up to 800 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, outperforming commercial 5% Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and long&#8208;term durability, illustrating a successful approach to designing efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen production through interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Engineering of Flower&#8208;like Co 2 P/WO 3&#8208;x /Carbon Cloth Catalysts with Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8208;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC)&#160;surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8208;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0 M KOH solution, Co2P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32 mV dec&#8208;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8208;x&#160;can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Reactions of Aminocatalytic Dienamines and Trienamines Initiated by a Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloadditions are widely accepted as a group of reactions that rapidly generate molecular complexity. Being highly atom economic and often predictable, these reactions can generate up to four stereogenic centers and two C&#8208;C (or C&#8208;X) bonds in one reaction step. During the last two decades, asymmetric aminocatalysis has shown to be a successful strategy for controlling stereoselectivity and enabling reactivity of cycloaddition reactions. By increasing the conjugation of the carbonyl species employed, dienamines and trienamines can be catalytically formed. Not only can these facilitate the cycloaddition, often accompanied by high levels of stereocontrol, but they also leave a residual enamine or carbonyl (by hydrolysis) in the cycloadduct. This residual functionality can engage in further intramolecular reactions generating complex cyclic systems in a one&#8208;pot cascade manner. In this regard, asymmetric aminocatalysis can add another layer of complexity to the already complex nature of cycloadditions. In this review, we will present the general concept of such reactivity patterns of dienamines and trienamines, and hereafter showcase examples in the literature. We aspire that the chemical community can use these concepts to design new enantioselective aminocatalytic cascade reactions to access enantioenriched, complex compounds, and perhaps use these in complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenazinium&#8208; and Malachite Green&#8208;Based Pd(II) Cages: Chiroptical Discrimination of Nucleoside Triphosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5% for 50 mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.</dc:description>

The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett.

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties.

In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post-synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#160;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Triarylmethanol Derivatives with Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7 seconds. Its multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7 &#181;s to 818 ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots Enabling High&#8208;Performances Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Na ions doped Fe2VO4 cathode for high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g&#8208;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g&#8208;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8208;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>
