      <title>A comparative study on the photophysical properties of anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins</title>
      <dc:description>Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g. fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.).

      <title>Rapid Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation as a Direct Route to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
      <dc:description>A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted&#160; to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the immobilization of cobalt catalysts on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8209;homogeneous catalysts towards an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles,  via  the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins we achieved a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8209;conversion&#160;with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s  &#8208;1  and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, we prepared a series of novel &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives that feature excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#160;nm, quantum yields around 70&#160;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.4&#160;kJ/mol and outstanding thermal stability with T  1/2  &#160;(25&#160;&#176;C) over 100 days.

      <dc:description>The ligand H  3  L (6&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), which exhibits two different coordination pockets, has been exploited to engender and study energy transfer (ET) in two dinuclear [Ln(III)Ln(III)&#8217;] analogues of interest, [EuYb] and [NdYb]. Their structural and physical properties have been compared with the also newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu] and [GdYb], respectively) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between Eu(III) and Yb(III) does not occur to a significant extent, while emission from Yb(III) originates via sensitization from the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two Nd(III) centers in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], where Yb(III) luminescence is thus in part sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces on nickel&#8208;copper double hydroxide nanotyres to pre&#8208;activate alkaline ammonia oxidation reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>The surface hydroxyls of NixCu1&#8208;x(OH)2  play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8208;xOx(OH)  2&#8208;x  during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, we for the first time report the rational&#160;design of hierarchical porous  NiCu double hydroxide  nanotyres (NiCu DHTs)  by  considering rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e. annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8208;function&#160;relationship is conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31 V with 7.52 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9 &#181;M), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors. This work deepens the understanding of the crucial role of surface hydroxyls on determining the catalytic performance in alkaline medium.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Cathodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries: Materials, Mechanisms, and Kinetics</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are the most promising rechargeable batteries for the grid energy storage and industrial energy storage for its lower cost and higher safety. There are three main problems, which are the major obstacle to the development of ZIBs. One is the cathode electrode and finding a suitable cathode material is the foundation to solve above problem. The cathode materials consist of Mn&#8208;based materials, V&#8208;based materials, Prussian blue analogous (PBAs), Quinone and the others materials. The second is the reaction mechanisms of Zn2+ ions storage in ZIBs. The third is the improving reaction kinetics of insertion and diffusion of Zn2+ in the cathode materials. Read more in the Review by J. Liu et&#8197;al. on page 830.

PET&#8211;fluorescence multimodal probes provide complimentary information for medical diagnoses. Such probes enable specific functional imaging of a disease state from initial diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) scans, followed by high spatial resolution, real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging during intraoperative excision of the diseased tissue. Some of the most promising candidates for such imaging probes include quantum dots, rhenium(I) complexes, cyanine and BODIPY dyes, as well as other organic fluorophores.

      <title>Computational insight into the different mechanisms of Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes and sulfonyl hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthesis intermediates, material and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition metal carbene and hindered alkene is generally lower than 50%. To solve this problem, addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkene catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl  2  was studied but side reactions still could not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation for such hindered alkenes was as high as 99% with AgOTf as catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). By combining the results of these calculations with the experimental ones, we concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled binaphthyl&#8208;bridged amphiphilic AABB phthalocyanines: nanostructures for efficient antimicrobial photodynamic&#160;therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral Zn(II)Pcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents) containing differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in water media and have proved efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The size average of the nanoparticles is determined by the substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, it influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a non&#8208;substituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PS present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective in killing both types of strains, showing an outstanding photoinactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.</dc:description>

      <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulating the subtle equilibria in the given system. We demonstrate this for the case of tetranuclear europium helical cage that is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, we bring the experimental evidence that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky noncoordinating counterions that may trigger self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with noncoordinating anions enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;linking by 1,1'&#8208;Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross&#8208;Linker</title>
      <dc:description>Two series of 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L = OAc, OCH  3  , OCHCH=CH  2  , OCH  2  Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph  3  P  +  ) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two series of 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L = OAc, OCH  3  , OCHCH=CH  2  , OCH  2  Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph  3  P  +  ) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited state compounds. Herein, we study the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state. Though a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, we define a set of guidelines to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components and subsequently test the validity of the guidelines on larger systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Proanthocyanins&#8208;capped biogenic TiO2 nanoparticles with enhanced penetration, antibacterial and ROS mediated inhibition of bacteria proliferation and biofilm formation: A comparative approach</title>
      <dc:description>The biofunctionalized TiO2 NPs, having a size range of 18.42 &#177; 1.3 nm were synthesized employing single step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) mediated proanthocyanins (PACs) polyphenols. The present study purposes to examine the effect of PACs rich GSE corona on (i) the stability and dispersity of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs, their (ii) anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy and (iii) propensity of internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in  P. aeruginosa  and&#160;  S. saprophyticus  strains. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate NPs formation.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The biofunctionalized TiO2 NPs, having a size range of 18.42 &#177; 1.3 nm were synthesized employing single step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) mediated proanthocyanins (PACs) polyphenols. The present study purposes to examine the effect of PACs rich GSE corona on (i) the stability and dispersity of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs, their (ii) anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy and (iii) propensity of internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in  P. aeruginosa  and&#160;  S. saprophyticus  strains. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate NPs formation.

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable

antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosylation steps.

The rhamnosylated C1&#8208;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8208;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semi&#8208;glycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

      <title>Tuning the regioselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes via lanthanum&#8208;mediated single C&#8208;F bond activation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new fluorine containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. We herein present the highly regio and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes using a simple La/I  2  /DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8208;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provides homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF  2  &#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF  3  group in a diene has been observed, which according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis acidic lanthanum metal.</dc:description>

      <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: a Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>As a significant branch of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have obtained widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities of generating other photo&#8208;responsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photo&#8208;responsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands play a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most of CHPMs are built from photo&#8208;deformable or photo&#8208;responsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost, which greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore new families of CHPMs compared with the existing CHPMs. Herein, we report a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs via decorating metal nitrate with coplanar bipyridine moiety 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen). The resulting products exhibit apparent photo&#8208;coloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron&#8208;transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO  3  &#8208;  species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of coordination environment and central metal ions on photochromism have also been studied. Our work has demonstrated that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrate as &#960;&#8208;EDs under the collaboration of ET and coordination assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbone itself might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. Conceptually parallel process could allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we synthesized three types of 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns: a symmetric dimer with a C&#8211;C bond between the monomer units (  1  ) and two asymmetric dimers with a C&#8211;N bond between the monomer units (  2  and  3  ). The structure&#8208;property relationship of  1  &#8211;  3  were investigated. X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis revealed that the two DHDAT units are completely planar in the C&#8211;C linked dimer  1  whereas the monomer units are perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8211;N linked dimers  2  and  3  in the crystals. Reflecting their molecular structures, the electronic interaction between the two monomer units is larger in  1  and very little in  2  and  3  in the ground states. However, the emission behavior of  3  is remarkably different from those of other dimers and its monomer. The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective cross&#8208;coupling of unsaturated substrates on Al(I)</title>
      <dc:description>The Al(I) compound NacNacAl ( 1 , NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr] &#8210; , Ar = 2,6&#8208; i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 ) serves as a template for the chemoselective coupling between carbonyls (benzophenone, fenchone, isophorone, p &#8208;tolyl benzoate, N,N &#8208;dimethyl benzamide, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline) and pyridine. With the CH&#8208;acidic ketone (1R)&#8208;(+) camphor, the reaction affords a hydrido alkoxide compound of Al, formed as the result of enolization, whereas an enolizable imine, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline, and the bulky ketone isophorone, still chemoselectively couple with pyridine. In contrast, reaction with the ester p &#8208;tolyl benzoate results in cleavage of the ester bond together with replacement of the alkoxy group by a hydrogen atom of the pyridine moiety. This study demonstrates that for carbonyl substrates featuring phenyl substituents, the reaction proceeds via intermediate formation of h 2 (C,X)&#8208;coordinated (X =O, N) carbonyl adducts, whereas the reaction of 1 with (R)&#8208;(&#8210;)&#8208;fenchone in the absence of pyridine leads to CH activation in the pendant isopropyl group of the Ar substituent of the NacNac ligand.</dc:description>

      <title>The Effect of Auxiliary Nitrogenated Linkers on the Design of New Cadmium Based Coordination Polymers as Sensors for Detection of Explosive Materials</title>

      <title>Tuning tetrazole photochemistry for protein ligation and molecular imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles&#160;featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents&#160;to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395 nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and theaza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with&#160;89Zr,&#160;64Cu and&#160;68Ga radionuclides.&#160;DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with&#160;89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable&#160;in vitro&#160;and retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing human SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Catalytic&#160; Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Besides, it provides materials with distinct features, such as nanocrystallinity, high defect concentration, and close interaction of the components in a system, which are, in most cases, unattainable by conventional routes. Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the straightforwardness of the mechanochemical route &#8208; in contrast to more conventional synthesis &#8208; in fabricating the materials, which otherwise often require harsh conditions. Distinct material properties achieved by mechanochemistry are related to their improved catalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Trends and prospects of bimetallic exsolution</title>
      <dc:description>Supported bimetallic nanoparticles used for various chemical transformations appear to be more appealing than their monometallic counterparts, because of their unique properties mainly originating from the synergistic effects between the two different metals. Exsolution, a relatively new preparation method for supported nanoparticles, has earned increasing attention for bimetallic systems in the past decade, not only due to the high stability of the resulting nanoparticles but also for the potential to control key particle properties (size, composition, structure, morphology, etc.). In this review,  we summarize the trends and advances on exsolution of bimetallic systems and provide prospects for future studies  &#160;in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate Derived Metal Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterial for advanced targeted delivery applications. Implementation of external stimuli controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. In this paper, we present the synthesis of a carbohydrate derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on Zn2+ presence: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is to our knowledge the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a single liposome study, we found that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. Upon addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.</dc:description>

Importantly, the composite also facilitates the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction.

      <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Unsatisfied oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskite for the&#160;low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal via an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, that are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C  3  H  8  ) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces high&#160;distortion of LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces large proportion of bulk Co  2+  &#160;species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Besides, surface Co  3+  &#160;species, as the acid sites, that are active for cleaving C&#8208;H bond of C  3  H  8  &#160;molecule are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co: B = 0.93: 0.07) displays the best C  3  H  8  &#160;oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO  2  &#160;and H  2  O for a lasting 200 h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites via the regulation&#160;of amorphous boron&#8208;dispersion.</dc:description>

As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co: B = 0.93: 0.07) displays the best C  3  H  8  &#160;oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO  2  &#160;and H  2  O for a lasting 200 h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites via the regulation&#160;of amorphous boron&#8208;dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high&#8208;fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuAAC chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties, whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable anticancer activity of furoylthiourea&#8208;based Ru(II)&#8208;arene complexes and their mechanism of action</title>
      <dc:description>Fourteen new Ru(II)&#8208;arene (benzene/  p  &#8208;cymene) complexes (  C1  &#8208;  C14  ) were synthesized by varying the  N  &#8208;terminal substituent in furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential (ESP) maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of the Ru&#8208;  p  &#8208;cymene and Ru&#8208;benzene complexes was found to be opposite. All the complexes were highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, wherein  C5  (Ru&#8208;  p  &#8208;cymene complex containing C  6  H  2  (CH  3  )  3  as  N  &#8208;terminal substituent) and  C13  (Ru&#8208;benzene complex containing C  6  H  4  (CF  3  ) as  N  &#8208;terminal substituent) showed the highest activity among each set of the complexes, and hence they were chosen for further studies. These complexes showed dissimilar behaviour in aqueous solutions and were also seen to catalytically oxidize GSH. These complexes promoted cell death  via  apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The complexes also showed good binding ability with Pim&#8208;1 kinase and VEGFR2 receptors, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.</dc:description>

      <title>A robust mesoporous Al2O3 based nanocomposite catalyst for abundant NOx storage with rational design of Pt and Ba species</title>
      <dc:description>The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been robbed by the less stability of ordered mesoporous structure. Herein, we demonstrated rational design to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage property due to the presence of Ba species over well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al  2  O  3  ) support. It was found that Ba species were successfully impregnated only after the stabilization of the mesoporous structure by full crystallization of Al  2  O  3  frameworks to its &#947;&#8208;phase, coinciding formation of Pt nanoparticles with complete removal of organic components. All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, which is applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and characterization of a hetero&#8208;dinuclear compound, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif is further analyzed by temperature dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies reveal a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen.
