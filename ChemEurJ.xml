         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of the reductive coupling of chlorosilanes by nickel catalysis. This method enables cheap, stable, and readily available carbon and silicon reagents to be coupled, offering a mild and high functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerance route to synthesize organosilanes.







Abstract
Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This Concept article summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8722;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Hypervalent Compounds with Germanium(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>

Ge&#8208;fused azobenzene compounds: Hypervalent compounds with a germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffold exhibiting NIR emission despite the compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The synergistic effect between a hypervalent bond and the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation is a novel and effective strategy for obtaining NIR emissive materials.







Abstract
A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, hypervalent compounds with germanium (Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds were discovered that can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL=690&#8764;721&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=0.03&#8764;0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclosed that the germanium&#8208;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3&#8201;c&#8211;4&#8201;e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL=770&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.10) and film (&#955;PL=807&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM measurements together with SEM and AFM are used to determine the intrinsic activity of two different crystallographic planes available at a single hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface exposing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and a particle thickness of 100&#8197;nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270&#177;68&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. The higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles, which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the high ionization energy of imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with oxidants have been postulated to occur via a transient NHC radical cation intermediate. Herein, we propose the alternative mechanism to explain the outcome of the tritylium reaction with IPr without the intermediacy of unstable [IPr]&#8901;+.







Abstract
Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#8901;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#8901;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3&#8201;a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8722;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#8901;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3&#8201;a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.

Diazatriphenylene was synthesized by a double, one&#8208;carbon&#8208;insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented NiII&#8208;bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one&#8208;electron oxidation.

A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its NiII complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted NiII insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O resulted an ESR active, NiII bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic NiII complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8722;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The NiII bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic NiII complex by single&#8208;electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic NiII complex and the radical NiII complex exhibited ligand&#8208;centered redox behavior, whereas the NiII remains in the +2 oxidation state.

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oleyl ligands are known as good dispersants for stabilizing nanoparticles in less&#8208;polar solvents; however, the structure&#8208;dispersibility relationships remain unclear. We synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the relationship and reveal that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8211;chain crystallization as well as interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, can contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which might affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. We have synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance revealed that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors in enhancing dispersibility.

         <title>Diarylethene Isomerization by Using Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single green light source is used to selectively control both the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing reactions of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches, by using green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Whilst using TTA&#8208;UC to trigger the ring&#8208;closing reaction, the green light also induces fluorescence from the colored closed isomer of the DAE, which was used as an in&#8208;situ readout to monitor the isomerization process.







Abstract
Green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion with the well&#8208;studied upconversion pair 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA)/platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) was used to reversibly drive the photoisomerization of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches by using visible light. By carefully selecting the kinetic and spectral properties of the molecular system as well as the experimental geometry, a single green light source can be used to selectively trigger both the ring&#8208;opening and the ring&#8208;closing reactions, whilst also inducing fluorescence from the colored closed isomer that can be used as a readout to monitor the isomerization process in&#8197;situ. The upconversion solution and the DAE solution are kept physically separated, allowing them to be characterized both concomitantly and individually without further separation processes. The ring&#8208;closing reaction using upconverted photons was quantified and compared to the efficiency of direct isomerization with ultraviolet light.

Square and planar, but novel and explosive: Cation&#8208;poor Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O forms transparent, dark orange crystals. The highly sensitive compound contains tetraazidoaurate(III) anions with a novel geometry and gold in square&#8208;planar coordination around nitrogen. Extensive vibrational spectroscopic investigations confirm both the anion geometry and the existence of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Transparent, dark orange Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O was synthesized by reaction of Ba(N3)2 and AuCl3 or HAuCl4 in aqueous solution. The novel barium tetraazidoaurate(III) tetrahydrate crystallizes in the monoclinic space group&#8197;Cc (no.&#8197;9) with a=1813.68(17)&#8197;pm, b=1737.95(11)&#8197;pm, c=682.04(8)&#8197;pm and &#946;=108.849(4)&#176;. The predominant structural features of Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O are two crystallographically independent discrete anions [Au(N3)4]&#8722; with gold in a tetragonal planar coordination by nitrogen. Vibrational spectra show good agreement with those of other azidoaurates(III). Upon drying, this salt was shown to be a highly explosive material.

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: From Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, user&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;efficient labeling strategies were developed for 17O&#8208;enrichment of free amino acids, Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids (produced on 1&#8197;g/day scale) and peptide side&#8208;chains (site&#8208;selective labeling). 17O&#8208;Labeled biomolecules were reproducibly obtained pure, in high synthetic yields (up to 85&#8201;%), and with high enrichment levels (&#8764;40&#8201;%).







Abstract
17O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of 17O (0.04&#8201;%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient 17O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides by using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to &#8764;40&#8201;%, yields &#8764;60&#8208;85&#8201;%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently, 17O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1&#8197;g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective 17O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with &#8764;28&#8201;% enrichment level. For all molecules, 17O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O (0.04&#8201;%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost-efficient &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O-enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides by using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to &#8764;40&#8201;%, yields &#8764;60-85&#8201;%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O-enriched Fmoc/&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu-protected amino acids were produced on a 1&#8197;g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site-selective &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O-labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side-chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with &#8764;28&#8201;% enrichment level. For all molecules, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Work with the elements of nature: Our building block, maytansinol, represented as a constellation of stars, is the main protagonist of the story. A ray of light coming out from it demonstrates how different moieties can be attached to it, opening new horizons. As maytansinoids show a destabilising effect on microtubules, we represent the latter by trees. The tree trunk is a microtubule, from which the tubulins are disassembling into the leaves. The TubInTrain logo in the corner represents the H2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;ITN&#8208;2019 network that made this interdisciplinary investigation possible. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pieraccini, D. Passarella and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203431). Created with BioRender.com.

         <title>Exciplex&#8208;forming Cohost Systems with 2,3&#8208;Dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based Acceptors to Achieve Efficient Near Infrared OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new 2,3&#8208;dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptors (A) p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4&#8208; and 3&#8208;benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex&#8208;forming blends were identified by the observation of the red&#8208;shifted emissions from various D:A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two&#8208;component relaxation processes observed by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex&#8208;forming blends. The device employing CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (2:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76% and 5.12%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629 nm and 618 nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32% and 5.57% with CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (4:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter BPBBT with photoluminescence (PL) lmax of 726 nm and a high PLQY of 67% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML gave an EQEmax of 5.02% and EL lmax centered at 735 nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to BPBBT and the corresponding device with CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML can achieve EL &#955;max of 743 nm and EQEmax of 4.79%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex&#8208;forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.</dc:description>

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in vivo&#160;and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, a series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives&#160;have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles.&#160;The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (upto 160 nm) and the emission (upto 260 nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs 4&#160;and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs&#160;5&#160;show strong absorption in the deep red to NIR (near&#8208;infrared) regions (595 &#8208; 684 nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650 &#8208; 715 nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY&#160;6a&#160;containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared.&#160;It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Most organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters do not show their RTP in solution. Here, we incorporated sulfur&#8208;containing thiophene bridges between the donor and acceptor moieties in D3A&#8208;type tristriazolotriazines (TTTs). The thiophene inclusion increased the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with the radiative T1&#8594;S0 pathway allows RTP to be observed in solution for all compounds, likely assisted by protection of the emissive TTT&#8208;thiophene core from the environment by the bulky peripheral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator &#960;&#8208;holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and ab initio computations. Of the four structures optimized in the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8208;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Intrinsically Disordered Regions in Transcription Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to&#160;alpha&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to&#160;a&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described in this article, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to&#160;tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3&#160;group.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from&#160;Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes, which operate at significantly lower redox potentials, have received little attention regarding their ability to participate in electrochemical catalysis. The bacterial tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum aromaticum (AOR) has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode to generate a functional system that can electrochemically oxidise a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of any of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient process</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Terephthalate Ligand Decorated TiO2 with Various Morphologies for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65% at 365 nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We communicate a feasibility study for high&#8208;resolution structural characterization of biomacromolecules in aqueous solution from X&#8208;ray scattering experiments measured over a range of scattering vectors (q) that is approximately two orders of magnitude wider than used previously for such systems. Scattering data with such an extended q&#8208;range enables the recovery of the underlying real&#8208;space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Quinoline N&#8208;oxides by Cathodic Reduction of Nitro Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple electrochemical reductive protocol was established for the direct formation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides with mild reaction conditions, in an undivided set&#8208;up, with a broad scope. The technical significance of this method could be demonstrated on a multigram scale.







Abstract
The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline N&#8208;oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent&#8208;free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set&#8208;up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 30 differently substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides was successfully performed in up to 90&#8201;% yield. Using CV studies, the mechanism of the selective formation of the quinoline N&#8208;oxides was elucidated. The technical relevance of the described reaction could be shown in a 50&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up reaction.

&lt;p&gt;The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent-free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set-up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 30 differently substituted quinoline &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides was successfully performed in up to 90&#8201;% yield. Using CV studies, the mechanism of the selective formation of the quinoline &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides was elucidated. The technical relevance of the described reaction could be shown in a 50-fold scale-up reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Get more from a larger pi: Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been synthesized and characterized. The positions and the additional fusion of benzene rings (colored in the figure) considerably changed the molecular structures, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the photoluminescence properties.







Abstract
Dibenzo[b,g]phosphindolizine oxide and three types of benzo[e]naphthophosphindolizine oxides have been synthesized by the ring&#8208;closing metathesis of benzo[b]phosphole oxide and naphthophosphole oxides with two olefin tethers. Their molecular structures and properties were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. The number and position of the benzene rings were found to alter the structural geometry and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and their effects were investigated by theoretical calculations. Among the phosphindolizine oxide derivatives investigated, only benzo[e]naphtho[2,3&#8208;b]phosphindolizine oxide with the naphthalene ring fused at 2,3&#8208;positions showed weak yellow fluorescence with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Stable Arylfluorene&#8208;Based Radical&#8208;Type Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophores with various electron densities have been investigated. The thermal stability and tolerance for peroxidation of the sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon radicals increased with decreasing electron density of the fluorene moiety. DFT calculations revealed that the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species are of crucial importance for the thermal stability and susceptibility toward peroxidation. A triazylfluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophore showed high stability toward oxidation and mechanochromic behavior when incorporated in polymer chains.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs) can undergo homolytic cleavage of their central C&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to mechanical forces, which affords radical species. Understanding the characteristics of these radical species allows bespoke mechanoresponsive materials to be designed and developed. The thermal stability of the central C&#8722;C bonds and the oxygen tolerance of the generated radical species are crucial characteristics that determine the functions and applicability of such RM&#8208;containing mechanoresponsive materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of two series of arylfluorene&#8208;based RM derivatives, that is, 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BPyF) and 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;triazyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BTAF). BPyF and BTAF derivatives were synthesized without generating any peroxides initially, albeit that BPyF slowly converted to the corresponding peroxide in solution. DFT calculations revealed the importance of the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species for their thermal stability and oxygen tolerance. Furthermore, the mechanochromism of BTAF was demonstrated by ball&#8208;milling a BTAF&#8208;centered polymer, which was synthesized by atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst
</title>

         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene exhibited high catalytic activity for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin under moderate condition without any additive.







Abstract
The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) were prepared through an immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, the high specific surface and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete, Homochiral FeII2L3 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination chemistry is a powerful method to synthesize supramolecular cages with distinct features that suit specific applications. This work demonstrates the synthesis of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages via chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, the installation of chirality&#8212;at both the vertices and ligand backbones&#8212;allows the formation of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages of different sizes via stereochemical control of the iron(II) centers. We observed that larger cages require multiple chiral centra (chiral ligands and vertices). In contrast, the formation of smaller cages is stereoselective with solely chiral ligands. The latter cages can also be formed from two chiral subcomponents, but only when they oppose matching chirality. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of these smaller FeII2L3 cages revealed several non&#8208;covalent interactions known as a driving force for narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. This expected behavior was confirmed utilizing the shorter ligands in racemic form, yielding discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages in enantiomeric pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Intermediates in the Reaction Pathway of SO2 on the CaO surface: From Physisorption to Sulfite to Sulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of CaO and Ca(OH)2 with solvated or gaseous SO2 plays a crucial role in the corrosion of urban infrastructure by acid rain or in the removal of SO2 from flue gas. We carried out a combined spectroscopic and theoretical investigation on the interaction of SO2 with a CaO(001) single crystal. First, the surface chemistry of SO2 was investigated at different temperatures using polarization&#8208;resolved IR reflection absorption spectroscopy. Three species were identified, and an in&#8208;depth density functional theory study was carried out, which allowed deriving a consistent picture. Unexpectedly, low temperature exposure to SO2 solely yields a physisorbed species. Only above 100 K, the transformation of this weakly bound adsorbate first to a chemisorbed sulfite and then to a sulfate occurs, effectively passivating the surface. Our results provide the basis for more efficient strategies in corrosion protection of urban infrastructure and in lime&#8208;based desulfurization of flue gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of the Structures and Magnetic Relaxation in Triangular Dy3 Complexes Based on a Tricompartmental Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a novel tricompartmental hydrazone ligand, a set of trinuclear Dy3 complexes has been isolated and structurally characterized. Complexes Dy3&#183;Cl, Dy3&#183;Br, and Dy3&#183;ClO4 feature a similar overall topology but different anions (Cl&#8210;, Br&#8210;, or ClO4&#8210;) in combination with exogenous OH&#8210; and solvent co&#8208;ligands, which is found to translate into very different magnetic properties. Complex Dy3&#183;Cl shows a double relaxation process with fast quantum tunneling of the magnetization, probably related to the structural disorder of &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8210; and &#956;2&#8208;Cl&#8210; co&#8208;ligands. Relaxation of the magnetization is slowed down for Dy3&#183;Br and Dy3&#183;ClO4, which do not show any structural disorder. In particular, fast quantum tunneling is suppressed in case of Dy3&#183;ClO4, resulting in an energy barrier of 341 K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5 K; this makes Dy3&#183;ClO4 one of the most robust air&#8208;stable trinuclear SMMs. Magneto&#8208;structural relationships of the three complexes are analyzed and rationalized with the help of CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands for Histological Multiplex Spectral Detection of Distinct Protein Aggregates in Alzheimer&#180;s Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the brain is the defining feature of many devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The development of fluorescent ligands that bind to these accumulations, or deposits, is essential for the characterization of these neuropathological lesions. We report the synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) thiophene&#8208;based ligands with different emission properties. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands displayed selectivity towards distinct disease&#8208;associated protein deposits in histological sections from postmortem brain tissue of individuals affected by Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). The ability of the ligands to selectively identify AD&#8208;associated pathological alterations, such as deposits composed of aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau, was reduced when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. When combining the D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands with conventional thiophene&#8208;based ligands, superior spectral separation of distinct protein aggregates in AD tissue sections was obtained. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species, as well as offer novel strategies for developing multiplex fluorescence detection of protein aggregates in tissue sections.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugating Coumarin with Tetraphenylethylene to Achieve Dual&#8208;State Emission for Reversible Mechanofluorochromism and Live Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;state emission luminogens (DSEgens) are receiving research interest in the construction of multifunctional materials due to their inherent advantage of high emission efficiency in both the molecularly dispersed solution state and the solid state. However, it remains challenging in synthesizing DSEgens via a delicate manipulation of the molecular structures. This work presents an example of synthesizing bright DSEgens by tuning the molecular electronic structures and conformations. Three coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with a donor&#8208;acceptor electronic structure and highly twisting conformations have been synthesized. While compound resulting from direct conjugation of coumarin with a TPE unit shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission, compound with an N,N&#8208;diaminoethyl modification on the 7&#8208;position of coumarin and compound with a further phenyl linker between coumarin and TPE units feature strong dual&#8208;state emission. Benefiting from their strong solid emission and twisting conformation, these fluorophores display reversible mechanofluorochromism. Finally, applications for rewritable information storage in the solid state and live&#8208;cell imaging in the solution state were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>{V6} Ring Sandwiched Polyoxoniobate as Molecular Electrocatalyst for Oxidant&#8208;Free Synthesis of Sulfoxides Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules to value&#8208;added chemicals has attracted recent attention. Although a series of transition metal based electrocatalytic materials have been developed, the lack of precise structure information generates great challenges in understanding the catalytic mechanism at a molecular level. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a molecular electrocatalyst, Na2K6H14[(VO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#183;31H2O&#183;2.5C2H8N2 (abbreviated as V6(TeNb9)2), where a reduced {V6} ring is sandwiched by two trivacant Keggin&#8208;type {&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33}. V6(TeNb9)2 as heterogeneous electrocatalyst can selectively convert 95% of thioanisole to sulfoxide with the Faraday efficiency up to 98%. Notably, the important role of the embedded {V6} ring in the electrocatalytic oxidation was illustrated by comparing with {Nb6} ring sandwiched catalyst, Na5K7H4[(NbO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#183;17H2O (abbreviated as Nb6(TeNb9)2). Mechanism studies reveal that during the electrocatalytic oxidation process water is the only oxygen source and a key intermediate PhCH3S+&#8226; is involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dione: A Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Unit with Organic Semiconductor Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of p&#8208;conjugated systems. Although double fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been utilized as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein on the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and prepared D&#8208;A&#8208;D p&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels compared to those of the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Responsive Molecular Receptor to Modulate Atropisomerism and Cation Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable anthranyl receptors controlled by 1O2 show a different preorganization of the binding sites induced by two combined effects: the structural modification and the on/off mode for the host atropisomerism.







Abstract
In switchable molecular recognition, 1O2 stimulus responsive receptors offer a unique structural change that is rarely exploited. The employed [4+2] reaction between 1O2 and anthracene derivatives is quantitative, reversible and easily implemented. To evaluate the full potential of this new stimulus, a non&#8208;macrocyclic anthracene&#8208;based host was designed for the modular binding of cations. The structural investigation showed that 1O2 controlled the atropisomerism in an on/off fashion within the pair of hosts. The binding studies revealed higher association constants for the endoperoxide receptor compared to the parent anthracene, due to a more favoured preorganization of the recognition site. The fatigue of the 1O2 switchable hosts and their complexes was monitored over five cycles of cycloaddition/cycloreversion.

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;Type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations revealed that the distal methyl group controls both concertedness and energy barrier during the skeletal rearrangement reaction involved in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the unique skeletal rearrangement&#8216;s protonation process, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity were elucidated.







Abstract
Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, this skeletal rearrangement reaction was investigated using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8722;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF Based Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for the Detection of Potential COVID&#8208;19 Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence detection is a fast and convenient method to quantify and control the drug amount in body fluids. Here, we present a new mixed lanthanide&#8208;based MOF that can selectively distinguish and monitor the amount of favipiravir among other potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs.







Abstract
Countless people have been affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, attracting scientists&#8217; attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious side effects, requiring real&#8208;time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal conditions from either Eu (Eu&#8208;MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb&#8208;MOF or (2)) using the highly delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L=5&#8208;(4&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable luminescent EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv=1&#215;107 [M&#8722;1], detection limit is 4.63&#8197;nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID&#8208;19 drug candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing, MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and recycled 5 times.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic CRRiteria: This review summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). It provides advanced knowledge on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR, serving as a general guide to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.







Abstract
Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward improving semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Unveiling the Collaborative Effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;MoS2 Hybrid Interface for Electrochemical Melatonin Determination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption geometry of cucurbit[8]uril on a 2D nanoplatform controls the recognition capabilities. It behaves like a traffic light: on a transition metal dichalcogenide, the reception portals of CB[8] are open and the guest molecule can fit in. On graphene (or carbonaceous termination) they are closed, which prevents complex formation.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. Particularly well known is the ability of cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[n] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host&#8208;guest recognition between the MoS2&#8208;CB[8] hybrid interface and melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We find that CB[8] on MoS2 organizes the receptor portals perpendicularly to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro&#8208;oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.

     alt="Unveiling the Collaborative Effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril-MoS2 Hybrid Interface for Electrochemical Melatonin Determination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The adsorption geometry of cucurbit[8]uril&lt;/b&gt; on a 2D nanoplatform controls the recognition capabilities. It behaves like a traffic light: on a transition metal dichalcogenide, the reception portals of CB[8] are open and the guest molecule can fit in. On graphene (or carbonaceous termination) they are closed, which prevents complex formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host-guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. Particularly well known is the ability of cucurbit[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]urils (CB[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host-guest recognition between the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CB[8] hybrid interface and melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We find that CB[8] on MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; organizes the receptor portals perpendicularly to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro-oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled enzyme mimic. Calix[4]arenes, provided with long alkyl chains and guanidine units, perform spontaneous aggregation driven by hydrophobic effect. A pronounced superiority of the phosphodiesterase activity of the assembled structures compared with the monomers indicates intermolecular cooperation of the active units through a dynamic preorganization.







Abstract
The calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic effect, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering. The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favors phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.

         <title>Access to Amide&#8208;linked Organic Cages by in situ Trapping of Metastable Imine Assemblies: Solution Phase Bisamine Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular cages are sought after as receptors and catalysts. However, typical dynamic covalent chemistry approaches restrict the shape&#8208;persistence, solubility and stability of self&#8208;assembled organic cages. As a result, organic cages occupy a narrow chemical and functional space, and solution&#8208;phase applications and studies remain rare. We report an in situ trapping protocol, using Pinnick oxidation conditions, to convert soluble metastable imine assemblies to robust amide cages, and exemplify the method to access previously inaccessible organic cages. The new cages are internally functionalised with two constrained and diametrically opposed carboxylic acid groups that can distinguish between functionalised piperazines in THF. We anticipate our approach will broaden access to robust, soluble, self&#8208;assembled organic cages of an unsymmetrical or semi&#8208;flexible nature, which in turn will drive advances in solution&#8208;phase applications of molecular cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the rapid growth of electrophotocatalysis in recent years, enantioselective catalytic reactions powered by this unique methodology remain rare. In this work, we report an electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for direct asymmetric decarboxylative cyanation of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The synergistic merging of electrophotochemical cerium catalysis and asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis permits mild reaction conditions for the formation and utilization of the key carbon centered radicals by combining the power of light and electrical energy. Electrophotochemical cerium catalysis enables radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis for the construction of C&#8211;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective fashion. This environmentally benign method smoothly converts a diverse array of arylacetic acids into the corresponding alkyl nitriles in good yields and enantioselectivities without using chemical oxidants or pre&#8208;functionalization of the acid substrates and can be readily scaled up.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;promoted Carbon&#8208;silicon Solid Acid Catalysts for the Synthesis and Process Optimization of Benzaldehyde Glycol Acetal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of transition metal (M)&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8208;M&#8208;Si; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr) solid acid catalysts with designated molar ratio of M/Si = 1:8 were fabricated and exploited for acetalization of benzaldehyde (BzH) with ethylene glycol (EG). The physical and chemical properties of these C&#8208;M&#8208;Si catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;gel method were characterized by various techniques, namely, SEM, EDS, TGA&#8208;DTG, BET, XRD, FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and NH3&#8208;TPD. Among various examined acidic C&#8208;M&#8208;Si catalysts, the C&#8208;Fe&#8208;Si catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with the benzaldehyde glycol acetal (BEGA) yield of 97.67%, in excellent agreement with the value (97.88%) predicted by the response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box&#8208;Behnken design (BBD). C&#8208;Fe&#8208;Si catalyst with the high catalytic activities and excellent stability and reusability may be ascribed to the suitable acidity and uniform surface distribution of active sites requisite for the acid&#8208;catalyzed acetalization reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochromic systems capable of switching near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are fascinating from the viewpoint of applications in the materials and life sciences. Although 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethanes (AQDs) with a folded form undergo one&#8208;stage two&#8208;electron oxidation to produce twisted dicationic dyes exhibiting NIR absorption, there is a need to establish a design strategy that can enhance the NIR&#8208;absorbing abilities of the corresponding dicationic dyes. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of anthraquinodimethane derivatives with various substituents introduced at the ortho&#8208;position(s) of the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl group. X&#8208;ray and spectroscopic analyses revealed that NIR&#8208;absorbing properties can be changed by introduction of the ortho substituents. Thus, control of the steric and electronic effects of the ortho substituents on the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning of the HOMO and LUMO levels for neutral AQDs and twisted dications, respectively, resulting in the modification of electrochemical and spectroscopic properties under an &#8220;ortho&#8208;substitution strategy&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The article dealt with the ruthenium complexes of redox active azo appended modified lawsone L1&#8722; (HL1: (E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyldiazenyl)naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione))/L2&#8722; (HL2:5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;p&#8208;tolylazobenzo[a]phenazine) derived [RuIII(acac)2(L1&#8722;)]/ [RuIII(acac)2(L2&#8722;)] 1/5, [RuII(bpy)2(L1&#8722;)]ClO4/[RuII(bpy)2(L2&#8722;)]ClO4 [2]ClO4/[6]ClO4, ctc&#8208;[RuII(pap)2(L1&#8722;)]ClO4/ctc&#8208;[RuII(pap)2(L2&#8722;)]ClO4 [3]ClO4/[7]ClO4 and [RuII(CO)(H)(PPh3)2 (L1&#8722;)]/[RuII(CO)(Cl)(PPh3)2(L2&#8722;)] 4/8 (acac= acetylacetonate, bpy= 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, pap=2&#8208;phenylazopyridine). The ligands L1&#8722; and L2&#8722; differed with respect to the para&#8208;quinone versus phenazine moieties linked to the azo function.

The involvement of selective redox center(s) towards the accessible redox steps of the complexes encompassing multiple redox active entities i.e. Ru, phenolate (L1&#8722;/L2&#8722;), para&#8208;quinone (L1&#8722;), phenazine (L2&#8722;), azo (L1&#8722;/L2&#8722;, pap), diimine (bpy) was analyzed. It revealed that under the prevailing competitive scenario oxidation was mostly dominated by the phenolate group of L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; (phenolate&#8594;phenoxide), while successive reductions were taken place either at the para&#8208;quinone/phenazine units of L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; or azo/diimine functions of pap/bpy. Though the azo function of pap in 3+/7+ underwent facile reduction, the same azo function associated with L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; conspicuously remained unreduced in all occasions. The FMO analysis revealed that the propensity of pap for the azo reduction with special reference to that in L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; could be correlated with its relatively lower energy &#960;* orbital (LUMO). Complexes displayed intense LMCT (1/5) and bpy (2+/6+), pap (3+/7+), L (4/8) targeted MLCT transitions in the visible region.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5 eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1 s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.</dc:description>

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Moisture&#8208;stable Zinc(II) Carbene Dithiolate Dimer Showing Fast Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#160;and Dexter Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimeric ZnII carbene complex featuring bridging and chelating benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolate ligands is highly stable towards air and water. The donor&#8208;Zn&#8208;acceptor structure leads to visible light emission in the solid state, solution and polymer matrices with &#955;max between 577&#8208;657 nm and, for zinc(II) complexes, unusually high radiative rate constants for triplet exciton decay of up to kr = 1.5&#215;105 s&#8208;1 at room temperature. Variable temperature and DFT/MRCI studies show that a small energy gap between the 1/3LL/LMCT states of only 79 meV is responsible for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Time&#8208;resolved luminescence and transient absorption studies confirm the occurrence of long&#8208;lived, dominantly ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states in solution, allowing for application in Dexter energy transfer photocatalysis.</dc:description>

The cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy as a new emerging frontier has attracted significant attention for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Its advantages are summarized with special emphasis on altering the electronic structure and charge distribution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. This Concept also reviews its application for the oxygen reduction reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and Zn air batteries, and also proposes future opportunities.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Dynamic Interactions Between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic pathway of triarylmethane dye Brilliant Green (BG) through the antimicrobial target MscL protein. Key residues (especially F23 and I27) and the specific processes that act on BG through the Ma&#8208;MscL channel are identified, and proof is presented that BG activates the hydrophobic gate of Ma&#8208;MscL by its bound water molecules.







Abstract
The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeted MscL. However, the detailed binding sites to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL were investigated using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel were identified by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, it was demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL can be developed.

Photoredox&#8208;mediate deoxygenation: In this work, we explore an efficient, general photoredox&#8208;mediated deoxygenated approach of abundant, simple, and commercially available carboxylic acids and vinyl boronic esters, which form the important &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;borylalkanes. Additionally, a protocol of the late&#8208;stage functionalization of naturally occurring bioactive carboxylic acids and drugs has been developed using this approach.







Abstract
A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem&#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8722;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh3. It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, for example, gem&#8208;(Ar, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes, and gem&#8208;(Alkyl, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size selectivity in the coordination of different lanthanides ions to the two donor sites of the ditopic pyterpyNO ligand has been evidenced in heteronuclear complexes of formula RE2RE*2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2, where smaller (larger) ions normally display a higher affinity for the eight (nine)&#8208;coordinated oxygen (nitrogen) site. The present results, obtained in solution and in the solid state with a multi&#8208;technique approach (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 19F&#8197;NMR, magnetometry and photoluminescence), are independent of the employed synthetic route.







Abstract
The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine N&#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE2(tta)6(pyterpyNO)2 (where RE=Y, (1); Eu, (2), Dy, (3) Htta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)3dme (dme=dimethoxyethane) yielded Y2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (4), Dy2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (5) and Eu2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (6). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that 4, 5 and 6 are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the O&#8208;donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through 19F&#8197;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91&#8201;% selectivity for 4. Furthermore, 19F&#8197;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu2Y2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (7), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the roundabout of four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three DNA half&#8208;turns, four types of tiles were designed with helper strands traveling via right turn, left turn, bridged longitudinal weaving, or U&#8208;turn for construction of 2D DNA nanostructures. Especially, the one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin labelling techniques were applied to judge the chirality of E&#8208;tiling tubes.







Abstract
By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labelling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.

         <title>Divergent Copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and N&#8208;Fluorobenzene Sulfonimide: Access to the 1,3&#8208;Haloamines and Aminoindanes</title>

A method for divergent copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening 1,3&#8208;bifunctionalization reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes was developed; 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation and 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation products were generated in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and N&#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX2 (X=Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent formal umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclization of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Type&#8208;1&#8201;iodothyronine deiodinase, which promotes the deiodination of iodine atoms on the outer and inner rings of thyroxine, was successfully modeled using a peptide&#8208;based selenocompound. Kinetic analyses of this reaction suggested that highly conserved His and Cys residues at the active site crucially act as general acid catalysts together with the selenocysteine redox center.







Abstract
Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8208;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8208;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8208;Se (or Se&#8208;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8208;I bond in the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.

         <title>Reactivity of E4 (E4=P4, As4, AsP3) towards Low&#8208;Valent Al(I) and Ga(I) Compounds</title>

Bond by bond. The conversion of yellow arsenic with the group 13 metal compound [LGa] (L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) leads to one As&#8722;As bond cleavage in [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;As4)]. By reacting this product with an unsaturated metal complex, two further As&#8722;As bonds are broken, to form a butadiene&#8208;like As4 chain stabilized in the coordination sphere of transition metals as well as main group metals.







Abstract
The reactivity of yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 towards low&#8208;valent group 13 compounds was investigated. The reactions of [LAl] (1, L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) with As4 and AsP3 lead to [(LAl)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (3&#8201;b), AsP3 (3&#8201;c)) by insertion of two fragments [LAl] into two of the six E&#8722;E edges of the E4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, the reaction of [LGa] (2) with E4 afforded [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (4&#8201;b), AsP3 (4&#8201;c)). In these compounds, only one E&#8722;E bond of the E4 tetrahedra was cleaved. These compounds represent the first examples of the conversion of yellow arsenic and AsP3, respectively, with group 13 compounds. Furthermore, the reactivity of the gallium complexes towards unsaturated transition metal units or polypnictogen (En) ligand complexes was investigated. This leads to the heterobimetallic compounds [(LGa)(&#956;,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)(LNi)] (5&#8201;a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;E4)(LGa)] (E=P (6&#8201;a), As (6&#8201;b), Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#951;3:1:1&#8208;E3)(LGa)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), which combine two different ligand systems in one complex (nacnac and Cp) as well as two different types of metals (main group and transition metals). The products were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multisubstituted allenylboronates were easily accessed through iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates. The reaction is highly efficient, occurs under mild conditions, and is easy to scale up. The reaction is stereospecific and occurs with anti&#8208;SN2&#8216; displacement of the acetate by boron, which allows a transfer of chirality. Several transformations including propargylation and further additions highlight the synthetic utility of this reaction.







Abstract
A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates has been developed. The method allows the preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereochemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs; this also allows transfer of chirality to yield enantiomerically enriched allenylboronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol was further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction was followed under a variety of conditions using NMR spectroscopy. Several mechanistic models were evaluated by considering multiple experiments simultaneously. Surprisingly, only a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step described well all the data. The CA&#8208;RE reaction is hence an autocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &#8220;click-like&#8221; [2+2] cycloaddition&lt;/b&gt; - retro-electrocyclization (&lt;i&gt;CA&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;) reaction was followed under a variety of conditions using NMR spectroscopy. Several mechanistic models were evaluated by considering multiple experiments simultaneously. Surprisingly, only a model in which the final 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene product promoted the first step described well all the data. The &lt;i&gt;CA-RE&lt;/i&gt; reaction is hence an autocatalytic reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [2+2] cycloaddition - retro-electrocyclization (&lt;i&gt;CA&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;) reaction is a &#8220;click-like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor-acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non-concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro-electrocyclization step, simple first-order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Photoswitchable mesogens: A series of reversibly photoswitchable C3&#8208;symmetric discotic liquid crystals have been made using a threefold phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole tethered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core. In a discotic nematic organization, they exhibit high thermal stability of metastable states, excellent reversibility in photoswitching, and robust light&#8208;controlled mesomorphological changes.







Abstract
Three benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core&#8208;based molecular systems appended with phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole photoswitches at the peripheral position through variable&#8208;length alkoxy chains have been designed and synthesized. The supramolecular interactions of the mesogens provided discotic nematic liquid crystalline assembly as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Spectroscopic studies confirmed the reversible photoswitching and excellent thermal stability of the photoswitched states in solution phase and thin film. Also, atomic force microscopic (AFM) and POM investigations demonstrated the morphological changes in the self&#8208;assembly induced by the photoirradiation as monitored by the changes in the height profiles and optical appearance of the textures, respectively. Remarkably, the liquid crystalline discotic molecules showed reversible &#8220;on and off states&#8221; controlled by light at ambient temperature.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of carba&#8208;sugars with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position has been synthesized. Key steps were a ring&#8208;closing metathesis and a hydroboration. The compounds have been tested for their ability to induce self&#8208;cleavage of the glmS ribozyme, which represents a potential drug target to fight bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Compound 32, with a methoxy substituent at the carba position, turned out to have the most promising properties.







Abstract
Riboswitches are 5&#8217;&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistance against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we showed that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to that of GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand design has a strong impact on the surface activity of organometallic complexes. Complementing the ligand system of a Pt complex with fluorinated groups triggers strong enrichment at the IL/vacuum interface in IL solution in a buoy&#8208;like fashion, which was studied by ARXPS.







Abstract
The targeted enrichment of a Pt complex with an ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;derived ligand system in IL solution is demonstrated by using angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the ligand system is complemented with fluorinated side chains, the complex accumulates strongly at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5 to 30&#8201;%mol. The surface enrichment was found to be most efficient at the lowest concentration, which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;phase (SILP) catalysis.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>

Small&#8208;molecule probe derived from norathyriol with a dual function of miRNA inhibition and target identification was developed. In combination with bioorthogonal click chemistry, we identified AGO2 as the target of this probe.







Abstract
By virtue of their key roles in pathologies, miRNAs represent a promising class of therapeutic targets. While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified via high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1&#8201;a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1&#8201;a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1&#8201;a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1&#8201;a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(dicyanomethid)cyclopropenium&#8208;based &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; carbene ligand stabilizes a neutral nitrogen radical. The latter is characterized via EPR measurements in solution and X&#8208;ray structural analyses in the solid state. Both indicate that the radical is in equilibrium with aggregates and a &#963;&#8208;bound dimer.







Abstract
Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species. Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylene)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).

         <title>Characterization of the glmS Ribozymes from Listeria Monocytogenes and Clostridium Difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>

The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes stringently discriminates between co&#8208;factors and retains cleavage activity at low temperatures, illustrating unique characteristics of individual glmS ribozymes.







Abstract
The glmS ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt;450 variants of the glmS ribozyme were identified by in silico approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the glmS ribozymes of the human pathogens Clostridium difficile and Listeria monocytogenes. Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC50 values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for glmS ribozymes from other bacteria. The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the glmS ribozyme of C. difficile retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved, glmS ribozymes have unique characteristics.

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) linkers triggered by a click reaction with tetrazines has enabled new concepts in chemical biology and in vivo chemistry. We introduce a new dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) with high stability and reduced lipophilicity that can be prepared in five steps and demonstrate its application in bioorthogonal prodrug activation, achieving a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in&#8197;vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multilayered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only five steps by applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated by in&#8208;situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a small number of consecutive metal&#8208;mediated base pairs in a DNA duplex, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal of a chiral metal&#8208;mediated base pair is determined by the intrinsic helical chirality of the duplex. With an increasing number of adjacent metal&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal can topple so that the intrinsically preferred isomer is adopted.







Abstract
When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P (P, 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive P&#8201;:&#8201;P pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P pairs, irrespective of whether (S)&#8208;P or (R)&#8208;P is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (S)&#8208;P but not for (R)&#8208;P. This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.

Insertion of cAACMe into E&#8722;H bonds of EH2R2 (E=Ge, R=Mes; E=Sn, R=Me) to yield cAACMeH&#8722;EHR2 and the dehydrogenative coupling of EH2R2 using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes are reported.







Abstract
A study of the reactivity of several N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (cAACMe) with the group 14 hydrides GeH2Mes2 and SnH2Me2 (Me=CH3, Mes=1,3,5&#8208;(CH3)3C6H2) is presented. The reaction of GeH2Mes2 with cAACMe led to the insertion of cAACMe into one Ge&#8722;H bond to give cAACMeH&#8722;GeHMes2 (1). If 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2ImMe) was used as the carbene, NHC&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative coupling occurred, which led to the NHC&#8208;stabilized germylene Me2ImMe&#8901;GeMes2 (2). The reaction of SnH2Me2 with cAACMe also afforded the insertion product cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3), and reaction of two equivalents Me2ImMe with SnH2Me2 gave the NHC&#8208;stabilized stannylene Me2ImMe&#8901;SnMe2 (4). If the sterically more demanding NHCs Me2ImMe, 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (iPr2ImMe) and 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Dipp2Im) were employed, selective formation of cyclic oligomers (SnMe2)n (5; n=5&#8211;8) in high yield was observed. These cyclic oligomers were also obtained from the controlled decomposition of cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3).

         <title>Organophotocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Deficient Styrenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2] cycloaddition of alkenes is a powerful method of preparing cyclobutanes, but the use of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes has been largely neglected so far. By using the organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated procedure to cyclobutane motifs bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents has been developed. Homodimerisations as well as intramolecular reactions to fused bicyclic motifs can be performed in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated, and both homodimerisations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available by using this methodology.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 3, January 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dirhodium(II)/Xantphos catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted anilines, &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, and allylic compounds was developed, affording various aniline derivatives with diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields under mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via para C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives by Rh(II)&#8208;carbenoid intermediate, and subsequent [Rh2]/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation of the resulting &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate intermediate.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]2/Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two new self&#8208;assembled 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ cages featuring a hydrophobic cavity able to encapsulate the anticancer drug cisplatin is reported, enabling biodistribution studies by positron emission tomography (PET) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
To advance the design of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular architectures as new generation theranostic agents, the synthesis of 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ metallacages is reported. Different spectroscopic and bio&#8208;analytical methods support the formation of the host&#8208;guest cage&#8208;cisplatin complex. The biodistribution profiles of one of the cages, alone or encapsulating cisplatin have been studied by PET/CT imaging in healthy mice in&#8197;vivo, in combination to ICP&#8208;MS ex vivo.

Fluorinated side chains of a functionalized Pt complex in an ionic liquid act as buoys, leading to pronounced enrichment of the complex at the IL/gas interface, as is evidenced by strongly enhanced Pt signals in angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. For complexes without these side chains no such effect is observed. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;P.&#8197;Steinr&#252;ck and co&#8208;workers.

High energy density and long lifespan sodium metal batteries. In this review, recent progress in high energy density and long lifespan SMBs is summarized from the aspects of modification of the sodium metal anode, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. In addition, some insights toward their practical applications are introduced.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to their relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for their commercialization. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in SMBs in terms of sodium anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs are summarized. In addition, insertion&#8208; and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials are introduced. Finally, an outlook for the future of practical SMBs is provided.

Metallic catalysts in the CO2&#8722;ODP reaction are summarized in detail in view of various aspects such as the type of materials, catalyst design concepts, reaction mechanisms, and the role of CO2.







Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 (CO2&#8722;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO2 usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO2&#8722;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO2&#8722;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO2.

         <title>Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Structures and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply HOF! This work reviewed the recent development progress of hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), including ionic HOFs and metallized HOFs. The rational design synthesis principles of stable, porous, and functional hybrid HOFs by using charged or metallized building blocks are discussed. Their front applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, and catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
As a new class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from building blocks by hydrogen bonds have gained increasing attention. HOFs benefit from advantages including mild synthesis, easy purification, and good recyclability. However, some HOFs transform into unstable frameworks after desolvation, which hinders their further applications. Nowadays, the main challenges of developing HOFs lie in stability improvement, porosity establishment, and functionalization. Recently, more and more stable and permanently porous HOFs have been reported. Of all these design strategies, stronger charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds have been proven to be effective for developing stable, porous, and functional solids called hybrid HOFs, including ionic and metallized HOFs. This Review discusses the rational design synthesis principles of hybrid HOFs and their cutting&#8208;edge applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, catalysis and so forth.

         <title>Clearing an ESKAPE Pathogen in a Model Organism; A Polypyridyl Ruthenium(II) Complex Theranostic that Treats a Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection in Galleria mellonella</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear polypyridyl RuII complex is highly active against the ESKAPE pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With a single dose it can be used to both directly monitor, and completely clear, infections caused by an AMR strain of A baumannii that proves to be highly virulent in the Galleria mellonella larva model when left untreated.







Abstract
In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_ 007_ IMP and PA_ 004_ CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller&#8208;Hinton&#8208;II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem&#8208;resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80&#8197;mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be&#8805;105 for AB184 and&#8805;103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96&#8197;h. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Clickable Unnatural Sugars in the Unprotected and 1,6&#8208;Di&#8208;O&#8208;Acylated Forms for Metabolic Glycan Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural sugars have been widely used in metabolic glycan labeling (MGL), but they can induce non&#8208;enzymatic S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Here we develop facile synthetic routes for unprotected clickable unnatural sugars and their 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated counterparts at the ten&#8208;gram scale, the latter enables MGL with high efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification







Abstract
Clickable unnatural sugars have been widely used in studying glycosylation in living systems via the metabolic glycan labelling (MGL) strategy. Partial protection of unnatural sugars by 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylation increases the labelling efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of clickable unnatural sugars in both the unprotected and 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated forms at the ten&#8208;gram scale. By evaluation of the labelling specificity, efficiency, and biocompatibility of various 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated sugars for MGL in cell lines and living mice, we demonstrate that 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;propionylated unnatural sugars are optimal chemical reporters for glycan labelling. The synthetic routes developed in this work should facilitate the widespread use of MGL with no artificial S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification for investigating the functional roles of glycans.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making a link: C&#8208;Terminal myristoylation of fusion peptide restores the fusion&#8208;catalytic role of fusion peptide (FP). The lipid linker might restrict the localization of the C&#8197;terminus of the FP at the interface, assist the free dive of the N&#8197;terminus of the fusion peptide to the membrane, and bridge the viral membrane and host membrane through plasticity to promote the fusion.







Abstract
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.

The C-terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>

Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene is used as a functional scaffold to engineer a molecular semiconductor, the properties of which can be tailored by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Oxidation with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation yields sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence complexes.







Abstract
Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00=2.99&#8197;eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8722;1&#8211;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;2&#8211;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first S&#8208;doped mid&#8208;emitting PAH&#8208;based LECs.

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of two conformers with &#8220;compact&#8221; and &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of Cu4I4 demonstrating green and red emissions was established for the octahedral L2Cu4I4 complex with the conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand. Stretching of the Cu4I4 core provides the drastic change of the emission and might be a reason for the dual emission of the Cu4I4 octahedral complexes.







Abstract
A conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.

         <title>Facile Formation of Stable Neutral Radicals and Cations from [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin was synthesized in 63&#8201;% yield by TsOH&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromotripyrrin. Treatment of [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA gave a stable neutral radical, which was oxidized to stable [20]smaragdyrin antiaromatic cationwith AgSbF6. Reduction of the neutral radical with NaBH4 gave aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was readily oxidized to the neutral radical and converted to thermodynamically stable [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Similarly, [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was oxidized to stable neutral radical and antiaromatic cation in a stepwise manner. As such, smaragdyrin BF2 complexes have been shown to be very intriguing, allowing for various electronic states including stable radicals and cations.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin freebase was synthesized by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromodipyrrin in an improved yield of 63&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, treatment of the [20]smaragdyrin freebase with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and triethylamine (TEA) gave a stable radical species, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the tripyrrin site, probably by ready release of a hydrogen atom of a [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex. Similar treatment of [22]smaragdyrin free base produced another [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the dipyrrin site. The tripyrrin site coordinated neutral radical was oxidized with AgSbF6 to give a stable antiaromatic cation; this was reduced with NaBH4 to its 22&#960; congener, which was easily oxidized back to the neutral radical in the air and rearranged to thermodynamically stable dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Further, the dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was similarly oxidized to a stable neutral radical and a stable cation in a stepwise manner. This work demonstrates a rare ability of smaragdyrin BF2 complexes to exist in multiple redox states, particularly forming a stable neutral radical by facile release of a hydrogen atom.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding of an NIR Emitting Osmium Polypyridyl Probe Revealed by Solution NMR and Time&#8208;Resolved Infrared Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent enhancement of an enantiopure Os polypyridyl probe containing an extended dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) ligand in the presence of human telomer (hTel) and cMYC guanine quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) is reported. NMR studies indicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet end, which is supported by time&#8208;resolved infrared measurements. Importantly, the combined measurements indicate the sensitivity of luminescent enhancement to the particular orientation at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet binding site.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)2(dppz)]2+ complex to different G&#8208;quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex.

     alt="G-Quadruplex Binding of an NIR Emitting Osmium Polypyridyl Probe Revealed by Solution NMR and Time-Resolved Infrared Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luminescent enhancement&lt;/b&gt; of an enantiopure Os polypyridyl probe containing an extended dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-c]phenazine (dppz) ligand in the presence of human telomer (hTel) and cMYC guanine quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) is reported. NMR studies indicate the role of &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions at the 5&#8217;-quartet end, which is supported by time-resolved infrared measurements. Importantly, the combined measurements indicate the sensitivity of luminescent enhancement to the particular orientation at the 5&#8217;-quartet binding site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G-quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dppz)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex to different G-quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time-resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex. Similar behaviour is also observed for the related complex [Os(TAP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dppp2)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; upon quadruplex binding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Photochemical Reaction Kinetics in Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organic molecular crystals, many photoreactions do not obey simple kinetic models, but instead follow nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics. This kind of reaction is often called a cooperative reaction because the reaction of an individual molecule is facilitated (or inhibited) by its neighbors.







Abstract
Photoreactive molecular crystals have been intensively investigated as next&#8208;generation functional materials. Changes in physicochemical properties are usually interpreted in terms of static pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction molecular structures and packings determined by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. However, to elucidate the dynamic properties, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photochemical kinetics in crystals. Reaction dynamics in the crystal phase can be dramatically different from those in dilute solution because the local molecular environment evolves as the surrounding reactant molecules are transformed into products. In this Review article, we summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior. We also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior. This Review article should help provide a foundation for future workers to understand and analyze photochemical reaction kinetics in crystals.

         <title>Gated, Selective Anion Exchange in Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. The external groups act as a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing ligand rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate. Bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.







Abstract
Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.

         <title>N&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Morpholinos &#8211; a New Class of Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholino nucleoside derivatives is reported. The procedures were based either on a double reductive amination&#8208;cyclisation reaction, using commercially available mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoralkylated amines, or on post&#8208;cyclisation trifluoromethylation of the morpholino nitrogen, by oxidative desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with NBS and diethylaminosulfur trifluoride.







Abstract
The first concise and efficient synthesis of some fluorine&#8208;containing morpholino nucleosides has been developed. One synthetic strategy was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of the vicinal diol unit of uridine, cytidine adenosine and guanosine derivatives, followed by cyclisation of the dialdehyde intermediates by double reductive amination with fluorinated primary amines to obtain various N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholinos. Another approach involved cyclisation of the diformyl intermediates with ammonia source, followed by dithiocarbamate formation and desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride yielding the corresponding morpholine&#8208;based nucleoside analogues with a N&#8208;CF3 element in their structure.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic monomer, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core flanked by two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) tails. The CSO molecule can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in water with blue fluorescence and LCST behavior. These nanoassemblies also exhibit thermo&#8208;responsive fluorescence and were further used to construct a responsive light harvesting system.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. This study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking photosynthesis in nature.

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living systems utilize energy with a high efficiency, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our detection based on an AuNP&#8208;modulated qPCR system shows that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by the hydrolysis of dNTP (an energy&#8208;storing molecule like ATP), which efficiently drives DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel method for detecting MIR photons, and pave a way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the high&#8208;efficiency energy utilization of biology.







Abstract
Living systems can utilize energy with a high efficiency. Biophotons are proposed to modulate biological functions with such efficiency; however, the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, especially due to the challenge of ultraweak mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) light detection and the theoretical perturbation from spontaneous MIR emission. Here, we proposed an optimized system to detect MIR biophotons generated in the hydrolysis of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, energy&#8208;storing molecules similar to ATP). The system used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that was modulated by gold nanoparticle (AuNP) concentration and thus by the inter&#8208;AuNP distance, which depends on the concentration above. The measurements indicate that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by dNTP hydrolysis, which can drive DNA replication.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Living systems utilize energy with a high efficiency&lt;/b&gt;, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our detection based on an AuNP-modulated qPCR system shows that 33- and 84-THz photons are released by the hydrolysis of dNTP (an energy-storing molecule like ATP), which efficiently drives DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel method for detecting MIR photons, and pave a way for photon-based insights to understand the high-efficiency energy utilization of biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living systems can utilize energy with a high efficiency. Biophotons are proposed to modulate biological functions with such efficiency; however, the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, especially due to the challenge of ultraweak mid-infrared (MIR) light detection and the theoretical perturbation from spontaneous MIR emission. Here, we proposed an optimized system to detect MIR biophotons generated in the hydrolysis of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, energy-storing molecules similar to ATP). The system used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that was modulated by gold nanoparticle (AuNP) concentration and thus by the inter-AuNP distance, which depends on the concentration above. The measurements indicate that 33- and 84-THz photons are released by dNTP hydrolysis, which can drive DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel chain-reaction-based method for detecting MIR photons in solution, and pave a way for photon-based insights to understand the highly efficient energy utilization of biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromaticity of charged expanded porphyrins turns out to be much more complex to study than that of their planar neutral analogues. In particular, identifying the most conjugated circuit is no longer straightforward. In addition to planarity, the protonation and deprotonation of porphyrinoids play an important role in determining their aromaticity. We have demonstrated that the largest charged porphyrins do not present a clear main conjugation pathway. Among the preferred aromatic indices, AVmin ends up being the most useful tool for recognizing the most aromatic path. We can relate the difficulty of finding the most conjugated path of a porphyrin to the number of pieces in a puzzle. Thus, the neutral state of the [36]octaphyrin is represented as a puzzle with few pieces; the protonated and deprotonated states are presented as puzzles with more pieces to indicate that they are more difficult to complete. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Torrent&#8208;Sucarrat, E. Matito, M. Alonso, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202264).

         <dc:description>Exploiting effective non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we designed and fabricated Co nanoparticles confined in Mo/N co&#8208;doped polyhedral carbon frameworks (Co&#8208;NP/MNCF) derived from polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsuled metal&#8208;organic framework, which showed comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and a larger diffusion&#8208;limited current density. Moreover, the Co&#8208;NP/MNCF also exhibited excellent ORR stability and methanol tolerance. These appealing performances can be attributed to the porosity regulation and heteroatom doping of MOF derived polyhedral carbon frameworks, which could be beneficial for the exposure of more active sites, the optimization of electronic structure and the mass transfer of electrolyte/electro/ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with a Binuclear Bis&#8208;Terpyridine Pyrazole&#8208;Bridged Cobalt Complex
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a binuclear cobalt complex stabilized by a new pyrazole&#8208;based ligand platform substituted with terpyridine groups. The dicobalt complex is electrocatalytically active towards carbon monoxide formation, from carbon dioxide in the presence of Bronsted acids. The terpyridine fragments participate during the electrocatalysis, reducing the overpotential of the reduction reaction.







Abstract
A pyrazole&#8208;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex 1, that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex 1. Infrared spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under CO2 and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8208;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO2. In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8208;site mechanism with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47&#8197;M TFE were present, at &#8722;1.35&#8197;V vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39&#8197;V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50&#8201;%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8208;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO2.

         <dc:description>The cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones is described. Two catalytic systems are tailored for intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;alkyne carboxyamidation and concomitant alkene isomerization. PtCl2/CO (5 mol%, toluene, 100 &#176;C) promotes both carboxyamidation and alkene isomerization but has a limited substrate scope. On the other hand, FeCl&#173;&#173;3 (5 mol%, CH3CN, 100 &#176;C) promotes carboxyamidation effectively but a cocatalyst is required for the exocyclic alkene isomerization. Thus, a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for a broader reaction scope, which involves FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation and base&#8208;induced alkene isomerization. Crossover experiments suggest that these reactions proceed mainly through a mechanism involving acylnitrenoid intermediates rather than carbenoid intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>[ReH3(PPh3)4] &#8208; A Key Compound in the Rhenium Hydride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Tc atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8208;P bond (2.300(2)&#160;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8208;2.449(2)&#160;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8208;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3&#173;(NC(H)CH3)] (5a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8208;N&#8208;C unit with rhenium&#8208;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8208;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8208;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Nontoxic Cl&#8722; transport: The work reports two structurally simple isophthalic acid&#8208;based systems that self&#8208;assemble via different intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to render artificial channels, which facilitate selective translocation of Cl&#8722; ions across liposomes and cells. Interestingly, the transport of Cl&#8722; ions by these ion channels across cell membranes do not exert any toxicity, even at elevated concentrations.







Abstract
Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8722; ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8722; ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8722; channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8722; transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8722; ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Aromatic 1,2&#8208;Azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yls as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Anionic Nitrogen Ligands for Main Group Elements</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;protonated, N&#8208;lithiated and N&#8208;stannylated 1,2&#8208;azaborinines provide versatile platforms for the synthesis of new group 1&#8211;2 and 13&#8211;15 derivatives of the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses show that the aromatic 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand is a purely electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;ligand lacking &#960;&#8208;donor ability.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines 1&#8208;EMe3 and 2&#8208;EMe3 (E=Si, Sn; aryl=Ph (1), Mes (=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl, 2)) were synthesized by ring&#8208;expansion of borole precursors with N3EMe3&#8208;derived nitrenes. Desilylative hydrolysis of 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;SiMe3 yielded the corresponding N&#8208;protonated azaborinines, which were deprotonated with nBuLi or MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Na, K) to the corresponding group 1 salts, 1&#8208;M and 2&#8208;M. While the lithium salts crystallized as monomeric Lewis base adducts, the potassium salts formed coordination polymers or oligomers via intramolecular K&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;aryl &#960; interactions. The reaction of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with CO2 yielded N&#8208;carboxylate salts, which were derivatized by salt metathesis to methyl and silyl esters. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with methyl triflate, [Cp*BeCl] (Cp*=C5Me5), BBr2Ar (Ar=Ph, Mes, 2&#8208;thienyl), ECl3 (E=B, Al, Ga) and PX3 (X=Cl, Br) afforded the respective group 2, 13 and 15 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl complexes. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;K with BBr3 resulted not only in N&#8208;borylation but also Ph&#8208;Br exchange between the endocyclic and exocyclic boron atoms. Solution 11B&#8197;NMR data suggest that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand is similarly electron&#8208;withdrawing to a bromide. In the solid state the endocyclic bond length alternation and the twisting of the C4BN ring increase with the sterics of the substituents at the boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the downfield shift of the endocyclic 11B&#8197;NMR resonances is linearly correlated to both the degree of twisting of the C4BN ring and the tilt angle of the N&#8208;substituent. Calculations indicate that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand has no sizeable &#960;&#8208;donor ability and that the aromaticity of the ring can be subtly tuned by the electronics of the N&#8208;substituent.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hazardous Chemicals from Vapor Phase by an Easily Accessible Breathing Coordination Polymer Derived from Terpyridyl/terephthalate Mixed Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn(II)&#8208;terpyridine based mixed ligand coordination polymer has been designed and synthesized that displayed remarkable ability to breath in response to vapours of a large variety of guests in selective manner.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are extensively studied materials because of their various potential applications. Amongst them, breathing coordination polymers that are capable of exchanging lattice occluded guest molecules with other guests via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) fashion are particularly intriguing. Herein, we disclose an easily accessible breathing coordination polymer namely DMF@Zn&#8208;CP capable of exchanging as many as 23 guest molecules of various kinds in SC&#8211;SC fashion when the crystals of the coordination polymer were exposed to the corresponding vapor of the guests. Selectivity experiments revealed that it was also capable of separating selectively hazardous chemicals such as dichloro&#8208;methane, benzene and fluorobenzene from the corresponding complex mixture of vapors of halomethanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halobenzenes. The breathing coordination polymer could also be exploited as drug delivery vehicle; slow and sustained release of anti&#8208;bacterial agents (benzyl alcohol/phenethyl amine) as guests against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evident in zone inhibition assays. A mixed ligand strategy wherein a nitrile containing terpyridyl ligand (L) and terephthalate (TA) co&#8208;ligand were reacted with Co(II)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) nitrate salts was adopted herein. Three coordination polymers namely MeOH@Co&#8208;CP, DMF/H2O@Ni&#8208;CP and DMF@Zn&#8208;CP were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Studies revealed that only DMF@Zn&#8208;CP possessed the ability to breath in response to the vapors of the guests as stimuli.

         <title>Synthesis and Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation of Bulky Bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides: The Quest for Kinetically Stabilized Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetically stabilized diaryltelluride radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] was obtained by electrochemical and chemical oxidation of the neutral parent telluride (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te.







Abstract
Sterically encumbered bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides, (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se, Te) were obtained by the reaction of the chalcogen tetrafluorides, EF4, with three equivalents of m&#8208;terphenyl lithium, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3Li. The single&#8208;electron oxidation of (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te using XeF2/K[B(C6F5)4] afforded the radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] that was isolated and fully characterized. The electrochemical oxidation of the lighter homologs (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se) was irreversible and impaired by rapid decomposition.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Defect&#8208;Rich Vanadium Oxides as Reversible Polysulfide Conversion Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing dissolution: A defect&#8208;rich sodium vanadium oxide with a proton doping nanobelt was fabricated and used as the functional interface layer in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects and catalytic activity, the dissolution of polysulfide was greatly decreased. The graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier. Therefore, the design of the electrode/separator interface layer is beneficial for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery's life. We have successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and used it as the functional interface layer on the separator in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in the electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Moreover, the extra graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, a Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Anion Exchange Membranes in Hydrogen&#8208;electricity Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion technologies, involving anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are more appealing than the acidic counterparts due to the elimination of precious metal catalysts. However, the physicochemical properties of anion exchange membrane (AEMs), i.e., ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, stability, etc., are inferior to that of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), thus hindering these alkaline technologies from practical employment. To promote their development, we summarize the main challenges and the corresponding strategies of AEMs for the application of AEMFCs and AEMWEs in this review. The hydroxide transportation mechanism, ion exchange capacity, hydration and microscopic morphology that are relevant to the ionic conductivity are discussed firstly. Following the ionic conductivity, another obstacle, stability of AEMs is comprehensively described in terms of alkaline stability, mechanical stability and electrochemical stability. Upon integrating into the devices, water management, carbonation effect and membrane&#8208;electrode interface that are critical to the cell performance are highlighted as well. This review is anticipated to provide insights into the AEM design for hydrogen&#8208;electric energy conversion devices, thus accelerating the widespread commercialization of these promising technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Si on the Oxidation Behaviors of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Si alters the mass diffusion in the oxide scale of the Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000&#8201;&#176;C, which facilitates the diffusion of Ti, Al, as well as O atoms, thus impacting the structure of the oxide scale and its oxidation resistance.







Abstract
In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, and the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000&#8201;&#176;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, the incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.

         <title>Highly selective monomethylation of amines with CO2/H2 via Ag/Al2O3 as catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of monomethylated amines with CO2 is particularly challenging because the formation of tertiary amines is thermodynamically more favorable. Here we explore a new strategy for the controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines from primary amines and CO2/H2. Our first&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the dissociation of H2 via an heterolytic route reduces the reactivity of methylated amines and thus inhibit successive methylation. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS prove the process of formation and decomposition of ammonium salt by secondary amine reversible binding with H+ on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, thereby reducing its reactivity. Meanwhile, the energy barrier for rate&#8208;determining step of monomehylation was much lower than that of over methylation (0.34 eV vs 0.58 eV) means amines monomethylation in preference to successive methylation. Under optimal reaction conditions, a variety of amines conversion to corresponding monomethylated amines in good to excellent yields, and more than 90% yield of product obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Internal Charge Transfer on the Photophysical Properties of Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phosphaquinolinone scaffold has been previously studied as a modular core for a variety of fluorescent species where use of substituent effects has focused on increasing or decreasing electron density in the core rings. We now report the synthesis and analysis of several pyridine&#8208;containing phosphaquinolinone species exhibiting notable linear conjugation from the aryl&#8208;substituent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridyl nitrogen. Varying the nature of the aryl substituent from electron&#8208;withdrawing to electron&#8208;donating leads to the generation of an internal charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) band in the absorbance spectrum, which becomes the dominant absorbance in terms of intensity in the most electron&#8208;rich &#8211;NMe2 example. This heterocycle exhibits improved photophysical properties compared to others in the set including high quantum yield and considerably red&#8208;shifted emission. The enhanced ICT can be observed in the X&#8208;ray data where a rare example of molecule co&#8208;planarity is observed. Computational data show increased localization of negative charge on the pyridyl nitrogen as the electron&#8208;donating character of the aryl&#8208;substituent increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x , where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, were synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x  polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130 &#176;C within 10 s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25 mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.</dc:description>

Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and&#160;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;can act as electron donors&#160;to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products&#160;with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;which exhibited better piezoelectric property were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, we have shown the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts&#160;which can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, we describe a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion processes due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lindqvist polyoxovanadate-alkoxide (POV-alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion processes due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten-substituted POV-alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms.

         <title>Captodative Effect Facilitates the Excitation in Diboron Molecule (CAAC)2B2(SH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the extraordinary versatility in chemical reactions and applications, boron compounds have gained increasing attentions in the past two decades. One of the remarkable advances is the unprecedented preparation of unsaturated boron species. Notably, Braunschweig et al. found that the cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs) stabilized diboron molecules (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 host unpaired electrons and exist in the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form, while other analogues such as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) stabilized diboron molecules prefer a conventional B=B double bond. Since previous studies recognized the differences in the steric effect between CAAC and NHC carbenes, here we focused on the role of thiol substituents in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by gradually localizing involved electrons. The co&#8208;planarity of the thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect were found to be the culprit for the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form of (CAAC)2B2(SR)2. Computational analyses identified two forces contributing to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect of lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boosts the &#960; electron delocalization between the BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron delocalization within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment where the pull effect originates from the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAACs. There are two such independent and orthogonal push&#8208;pull channels which function mainly in individual (CAAC)B(SR) fragments. This enhanced &#960; push&#8208;pull effect in the triplet state facilitates the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Coumarin C&#8211;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(I) C&#8211;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal &#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Managanated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF 4 , opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline&#160;Bi//Zn&#160;batteries&#160;with superb&#160;safety,&#160;low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments&#160;are&#160;severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle&#160;life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20&#160;(MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple&#160;calcination&#160;methode, which shows&#160;excellent&#160;energy storage performances&#160;of superior&#160;specific capacity (294&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.5&#160;A g&#8208;1)&#160;and&#160;outstanding rate capability&#160;(134 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 12&#160;A g&#8208;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1&#160;at the power density of 375&#160;W kg&#8208;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20&#160;as cathode for&#160;RAZBs, which may provide highly promising&#160;material towards better Bi//Zn&#160;battery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures via  i &#960;&#8211; i &#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, was synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Diverse Diterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and Its Sponge&#8208;prey Chelonaplysilla sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigation of the South China Sea nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded, in addition to three known compounds, nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208; (sanyanolides A&#8722;D), clerodane&#8208; (sanyanolide E) and subersin&#8208; (sanyanolides F&#8722;I) type. Remarkably, six diterpenoids aforementioned from H. sanguineus were also isolated from the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region, suggesting a trophic relationship between H. sanguineus and Chelonaplysilla sp. The structure and absolute configuration of new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and/or time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, along with the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms investigated, was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassays, echinoclerodane A exhibited a potent inhibitory effect (IC50 = 2.81 &#956;M) on LPS&#8208;induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, echinoclerodane A and oculatolide showed considerable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 &#956;g/mL.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P. falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P. falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P. falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6 days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Silanols are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Although a handful of approaches have been developed for the synthesis of various silanols, access to enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols remains underdeveloped. This concept intends to summarize and highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols and endeavors to encourage further research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>The Double Aldol&#8208;Tishchenko Reaction of Butanone, Cyclobutanone and a 3&#8208;Pentanone Derived Sulfinylimine and DFT Calculations of the Stereo&#8208;determining Step</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (&lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; up to &amp;gt;99:1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereoisomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with N3B3O3 Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature.&#160; The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in the solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the rising field of organoindium chemistry little is known about the perfluoroorganyl&#8208;substituted indium compounds. The increasing use of indium reagents is explained by their high stability and tolerance towards water and functional groups. Here we report on the synthesis of the novel tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;, and its characterization in salts with the cations [Li(thf)3]+, Cs+, [PPh4]+&#160;and [H14O6]2+&#160;(thf = tetrahydrofuran). To the best of our knowledge, these salts constitute the first perfluoroalkylindates and, in general, the first isolated perfluoroalkylindium compounds which are fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Secondary Orbital Effect Involving Fluorine is Responsible for Substrate&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergence in the Catalyzed syn&#8208;aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet often enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate&#8208;controlled behavior: Ph&gt;F&gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non&#8208;fluorinated and a&#8208;fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that dictate anti&#8208; (a&#8208;aryl) vs. syn&#8208;selectivity (a&#8208;alkyl) using &#945;&#8208;fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radio&#8208;Iodination of Arenes by using Organosilane and Organogermane as Radiolabelling Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radio&#8208;iodination of arenes is investigated from organosilane and organogermane precursors using Ipso&#8208;Electrophilic Halogenation (IEH). Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination in HFIP of either aryl silane or germane, with germanes being more reactive. Clinical potential of arylgermanes as radio&#8208;iodination precursors is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO and [125I]MIBG thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized MOFs&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have become a research forefront in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction attributed to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, adjustable structure and abundant catalytic active sites. Particularly, MOFs can be facilely tuned to match CO2 photoreduction by means of post&#8208;modification of metal nodes, organic linkers with specific functions, and combined with other active materials. Herein, we highlight the recent advances in the construction strategy of MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic materials for CO2 reduction. Some systematic modification strategies on MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are also been discussed, such as modification of metal sites and organic ligands, construction of heterojunction, introduction of single/diatoms and strain engineering. Finally, the future developments directions of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysis in the field of CO2 reduction are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands to Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach, which consists in removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction, is currently developed. In this context, we report the ability of 5 different 12&#8208;membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand in removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1&#8208;thia&#8208;4,7,10&#8208;triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for Cu(II) than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comparison of differently substituted iron porphyrins in their as&#8208;prepared state and after immobilization on carbon indicates no or only a weak interaction with the carbon support. Hydrogen evolution catalysis of the supported systems is improved by electron donating groups that destabilize an Fe(II) intermediate, presumably by assisting in the formation of a radical anion.







Abstract
For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8208;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphyrin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#8901;)]&#8722; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;containing species can &#8220;chemically trap&#8221; CO2, and nesquehonite is one such metastable mineral. Its chemical formula has been debated for decades as Mg(HCO3)(OH)&#8901;2&#8201;H2O or MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O. The thermodynamics of the route to stable carbonates require knowledge of the captured CO2 as either a carbonate or bicarbonate. To determine the precise atomic coordinates of hydrogens present, we combined solid&#8208;state 13C NMR lineshapes and REDOR with density functional theory and confirmation by neutron diffraction. The perturbation of 13C NMR lineshapes by nearby hydrogens is a persuasive indicator. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;E. Hayes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203052).

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amination of Carbonyl Compounds Using Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Aminating Reagents Containing a Transferable (Diarylmethylene)amino Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines. The developed method features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and a simple one&#8208;pot procedure without the need to prepare enolate equivalents separately, thus offering a general and practical approach to the synthesis of a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds. Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical which are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S Ternary Heterostructures with Enhanced LSPR effect for NIR Photonic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photonic disinfection, particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light triggered antibacterial, has emerged as a highly promising solution for combating pathogenic microbes due to its spatiotemporal operability, safety, and low cost of apparatus. However, it remains challenging to construct NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial agents with high light&#8208;converting efficacy and elucidate synergistic mechanisms. In this work, novel ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S ternary heterostructures that can efficiently kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria were synthesized by doping 0D Bi2S3 and Cu2S nanoparticles in the 2D BiOCl nanosheets via a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method. Notably, the incorporation of Cu2S nanoparticles bestows strong NIR light&#8208;harvesting capability to the composite nanosheets due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Upon NIR light illumination, the BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets can exert both enhanced photonic hyperthermia and reaction oxygen species (ROS) generation, serving as single light&#8208;activated bi&#8208;functional photothermal and photodynamic therapeutics. Here, high&#8208;speed hot electrons and large local electronic fields caused by LSPR might play important roles on thermal vibrations and effective carrier separations respectively. Benefiting from the unique ternary heterostructures, both the photothermal conversion efficacy and ROS generation efficacy of BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets are remarkably improved in comparison to the binary BiOCl&#8208;Cu2S or BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3 nanosheets. Accordingly, the ternary composite nanosheets can effectively kill bacteria via the NIR&#8208;driven photonic disinfection mechanism. This work presents a new type of 2D composite nanosheets with ternary heterostructures for NIR photonic disinfection.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering electronic and structural effects in Copper Corrole/Graphene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent hybrid materials based on graphene and A3&#8208;type copper corrole complexes were computationally investigated. The corroles complexes contain strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents at the meso positions. Our results show that the non&#8208;innocent character of corrole moiety modulates the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties once the hybrid systems are held. The graphene&#8208;corrole hybrids displayed outstanding stability via the interplay of dispersion and electrostatic driving forces, while graphene act as an electron reservoir. The hybrid structures exposed an intriguing magneto&#8208;chemical performance, compared to the isolated counterparts, that evidenced how structural and electronic effects contributed to the magnetic response for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Directional spin polarization and spin transfer from the corrole to the graphene surface participate in the amplification. Finally, there are relations between the spin transfer, the magnetic response, and the copper distorted ligand field, offering exciting hints about modulating the magnetic response. Therefore, this work shows that copper corroles emerged as versatile building blocks for graphene hybrid materials, especially in applications requiring a magnetic response.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring expanding Rearrangement of Benzo&#8208;Fused Tris&#8208;Cycloheptenylenes towards Non&#8208;Planar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strongly twisted benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene, containing three dibenzosuberenone units fused to a common benzene ring, was subjected to Ramirez olefination and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acids. The high steric demand within the overcrowded, benzene&#8208;rich benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylenes enforced an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;rearrangement upon &#960;&#8208;extension during the Suzuki coupling reaction. According to crystal structure analysis, the resulting negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two heptagons and one octagon surrounding a central benzene ring as a result of strain release. In the solid state, the materials exhibit a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence with increased quantum yields and a hypsochromic shift of the emission maxima compared to their respective solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Control of Fluorescence Blinking Patterns Based on Electron Transfer in DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging uses changes in the fluorescence intensity and emission wavelength to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To increase the number of targets that can be identified simultaneously, fluorescence blinking can be used as an additional parameter. To understand and eventually control blinking, we used DNA as a platform to elucidate the processes of electron transfer (ET) leading to blinking, down to the rate constants. With a fixed ET distance, various blinking patterns were observed depending on the DNA sequence between the donor and acceptor units of the DNA platform. The blinking pattern was successfully described with a combination of ET rate constants. Therefore, molecules with various blinking patterns can be developed by tuning ET. It is expected that the number of targets that can be analyzed simultaneously will increase by the power of the number of blinking patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>An&#160;Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8208; Function via Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8208; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8208;O bond formation. N2O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN3 (Dipp = 2,6&#8208; iPr2C6H3), while CO2 (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;N(Dipp)CO2}]2 (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8208;dicarboxylate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2(O,O')&#8208;(O2C)2N(Dipp)}] (via the take&#8208;up of a second equivalent of CO2). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi&#8208;aminal complex, Kn[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]n. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo&#8208;reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(O)]2. However, addition of CO2 allows the imine to be released, driven by the formation of the thermodynamically more stable aluminium carbonate co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(&#954;2&#8208;(O,O')&#8208;CO3)]2.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Stretchable Photodetectors: Strategies, Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bit of a stretch: This review lays out the most recent developments in stretchable photodetectors, involving distinct design methods to realize stretchability, various novel function materials selected for photoelectric conversion and excellent properties of stretchable photodetectors.







Abstract
Past decades have witnessed the generation of new stretchable photodetectors in electronic eyes, health sensing, wearable devices, intelligent monitoring and other fields. Stretchable devices require not only outstanding performance but also excellent flexibility, adaptability and stability. Innovative strategies have been proposed to realize the stretchability of devices. In addition, novel functional materials including zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, one&#8208;dimensional inorganic nanomaterials, two&#8208;dimensional layered materials, organic materials, and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials with excellent properties are emerging to continuously improve the performance of devices. Here, the recent research progress of stretchable photodetectors in terms of both various design methods and functional materials is outlined. The optical performance and stretchable properties are also comprehensively reviewed. Finally, a summary and the challenges associated with the application of stretchable photodetectors are presented.

         <title>Energy Level, Crystal Morphology and Fluorescence Emission Tuning in Cocrystals via Molecular&#8208;Level Engineering</title>

New DCAF based charge transfer cocrystals with tunable energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission were prepared via a cocrystal engineering method.







Abstract
Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene &#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through a rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering strategy. Although they are both 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structures, the DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DCPY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted DCPE nanobelts, and the small band gap causes near infrared fluorescence. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space groups and weaker intermolecular interactions exhibited an untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa Cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's fluorescence time! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx), the fluorescence turn&#8208;on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli, because TPE&#8722;OH4 was transferred from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.







Abstract
Herein, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase&#8208;transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.

         <title>Disproportionation and Ligand Lability in Low Oxidation State Boryl&#8208;Tin Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene&#8208;stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], can be synthesized from (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br using Mg(I) or K reducing agents. In contrast to their germanium congeners, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation: NHC abstraction from (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and 2&#8208;electron oxidation of K2[Sn2(boryl)2] both yield a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of Sn(boryl)2 and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4. A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve the vinylidene&#8208;type intermediate (boryl)2Sn=Sn.







Abstract
Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the+1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl={B(NDippCH)2}; NHC=C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2] (3), using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For its binding to the La(hfac)3 lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand L1 must rotate to reach the cis&#8208;cis arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [L1La(hfac)3] complex. The novel rigid, planar and cis&#8208;cis preorganized ligand L8 avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [L8La(hfac)3] complex by three orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (L1&#8211;L7) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;h][1,7]naphthyridines (L8&#8211;L11) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [LkLn(hfac)3] adducts (Lk=L1, L8, L9; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H&#8208;hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand L1 with its preorganized counterparts L8 and L9. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)3] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)3 when L1 is replaced by the preorganized L8&#8211;L9 receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [L1Ln(hfac)3] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&#8745;N&#8745;N cavity in L8 and L9 and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system found in L8 and L9 shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [L8Ln(hfac)3] and [L9Ln(hfac)3] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.

&lt;p&gt;For its binding to the La(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; must rotate to reach the &lt;i&gt;cis-cis&lt;/i&gt; arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;La(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] complex. The novel rigid, planar and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; preorganized ligand &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;La(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] complex by three orders of magnitude.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10-phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d-block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f-block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligands (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L7&lt;/b&gt;) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-h][1,7]naphthyridines (&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L11&lt;/b&gt;) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] adducts (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;=&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H-hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoropentane-2,4-dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; with its preorganized counterparts &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; when &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; is replaced by the preorganized &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&lt;sup&gt;&#8745;&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8745;&lt;/sup&gt;N cavity in &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;-conjugated system found in &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; shifts the ligand-centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [&lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Free Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A little light on electrolytes: We take a timely and comprehensive look at the criteria for high&#8208;voltage magnesium metal batteries (RMBs) from the viewpoint of high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding electrolyte/anode interphase. Potential high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding interphase degradation mechanisms are analyzed in depth.







Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe energy storage devices has spurred increasing interest in high&#8208;voltage rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB). As electrolytes are the bridge connecting the cathode and anode materials, the development of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is the key factor in realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs. This concept presents an overview of three chloride&#8208;free electrolyte systems with wide electrochemical windows, together with the degradation mechanisms and modification strategies at the anode/electrolyte interphase. Finally, future directions in stabilizing Mg anodes and realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs are highlighted.

         <title>Harnessing the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d System for Protein Detection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Based Transcription Amplification</title>

Transcriptional immuno&#8208;CRISPR: A target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for proteins was rationally designed by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based target recognition and binding&#8208;induced in&#8208;vitro transcription to trigger Cas13d&#8208;mediated signal amplification. Such a dual recognition/amplification mode enables protein detection with high specificity and sensitivity, expanding CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d diagnostic toolbox significantly.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for many disease&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detecting nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, herein we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. This system was rationally designed by integrating a dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based transcription amplification strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates in&#8208;vitro RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit, and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>

Synthesis of a synergistic catalyst of Pd single atoms and Pd nanoparticles is presented, which shows broad catalytic activity towards hydrogenation of organic nitro molecules and functional aromatics.







Abstract
Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, boosting their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.

         <title>Crystallographic Deciphering of Spontaneous Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Calciphores to Chiral Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating a metal&#8208;deprivation strategy, a new skeleton of thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine natural product (thiapyricins) with calcium&#8208;binding property was discovered from metal&#8208;tolerant extremophile, Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004. Their characteristic co&#8208;occurrence in the &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form of octahedral chirality visualizes achiral natural products assemble into chiral complexes.







Abstract
Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are new metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.

&lt;p&gt;Thiapyricins (TPC-A/B, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), which are new metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal-deprived conditions by &lt;i&gt;Saccharothrix&lt;/i&gt; sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl-pyridine skeleton of a calcium-binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co-crystalline characteristics of the &lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;holo&lt;/i&gt;-forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &lt;i&gt;&#916;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#923;&lt;/i&gt;-form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four-hierarchical self-assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal-chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteropoly Blue/Carbon Nanotubes Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. The HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) shows promising prospects in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) reaches more than 95&#8201;% in the range of 200&#8211;2400&#8197;nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3&#8208;symmetric Ph6&#8722;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STM investigation of temperature&#8208;controlled deposition of hexaphenyl&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene with thermolabile acetate groups revealed highly ordered coverage and temperature dependent self&#8208;assembly of this C3 symmetric structure. At higher temperature the structure flattens and interacts strongly with the metal substrate due to loss of all acetate groups and the methyl groups resulting in an unsaturated triquinacene core.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach to control the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C3&#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.

         <title>A Foldable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery with Gear&#8208;Structured Composite as Freestanding Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gearing up for portable devices: A flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery uses a freestanding cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of over 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;, and a better capacity retention of &gt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;. The highly flexible, safe, aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens up a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronic devices.







Abstract
A foldable battery with high flexibility provides great potential in various wearable electronic devices for health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery with a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of up to 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2 was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as 580&#8201;% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78&#8197;N. The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8&#8201;% after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;, thereby indicating a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry greatly improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outward configuration. Meanwhile the Zn2+ ionic conductivity was improved by rapid re&#8208;binding of many existing hydroxy groups from the electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitation.

Plasmonic hot&#8208;electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 further modulates the chemical states of Fe on the Fe5C2 surfaces, enabling a 7.2&#8208;fold increase in C2+ yield in photothermal CO hydrogenation.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential to synthesize light hydrocarbons by using solar energy. However, the selectivity and activity of the reaction are still far below those achieved in conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30&#8201;% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8211;time velocity of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using in&#8208;situ&#8208;irradiated XPS, we show that light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. This work suggests that it is possible for plasmon&#8208;mediated surface chemistry to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis as well as biochemical and structural characterization of long&#8208;chain maytansinoids and maytansinoid conjugates is reported. The results show the prospects of maytansinoids as probes to study microtubule dynamics and lead towards the design of new maytansine&#8208;based derivatives.







Abstract
Maytansinoids are a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics has been held back by the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity or the scaffold's binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.

A good chemistry, like a great music, sometimes needs a good collaboration. The Cover Picture shows a combination of nitrogen&#8208;deleting anomeric amide power (discovered by Levin's group from the University of Chicago) and parallel synthesis capabilities of Ukrainian chemists, which resulted in a combinatorial library obtained through formal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling and a unique synthetically accessible chemical space of nearly 600&#8197;K representatives.

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts during water oxidation has become a common understanding. The obtained metal (oxy)hydroxide layers derived from surface reconstruction process usually show much higher electrocatalytic performance than the directed synthesized (oxy)hydroxide counterparts, highlighting the key role of interaction between substrate materials and surface reconstructed active species. Read more about reconstructed chemistry and substrate effect in transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts in the Review article by W. Luo et&#8197;al.







Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.
