         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8722;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocenters is highly desirable in organic chemistry.&#160; In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocenters and three new C&#8208;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17 steps, overall yield; 6.5%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler type reaction for the construction of the D ring.</dc:description>

         <title>An efficient, site&#8208;selective and spontaneous peptide macrocyclisation during in vitro translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work we report a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that we show can be incorporated into peptides by both in vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Using molecular dynamics simulation we show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. It is of great importance to accelerate the activation of O2 to generate highly active oxygen species, such as hydroxyl peroxide and hydroxyl species to improve catalytic performance for selective oxidation of methane. Selective oxidation of methane using O2 by coupling in&#8208;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide via tandem catalysis ensures the easy formation of active oxygen species for methane activation, leading to high oxygenates productivity under mild conditions. In this concept, we summarized the recent progresses for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using O2 based on tandem catalysis by coupling with in&#8208;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates via tandem catalysis were also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoric&#8208;Acid Retention in High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to improve PA retention: The leakage of phosphoric acid (PA) from PA&#8208;doped proton&#8208;exchange membranes (PEMs) is a key issue for high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). The detailed discussion of the recent progress to mitigate the PA loss in HT&#8208;PEMs is described in this Concept. Moreover, a new idea is provided on how to decrease the leaching of PA in PEMs with a high acid concentration, and how to address the remaining technical issues.







Abstract
Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PEMs. The probable mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention for example via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrene Transfer by an FeIV&#8208;Imido Complex Generated by a Comproportionation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIV imide of a tetracarbene macrocycle active in nitrene transfer reactions can be generated from phenyltosyliodinane (PhI=NTs) either from the FeII precursor by oxidative addition (right) or from the FeIII precursor by a comproportionation reaction (left) (AN=acetonitrile, bold horizontal bars=macrocycle).







Abstract
Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged as one of the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from FeII and FeIII precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an FeIV tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the FeII precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from an FeIII precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the FeIII precursor, an FeIII tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an FeV tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active FeIV tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the FeIII precursor.

In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV-visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI-MS and DFT studies, an Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; precursor was expected by a two-electron oxidative addition, its formation from an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV-visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI-MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor, an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an Fe&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of bimetallic C^C* platinum(II) complexes with bridging diphenylformamidinates is presented alongside with two solid&#8208;state structures. The phosphorescent compounds show excellent emissive behavior with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and lifetimes around 2&#8197;&#956;s. The substitution pattern in the bridging ligands influences next to the structural properties (intermetallic distance) also the photophysical characteristics. The observed effects are explained and supported by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A series of phosphorescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes is presented, which were synthesized by the combination of bidentate cyclometalated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and different bridging diphenylformamidinates. The complexes were characterized by standard techniques and additionally two solid&#8208;state structures could be obtained. Photoluminescence measurements revealed the strong emissive behavior of the compounds with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and emission lifetimes of approx. 2&#8197;&#956;s. The effect of the substitution pattern in the bridging ligands on the structural and photophysical properties of the complexes was examined in detail and rationalized by density functional theory calculations (PBE0/6&#8208;311G*).

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Gold(I) and Silver(I) Selenourea Complexes as Anticancer Agents Targeting TrxR and Cellular Redox Homeostasis</title>

Innovative Au(I) and Ag(I) NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes exhibit a prominent anticancer effect by selectively targeting TrxR in human cancer cells, thus hampering cancer cell redox machinery and inducing apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential in&#8197;vitro, on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel synthesis strategy for facile access to a huge family of liquid crystal dimers or mono&#8208;addition homologues characterized with phosphonic group, which is readily achieved with P&#8722;C bonding through addition reaction between P&#8722;H and non&#8208;conjugated vinyl group. The introduced phosphonic group enables homeotropic alignment and further functionalization and one of the LC dimers exhibits NTB phase directly from the isotropic state.







Abstract
Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTB) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of NTB phase.

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very bright NIR polymethines bearing a trianionic chromophore comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized and characterized. The obtained dyes are among the brightest fluorophores in the polymethine family. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirmed the structure of one of the synthesized trianionic dyes.







Abstract
Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242; type comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) have been synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#1013; up to 495&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date &#8211; with a magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Anolyte with an Extremely Low Reduction Potential for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyanopyridines are reduced at low potentials in organic solvents and are therefore a promising class of molecules for anolytes for nonaqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFBs). Quantum computations suggest that properly placed phenyl and methyl substituents shift the reduction potentials even lower than those of the parent cyanopyridines and prevent dimerization of the radical anions. The optimal molecule has a reduction potential in CH3CN of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0, the lowest reported for a RFB anolyte.







Abstract
Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene+/0 (Fc+/0), but the 3&#8208;CNPy&#8901;&#8722; radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at E&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu4][PF6] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their E1/2 only about +0.10&#8197;V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy and 3&#8208;CN&#8208;4&#8208;PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at E1/2=&#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22&#8197;V vs. ferrocene+/0, respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30&#8197;bulk charge&#8208;discharge cycles. An improved version of 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy with three methyl groups (3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21&#8201;% of capacity per cycle during charge&#8208;discharge cycling in acetonitrile.

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivative, CTX[P(O)Ph], was reported as an efficient iodine adsorbent here. The CTX[P(O)Ph] powder exhibited high performance in both of iodine vapor adsorption and iodine aqueous solution adsorption. More importantly, two types of iodine loading crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to reveal the adsorption mechanism.







Abstract
Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;point interaction between a chiral amine and a triarylborane is shown to suffice to induce a preferential propeller handedness to the borane. Rotation of aryl blades can be avoided by incorporation of naphthyl instead of phenyl and a bulky amine component.







Abstract
Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, meaning that the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, it was shown that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. Although DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8211;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached with Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>

Dibenzothiepin&#8208;based redox pair and its analogues exhibit an electrochomic behavior with drastic change in the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, thus suitable for developing new bioimaging protocols. The structural change of the central seven&#8208;membered ring was found to be the key to gain electrochemical bistability upon two&#8208;electron transfer nearly at the same potential.







Abstract
10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[bf]thiepin (1) and &#8208;oxepin (2) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (12+ and 22+) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for 1/12+ and 2/22+, thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide analogue (3/32+) exhibits quite similar dynamic redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin and &#8208;oxepin unit in 12+ and 22+, whereas the thiepin&#8208;S&#8208;oxide derivative (4/42+) does not exhibit bistability due to the smaller change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.

         <title>The Insertion of EII and EIV Chlorides (E=Si, Ge) into the Si&#8722;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>

Inserting tetrylenes into the Si&#8722;Si bond of a base&#8208;stabilized disilylene produced new examples of bis(silylene), asymmetric disilylene and germylene&#8208;silylene compounds. Additionally, the reactivity of the starting disilylene towards SiIV chlorides was investigated.







Abstract
Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#8901;ECl2 (E=Si, L=IPr; E=Ge, L=dioxane) with the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8722;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8722;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8722;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines.







Abstract
A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines. The broad functional group compatibility includes halogens, ester, alcohol, sulfone as well as thiophene. This methodology is also suitable for benzo[d]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole, thiazoimidazole and tetrahydroisoquinoline, and can be scaled up to 5&#8197;mmol. Mechanistic insights are discussed.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cadaside B is a novel calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, bearing multiple rare non&#8208;canonical amino acids and exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Synthetic studies towards cadaside B yielded a compound possessing the desired connectivity of macrocyclic scaffold, but poorly matching 1H NMR spectra and lack of bioactivity. Insights and challenges towards the total synthesis are presented.







Abstract
In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different 1H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy was proposed by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve photochemical fluorescence enhancement behavior, which provides a valuable design principle for photoconvertable fluorophores by controllably regulating photophysical processes and photochemical reactions of AIEgens.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for superstable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100&#8201;% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Is&#8208;PETase: An Enzyme Capable of Degrading Poly(ethylene) Terephthalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme is&#8208;PETase degrades poly(ethylene) terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. This makes is&#8208;PETase a promising candidate for the biodegradation of this common pollutant. The energy profile for the degradation of a PET substrate mimic by is&#8208;PETase was calculated by using computational quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanical methods, and the activation energy for this reaction was calculated to be 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Is&#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is&lt;/i&gt;-PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD-PBEP86-D3/ma-def2-TZVP/CHARMM27//rev-PBE-D3/dev2-SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease-type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

What can you give? Reactivity studies of the L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 complex were performed to determine the effect of GeII&#8594;B donation. An unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 was isolated. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and proton affinity.







Abstract
Reactivity studies of the GeII&#8594;B complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 (1; L=2&#8208;Et2NCH2&#8208;4,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C6H2) were performed to determine the effect on the GeII&#8594;B donation. N&#8208;coordinated compounds L(OtBu)Ge&#8901;BH3 (2) and [LGe&#8901;BH3]2 (3) were prepared. The possible tuning of the GeII&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1&#8208;PPh2&#8208;8&#8208;(LGe)&#8208;C10H6 (4) and L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 (5) without a GeII&#8594;B interaction. In 5, an unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results were complemented by a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in 1&#8722;5. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis. The basicity of different L(X)Ge groups through proton affinity is also assessed.

         <title>Stacking Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacking interactions turn on halogen &#963;&#8208;hole in unactivated chloro&#8208; and bromo&#8208;arenes which are thus enabled to function as good halogen bonding donors.







Abstract
The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArX (ArX=PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Cl, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Br, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br2C6H4) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5&#8197;kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (12.5&#8197;kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling reaction was optimized. A series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without any racemization. A plausible and novel mechanism was proposed and this method is useful for preparing various C&#8722;X bonds efficiently.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side&#8208;products are generated under classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were proposed, which resulted in clean conversion from chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N1,N2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, a series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8722;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different nucleophiles.

A new inhibitor of ATP synthase: Through photoaffinity labelling and chemoproteomics analysis it was discovered, and subsequently validated, that phomoxanthone A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. This discovery may inspire the design of new inhibitors targeting the beta subunit of ATP synthase.







Abstract
Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s), we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#8197;&#956;M phomoxanthone&#8197;A.

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergent paired metal electrocatalysis enables the direct use of simple primary and secondary aliphatic acids as coupling partners for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation by radical decarboxylation. This new electrophotocatalytic method features a broad substrate scope, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance, and could be used for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
An electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides is reported. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis. This new electrophotocatalytic method is mild, robust, and most importantly, capable of accommodating simple primary aliphatic acids including acetic acid &#8211; ubiquitous and variegated structural motifs yet remain oddly challenging substrates &#8211; directly as native functional groups for decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation.

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe2) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.







Abstract
Several base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions (2 and 3) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidene ions 3&#8201;c,d stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the silylene&#8208; and sulfide&#8208;supported one (2&#8208;H and 3&#8201;a) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Moreover, HBPin adduct of 3&#8201;a (8&#8208;C) catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine. Of particular interest, silylene&#8208;supported silyliumylidene complex 2&#8208;H is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have been known as compelling functional polymers due to their unprecedented properties such as molecular anisotropy, superior responsive characteristics and reversible shape memory actuation. However, these outstanding properties have to do with permanent crosslinking networks that strongly restrict the scope of their applicability. In this Review article 10.1002/chem.202201957, Prof. L. Wang and Prof. W. Feng et al. address this issue by discussing the marriage of LCEs with dynamic covalent chemistry as a new paradigm for the development of advanced functional polymers with fascinating adaptive and dynamic features, which are of paramount significance for many emerging smart applications such as adaptive optics, soft robotics, bioinspired camouflage, 3D/4D printing technology, and beyond.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials modification is one of the most efficient strategies for microbial CO2 reduction systems. These modifications can dramatically affect the properties in chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility and surface area, which provides them with significant advances for microbial CO2 reduction systems. This review summarizes the recent progress in the rational design of nanomaterials for facilitating energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Nanomaterials modification is one of the most efficient strategies for microbial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems. These modifications can dramatically affect the properties in chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility and surface area, which provides them with significant advances for microbial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems. This review summarizes the recent progress in the rational design of nanomaterials for facilitating energy conversion. An introductive discussion on the realization of their large-scale application is illustrated (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202202317"&gt;10.1002/chem.202202317&lt;/a&gt;).

Insertion of silylene: SiCl2 into the Si&#8722;Si bond of a phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported disilylene affords a SiCl2&#8208;bridged bis(silylene) that, upon heating, rearranges into a silyl&#8208;substituted disilylene. Analogous insertion of GeCl2 leads directly to a silyl&#8208;substituted silylene&#8208;germylene derivative. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202799).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 70, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into a sustainable and environmentally valuable technology: Benefitting from superior chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area, functional nanomaterials&#8208;based electrocathodes, nanostructured photocathodes, and semiconductor nanomaterials have been recognized as promising candidates for microbial CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals. This minireview surveys the latest advances in the rational design of nanomaterials for different types of microbial CO2 reduction systems.







Abstract
Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhancement of the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface is detailed. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) engineering with inter&#8208;/intramolecular CT interactions by simple compositions has emerged as a universal and efficient way to construct organic functional materials. Stable organic radicals with unique physicochemical properties that cannot be realized in closed&#8208;shell molecules, have been widely demonstrated to be ideal building blocks to construct versatile organic CT materials. In this concept article, we provide a brief overview of the advances in the design, structure and property of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT molecular functional materials, and the strategy for the generation of these materials is also highlighted. We firstly introduce radicals as open&#8208;shell donors or acceptors, and focus on their importance and uniqueness in improving electrical, magnetic and optical properties of CT functional materials. Additionally, CT interactions in stable radical dimers and trimers are further discussed systematically. Finally, we summarize the challenges and provide several perspectives for future development of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reaction of&#160;N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic transformations of&#160;N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides&#160;such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones,&#160;is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding&#160;the&#160;aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore,&#160;N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of&#160;N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via&#160;in situ&#160;silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without&#160;unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. In this study, the first total synthesis, absolute configuration, and phytotoxic activity are described. Foeniculoxin and hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.







Abstract
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and an advanced Mosher's method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A.&#8197;thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.

         <title>Terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Landscape beyond the oxo&#8208;wall. The terminal auronitrene and auroxyl species [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; are identified as local minima by calculation and experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) in the gas phase. These open&#8208;shell species defy the standard rules to assign oxidation states since the unpaired electrons are located on the terminal monoatomic ligand (N and O) rather than on the metal.







Abstract
Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2): They respectively arise by N2 or NO2 dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF3)3Au(N3)]&#8722; and [(CF3)3Au(ONO2)]&#8722; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF3)3AuF]&#8722;, they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(iii) moiety (CF3)3Au with singly charged anions X&#8722; of the most electronegative elements (X=F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF3)3AuX]&#8722; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>

Synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization. We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8722;Se and Csp2&#8722;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8722;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorus&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first donor&#8208;free bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium ions were prepared, and their reactivity was investigated. The compounds possess extreme Lewis acidity up to the strongest monocationic phosphonium&#8208;based fluoride ion acceptor isolable to date. Numerous novel phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperative reaction modes were observed toward silanes and unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.







Abstract
The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorus catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article summarizes recent research progresses about the surface treatment of the perovskite film using organic ammonium salts (OASs) for improved performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Diverse roles of OASs and their working principles are discussed, and key factors that influence the roles of OASs are proposed to suggest how to further promote efficiency and stability of PSCs.







Abstract
The roles of organic ammonium salts (OASs) which are widely used for the surface treatment of the perovskite film, including formation of 2D perovskites, direct surface passiviation, and other effects, have been reviewed. The influencing factors for these roles of OASs are also discussed, which are important for improved efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. More information can be found in the Review article by X. Guo and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203001)

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in MnI&#8208;Catalysed N&#8208;Formylation of Secondary Amides and Lactams Using CO2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnI complex coordinated with a redox non&#8208;innocent phenalenyl (PLY) ligand is reported for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides (including late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutics) and lactams with CO2 as C1 source at room temperature for the first time. A combined approach of experimental analysis and DFT calculations sketch the plausible radical&#8208;mediated pathway of an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, involving a ligand&#8208;centred radical.







Abstract
A MnI catalyst featuring redox&#8208;active tridentate phenalenyl (PLY) ligand has been used for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides and lactams under 1&#8197;atm CO2 as a C1 source at room temperature for the first time. The protocol is applicable to a wide range of secondary amides including heterocycles, bio&#8208;active cinnamide derivatives and the diversification of therapeutic molecules. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations based on experimental outcomes and DFT calculations suggested an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, where a ligand&#8208;centred radical plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction process.

         <title>Preparation of N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl Imino Peptides and Their Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Diastereoselective Indolylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups was successfully achieved using MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation. Also the highly diastereoselective indolylation of the iminopeptides was realized, which allows selective access to each diastereomer of the adduct from the same substrate using an appropriate chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. The origin of the diastereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculations.

N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups were successfully prepared by MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation and then subjected to diastereoselective indolylation.

These transformations would be useful for synthesizing non&#8208;canonical amino acid&#8208;containing peptides as novel drug candidates.

         <title>A Triazolium&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Enables Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven siRNA Binding and Esterase&#8208;Induced Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles lose the ability to bind siRNA upon addition of esterase, due to the degradation of the polar head group and conversion to a neutral triazole.







Abstract
The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile self&#8208;assembles into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall approach may have broad utility beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Heterostructured Perovskite Films for Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing components and structures of heterostructured perovskite films is an efficient strategy to yield highly stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. In this concept, we have highlighted the progress in research on spontaneous formation behavior in perovskite composite layers and provided a perspective on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and future challenges and opportunities for perovskite heterostructural materials.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems. Herein, we review the basic principles of and recent progress in the spontaneous formation behavior of heterostructured perovskite thin films. This concept provides insightful clues for the design and fabrication of stable and efficient PSCs for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Transition Metal Oxides as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving TMOs: The search for transition metal oxide (TMO) electrocatalysts is important but challenging. TMO electrocatalysts have the advantage of low cost, but also inherent disadvantages, such as poor electron conductivity. To meet industrial demands, better TMOs need to be identified by extensive searching, catalyst design, and structural engineering.







Abstract
As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage has become increasingly prominent. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted broad attention as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.

Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less-noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO-like materials have attracted broad attention as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for Investigating Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;particle measurements have been applied in the field of electrochemical energy storage as well as electrocatalysis, and great achievements have been made in terms of understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes.







Abstract
The relationship between interface structure (e.&#8201;g., the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of the corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis that allow the evolution and kinetics of electrodes to be understood by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single&#8208;particle measurements are also discussed.

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Materials Class for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;anion Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the necessary but conflicting properties requirements of NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive concerns as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages between oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of the reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of the rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic synthesis of acetals and ketals from aldehydes and silylenolethers without the use of acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for the acetalization and ketalization was developed by means of photoredox catalysis. The biscyanolated perylene bisimide is used as electron&#8208;poor photocatalyst, together with green light (525 nm LED). Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes react efficiently to acetals in good to excellent yields. A broad substrate range was shown with respect to both the aldehydes and the alcohols. The functional group tolerance is high. Especially acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated. Aldehydes can also be directly and selectively converted into the respective acetals. Only ketones must be converted to their silylenolethers before ketalization. This photocatalytic method works completely without the use of acids or photoacids, and does not need any additives or H&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Hence, it broadens the substrate scope and repertoire of photo&#8208;redox catalysis with respect to carbonyl chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Paramagnetic liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing: The effect of Blatter radical planarization on behavior of bent&#8208;core mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of organized banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;stepped synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be finely tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon&#8208;Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward the improvement of semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends on the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications such as organocatalysis. In this context, we present herein the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction. Different dienophiles as well as imines of variable electronic nature efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8208;38 M&#8208;1 were measured in dichloromethane.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron-rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium-based derivatives and their use in different applications such as organocatalysis. In this context, we present herein the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction. Different dienophiles as well as imines of variable electronic nature efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three-component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N-phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22-38 M-1 were measured in dichloromethane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diarylethene isomerization using triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation photon upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation photon upconversion using the well&#8208;studied upconversion pair 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA)/platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) is used to reversibly drive the photoisomerization of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches using visible light. By carefully selecting the kinetic and spectral properties of the molecular system as well as the experimental geometry, a single green light source can be used to selectively trigger both the ring&#8208;opening and the ring&#8208;closing reactions, whilst also inducing fluorescence from the closed colored isomer that can be used as a readout to monitor the isomerization process in situ. The upconversion solution and the DAE solution are kept physically separated, allowing to characterize them both concomitantly and individually without further separation processes. The ring&#8208;closing reaction using upconverted photons is quantified and compared to the efficiency of direct isomerization using ultraviolet light.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 (R=Mes, Mes*) is described. Derivatization at the oxygen atom with electrophiles is possible, facilitating subsequent reactivity pathways including, for example, spontaneous decarbonylation.







Abstract
Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate, iPr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R=Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KOtBu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(SiiPr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(SiiPr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R=Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(SiiPr3)(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R=Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and iPr3SiPCO.

         <title>Assembly of Rolling Circle Amplification&#8208;Produced Ultralong Single&#8208;Stranded DNA to Construct Biofunctional DNA Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA materials have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications due to their predictable structure and designable functions. Recently, various biofunctional DNA materials have been developed through rolling circle amplification (RCA). Herein, the assembly strategies to construct RCA&#8208;based DNA material in recent years are summarized in two main parts, including the construction of DNA hydrogel and DNA nanocomplex.

The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrophenazines are receiving increasing attention due to applications in numerous fields of chemistry, from light emission to organo&#8208;photocatalysis. Despite this growing interest and numerous works involving the preparation of radical cations based on this scaffold, the isolation and study of the aromatic dications obtained by 2 electron oxidation of dihydrophenazines is still mostly unexplored. From this point of view, along with the substitution at the N atoms generally used to tune dihydrophenazine properties, the p&#8208;extension of the phenazine core could play a crucial role in making dicationic states accessible. This could result in an extension of the knowledge on these elusive dications and in potentially highly interesting applications ranging from material science to molecular actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8208; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960; &#8211; system.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihyroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance, such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of 2.3 GHz (0.077 cm&#8208;1 (JS1S2 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2 GHz (0.040 cm&#8208;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Oligo(arylfuran)s and Its Application in OLED as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by preinstall of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs. And our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s as p&#8208;type organic semiconductors for OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation and Characterization of the Hg&#8208;O Diatomic Molecule: A Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercury atoms from laser ablation of a dental amalgam target react with oxygen atoms upon co&#8208;condensation in excess argon and neon, and they provide frequencies of 521.2 and 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, which support high&#8208;level calculations for this weakly bound Hg&#8722;O diatomic molecule. The small difference between our neon and argon matrix observations for Hg&#8722;O suggest a slightly ionic molecule. Spectra are also observed for Hg&#8208;O2 and Hg&#8208;O3.







Abstract
Mercuric oxide is a well&#8208;known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8722;O is very fragile and does not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam alloy target into argon or neon containing about 0.3&#8201;% of 16O2 or of 18O2 during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4&#8197;K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;16O or at 496.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;18O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4=1.0499. Solid neon gives a 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 absorption with a small 7.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg16O and 562&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg18O (frequency ratio=1.0569). Such calculations usually produce harmonic frequencies that are slightly higher than the anharmonic (observed) values, which supports their relationship. These observed frequencies have the isotopic shift predicted for Hg&#8722;O and are within the range of recent high&#8208;level frequency calculations for the Hg&#8722;O molecule. Spectra for the related mercury superoxide and ozonide species are also considered for the first time.

         <title>Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes by Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;membered phosphabenzene contracts to a five&#8208;membered hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of hydrochloric acid. This unusual reaction can only proceed because the special electronic properties of phosphinines, in combination with the particular reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate organophosphorus species, allow sequential reactions at the aromatic phosphorus heterocycles; this is in clear contrast to functionalized pyridines. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. M&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203406).

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solvents are not indispensable in the St&#246;ber method and its extensions. Ethanol produced from the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) already makes the reactants miscible and completes the synthesis. A simple organic solvent&#8208;free alternative to the St&#246;ber process enables the synthesis of controllable uniform silica spheres and has the potential to be extended to other St&#246;ber process&#8208;based material syntheses.

The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, ethanol was used as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. It was found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. An initially immiscible synthesis method was discovered, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value for the extension to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organic solvents are not indispensable in the St&#246;ber method&lt;/b&gt; and its extensions. Ethanol produced from the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) already makes the reactants miscible and completes the synthesis. A simple organic solvent-free alternative to the St&#246;ber process enables the synthesis of controllable uniform silica spheres and has the potential to be extended to other St&#246;ber process-based material syntheses.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are reviewed from the perspectives of materials, including ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites, as well as device engineering. Device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting the microcavity effect, and light outcoupling enhancement, are also discussed. This review aims to pave the way for researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.







Abstract
Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behaviour of Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy revealed three antiviral drugs in the bRo5 space to behave as &#8220;partial&#8221; molecular chameleons. Their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area is proposed to improve their cell permeability and contribute to oral absorption. A fourth drug was found not to be chameleonic.







Abstract
The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski's rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;d6) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;d6 and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multiple TMEs&#8208;responsive nanoplatform was designed and synthesized. The nanoplatform constructed by of rare earth nanoparticles and layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs), It serves as a TMEs stimulation response nanoplatform for enhanced synergistic therapy.







Abstract
The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni2+ and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni2+ with abundant H2S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.

         <title>Sulfation of Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell&#8208;Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ligands for nanoprobes: GAG nanoprobes composed of synthetic heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate ligands give a broad picture of cell&#8208;specific homing of nanoparticles and provide a novel opportunity for nanomedicine. Chondroitin sulfate E is a potential ligand for designing nanoprobes to target CD44&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and neurites.







Abstract
Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor cells or neurons influences the development of a potential drug&#8208; or gene&#8208;delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderately aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, thus indicating the presence of more than one form of receptor&#8208;mediated uptake. However, U87 cells, olfactory bulb, and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E&#8208;coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that the 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe used the CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for uptake. These results could lead to new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of an efficient DBU/iron co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component perfluoroalkylvinylation of alkenes has been reported through a radical process under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU)/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation by using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners is demonstrated. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8722;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8722;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of alkyl chlorides to synthesize aldehydes has been developed. Depending on the conditions both linear and branched aldehydes can be obtained in a selective manner from readily available substrates.







Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealed Rh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.

         <title>Bis(Vinylenedithio)&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulphurous lateral interactions. For electroactive coordination polymers, through space charge transport phenomenon are most often 1D. By increasing the size of the electroactive core, lateral sulphur&#8208;sulphur interaction take place and create a 2D conducting pathway. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation is used to increase the materials conductivity.







Abstract
Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) coordination polymer. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8211;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distribution by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, diene, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer&#8208; conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8208;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8208;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8208;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5% at 0.68 V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about that base! Our quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how bases can effectively catalyze the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by promoting both the normal electron demand orbital interactions and electrostatic interactions. This study demonstrates the underlying mechanistic differences between the base&#8208;catalyzed and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, for example, by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of the double&#8208;bond torsion in chalcones has a significant effect on the solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;chemical reactivity to tune the photomechanical effects of their crystals.







Abstract
Three groups of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X=F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of the crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. Cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to undergo trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously took place in crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three groups of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X=F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo-induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of the crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. Cyclic 3,4-dihydronaphthalene-based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to undergo &lt;i&gt;trans-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman-based molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and &lt;i&gt;trans-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization simultaneously took place in crystals. Photo-induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman-based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid-state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Behavior of 7&#8208;Azaindole for Mechanistic Investigation of Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling and Application to 7&#8208; Azaindole Based Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions. The role of DBU as a base and also as an auxiliary ligand in the course of the reaction has been established. The transmetalated monomeric aryl&#8208;copper(II) species generated from the dimeric unit is oxidized by another equivalent of copper(II) to yield an aryl&#8208;copper(III) intermediate for facile N&#8208;arylation, which has been authenticated with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The regeneration of the copper(II)&#8208;catalyst by aerial oxidation of colorless copper(I) species (generated via reductive elimination and disproportionation step) is confirmed by mass and absorption spectroscopy. Detailed DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations help to rationalize the proposed reaction intermediates and their corresponding electronic transitions. Moreover, the confirmation of copper(I)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole intermediate via HRMS reaffirmed the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species in the Chan&#8208;Lam type of coupling. A medicinally&#8208;important 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor has been synthesized via sequential arylation</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation in the Gas Phase: Spectroscopic Characterization of C&#8211;N Coupling in the V3C+ + N2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C+ + N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1 symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530 cm&#8208;1) and V&#8208;N single bond (770, 541 and 522 cm&#8208;1) stretching bands.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic co&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;anionic porphyrins has been extensively researched in the construction of hierarchically organized architectures with potential application value in organic semiconductors, sunlight catalysts and supramolecular chirality systems. However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single&#8208;crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8208;) and N,&#160;N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8208; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J&#8208;aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4&#8208; strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization Route to Functional Polyesters from an Activated Diester Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo&#8208;catalyzed (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl&#8208;diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing "monofunctional impurity" or "stoichiometric imbalance," this methodology can afford well&#8208;defined end&#8208;functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non&#8208;activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring&#8208;opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable, Malleable, Ecofriendly Recyclable and Robust Polyimine Thermosets Derived from Trifluoromethyl Diphenoxybenzene Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry opens up great opportunities for a sustainable society by producing reprocessable networks of polymers and even thermosets. However, achieving the closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers with high performance remains a grand challenge. The introduction of aromatic monomers and fluorine into covalent adaptable networks is an attractive method to tackle this challenge. Therefore, we present a facile and universal strategy to focus on the design and applications of polyimine vitrimers containing trifluoromethyl diphenoxybenzene backbones&#160;in applications of dynamic covalent polymers. In this study, fluorine&#8208;containing polyimine vitrimer networks (FPIVs) were fabricated, and the results revealed that the FPIVs not only exhibited good self&#8208;healability, malleability and processability without the aid of any catalyst, but also possessed decent mechanical strength, superior toughness and thermal stability. We hope that this work could provide a novel pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance polyimine vitrimers by upcycling of plastic wastes.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Stereoselectivity in SE2' Reactions of Six&#8208;membered Ring Oxocarbenium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxocarbenium ions are key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. To generate a series of structure&#8722;reactivity&#8208;stereoselectivity principles for these species, we herein investigated the bimolecular electrophilic substitution reactions (SE2') between allyltrimethylsilane and a series of archetypal six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions using a combined density functional theory (DFT) and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. These reactions preferentially proceed following a reaction path where the oxocarbenium ion transforms from a half chair (3H4 or 4H3) to a chair conformation. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions, dramatically influences the conformational preference of the canonical 3H4 and 4H3 conformers, and thereby the stereochemical outcome of the SE2' reaction. In general, we find that the stereoselectivity in the reactions correlates to the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221; of the cations, as dictated by their shape. However, for the C5&#8208;CH2OMe substituent, steric factors override the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221;, showing a more selective reaction than expected based on the shape of the ion. Our SE2' energetics correlate well with experimentally observed stereoselectivity, and the use of the activation strain model has enabled us to quantify important interactions and structural features that occur in the transition state of the reactions to precisely understand the relative energy barriers of the diastereotopic addition reactions. The fundamental mechanistic insight provided in this study will aid in understanding the reactivity of more complex glycosyl cations featuring multiple substituents and will facilitate our general understanding of glycosylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Investigation of Protein&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions: The Recognition of Glycans by Galectins Engineered with Fluorotryptophan Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of single&#8208;19F&#8208;tryptophan residues into two glycan binding proteins, Galectin&#8208;3 and Galectin&#8208;8, was exploited to monitor their binding to carbohydrate ligands by using NMR spectroscopy. Although the affinity of the molecular recognition events was not substantially altered, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provided interesting added values with respect to other NMR binding strategies.







Abstract
Fluorine (19F) incorporation into glycan&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking involving a conserved tryptophan residue. Herein, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), respectively, were selected. Gal3 contains one Trp, whereas Gal8 contains three, one at each binding site and a third one not involved in sugar binding; these were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange on the 19F NMR chemical&#8208;shift timescale, even for weak ligands, and allowed binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin to be individualized.

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calibration to experimental data produces accurate computational predictions of NIR dye absorbance and emission for unknown derivatives, allowing for identification of fine&#8208;tuning modifications.







Abstract
A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8&#8201;%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs) Comprising Imidazolium Cations Blocked with Methyl&#8208;, Propyl&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Groups at the C2 Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blocking the C2 position of imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with methyl, propyl and phenyl groups has a strong influence on their physicochemical properties like viscosity and conductivity. Especially the electrochemical window can be enlarged. Electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aryl ring could further change the electron density which has also been analyzed by quantum chemical DFT calculations.







Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids are very popular for different applications because of their low viscosity and melting point. However, the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the imidazolium cation can easily be deprotonated by a base, resulting in a reactive carbene. If an inert ionic liquid is needed, it is necessary to introduce an unreactive alkyl or aryl group at the C2 position to prevent deprotonation. Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) were first introduced by our group in 2009 and are characterized by a phenyl group at the N1 position, which offers the possibility to fine&#8208;tune the physicochemical properties by using different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing substituents. In this work, we present a new series of TAAILs where the C2 position is blocked by a methyl, propyl or phenyl group. For each of the blocking groups, the phenyl and three different phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F2) are compared with respect to melting point, viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In addition, the differences between blocked and unblocked TAAILs with regard to their electrochemical reduction potentials are investigated by quantum chemical methods.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in Platinum Indolylphosphine Polyfluorido and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tune it! Platinum fluorido and polyfluorido complexes stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen were synthesized. X&#8208;ray data suggest a lower trans influence for electron withdrawing aryl ligands in the para position to the fluoride, but simultaneously a larger cis influence was observed, which is mirrored by the 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants. The |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants were found to be smaller for fluorido complexes when compared to polyfluorido complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of the Pt complexes cis&#8208;[Pt(CH3)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (Ind=2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolyl, Ar=4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (1&#8201;a), 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (1&#8201;b), Ph (1&#8201;c), 4&#8208;FC6H4 (1&#8201;d), 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (1&#8201;e), 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (1&#8201;f)) with HF afforded the polyfluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F(HF)2)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] 2&#8201;a&#8211;f, which can be converted into the fluoride derivatives trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (3&#8201;a&#8211;f) by treatment with CsF. The compounds 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2&#8201;a&#8211;f show larger |1J(F,Pt)|, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776;4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b)&lt;Ph (c)&#8810;4&#8208;FC6H4 (d)&lt;4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e)&lt;4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants. The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.

         <title>Separation of Tellurium from Metal Chalcogenides through Mild Anhydrous Chlorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photovoltaic waste: The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol. This procedure also proved to give a significant separation of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium from a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides.







Abstract
The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation of the subsequent tellurium tetrachloride with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholate ligands (dtbc). The resulting tellurium complex, Te(dtbc)2, is isolated in moderate yield and features a 103 to 104 reduction in cadmium content, as provided by XRF and ICP&#8208;MS analysis. Similar results were obtained from zinc telluride. A significant separation between Te, Se, and S was observed after treating a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides with this protocol. These three tunable steps can be applied for future applications of CdTe photovoltaic waste.

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasing the base pairing partner: A pyridone C&#8208;nucleoside is reported that binds very tightly to adenine as complementary base. Upon exposure to soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione or selenocysteine, the new base reacts and releases its grip on the base pairing partner, allowing for the dissociation of duplexes. At the same time, the C&#8208;nucleoside changes its fluorescence signature, providing a visual signal for the transformation.







Abstract
Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.

Due to its reactivity toward &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large increase in lipophilicity is observed for CH2/CF2 replacement in the center of di&#8208;functional compounds. The increase, in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units is for most cases, far above expected values. The effect is nearly additive, thus one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one using a limited number of H/F exchanges. In this paper, the effect and its origins are explored.







Abstract
Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log P(CF2&#8208;CH2) values, that is, the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH2/CF2 replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational preference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.

Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids (Han et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8208;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486&#8197;nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623&#8197;nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions.

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2 Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic states affect the adsorption of intermediates. A key discovery is TMB3s, which are highly intrinsic active, stable, and have a large number of active sites for intrinsic electrocatalysis. More importantly, the role of TMBs in NRR with rich magnetic states is investigated. Among them, different magnetic states have different adsorption strengths for NRR intermediates, while there is no effect on the activation of nitrogen, making TMB3 a catalyst for NRR that is magnetically stable.







Abstract
Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2 and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3 is identified as a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8722;0.24&#8197;V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2 and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2. Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3 monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2 electroreduction. This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescent metal halide nanoclusters have been described for tunable photodynamic therapy. Modulating the short chain fatty acid length on the apical halide ligand of phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum&#8208;based nanoclusters facilitates cellular uptake and improves phototoxicity in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Following photoexcitation, the nanoclusters produce singlet oxygen to cause cancer cell death. Image created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species. Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability between their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.

Structure&#8211;activity Relationships in Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Vectors Based on Peptidic Dynamic Covalent Polymers (M. Barboiu, N. Bettache, S. Ulrich et&#8197;al.), @DDSU0407; @M_Cste; @MihailBarboiu; @IBMM_Balard







Abstract
The use of nucleic acids as templates, which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Herein, the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines were studied. The combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA, are described. Finally, a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells was identified.

         <title>Enantiomeric Resolution and Enantiomer Isolation of H2TPPS4&#8197;J&#8208;aggregate from Aqueous Solution is Enabled by Vortexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric vortices induce the selective deposition of J&#8208;aggregates from a corresponding racemic mixture allowing to isolate and recover the single J&#8208;aggregate enantiomer separated.







Abstract
Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favored by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favored chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.

         <title>The Transformation of Inorganic to Organic Carbonates: Chasing for Reaction Pathways in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate by mechanochemistry starting from inorganic carbonates is used as target system to light up the &#8216;black box&#8217; with its heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. The complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveals the underlying reaction pathways and intermediates.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions are solvent&#8208;free alternatives to solution&#8208;based syntheses enabling even conventionally impossible transformations. Their reaction pathways, however, usually remain unexplored within the heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. Here, we showcase how the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate is synthesized mechanochemically from inorganic alkali carbonates and how the complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveal the underlying reaction pathways. With this, reaction intermediates are identified, and chemical concepts of solution&#8208;chemistry are challenged or corroborated for mechanochemistry.

         <title>Base&#8208;stabilized Neutral Oxoborane and Thioxoborane Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Base&#8208;stabilized neutral oxoborane and thioxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While previous synthetic attempts of oxoborane ligated by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (NacNac) did not allow for its isolation in acid&#8208;free form, oxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand is isolable, due to the absence of imine &#593;&#8208;protons and steric protection of enamine carbon. Crystallographic analysis revealed the presence of a B&#8211;O double bond close to the shortest end of the reported lengths. Its reactivity has also been examined, and it was majorly governed by the nucleophilicity and basicity of the oxygen atom. The chemical inertness and synthetic convenience of the bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide scaffold presented in this work suggest its utility as an innocent alternative to the NacNac scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Site Isolated in a Pentanuclear Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Lowry acids and bases is long and widely recognized as the most reasonable theory to explain the behavior of H+ ions. Here, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair that does not follow this theory. Two heteronuclear metal complexes, in which Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites are sterically isolated, were synthesized and characterized. These sterically isolated sites exhibited anomalous behavior, wherein the H+ species encapsulated in the Br&#248;nsted acid site did not undergo a deprotonation reaction, and the corresponding protonation reaction at the Br&#248;nsted base site failed to proceed. As a result, two states that are in a relationship of a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base pair stably exist over a wide pH range without any interconversion, generating a thermodynamically metastable state. Additionally, these two states exhibited distinct electron transfer abilities and reactivities. The system presented in this study is in sharp contrast with the traditional concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Lowry acids and bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs): Synthesis, Crystallization, and Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface areas, all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen-rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface areas, all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confinement of Assemblies of Peptides by Chemical Reactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of peptides plays an important role in optics, catalysis, medicine, and disease treatment. In recent years, peptide&#8208;based materials have exhibited great potential for cancer therapy and disease imaging due to their excellent biocompatibility, structural tenability, and ease of functionality. Peptides could self&#8208;assemble into diverse nanostructures in vivo triggered by endogenous stimuli, which initiated chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembled to achieve desired biological functions in the tumor microenvironment. This concept introduces the utilization of endogenous triggers to construct functional nanostructures in vivo and their corresponding biological applications. After briefly discussing the representative example of chemical reactions induced self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the living system, we describe the several stimuli triggered self&#8208;assembly for constructing therapeutic assemblies and serving as an imaging probe. Finally, we give a brief outlook to discuss the future direction of this exciting new field.</dc:description>

         <title>Two rings around one ball: Stability and charge localization of [1:1] and [2:1] complex ions of [10]CPP and C60/70[*]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C60 and C70 by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature&#8208;known [1:1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C60 and [10]CPP&#8835;C70, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy&#8208;resolved collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ER&#8208;CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C70 core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C60 or C70, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2:1] complexes of the ([10]CPP2&#8835;C60/70) + &#8226; / &#8722;&#8226; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas&#8208;phase species. Here, C60&#8208;based [2:1] complexes are less stable than the respective C70 analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1:1] complexes, [2:1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas&#8208;phase [2:1] complexes are also found in 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Selectively Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive and high&#8208;cost thermocatalytic hydrogenation. However, the systematic summary on the electrocatalysts and electrolyzers remains lacked. Herein, we demonstrate a comprehensive review about recent achievements in the electrocatalysts including noble metal and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal materials. Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity e.g., accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chelate Effect Rationalizes Observed Rate Acceleration and Enantioselectivity in BINOL&#8208;Catalyzed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density Functional Theory calculations afforded insight into the origin of the reaction rate acceleration (&#8805;500 fold) and enantioselectivity (&#8805;99% ee) of BINOL&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component Petasis reactions observed experimentally. BINOL accelerates the rate determining step by forming a B(IV) chelate, which involves the loss of water from the hemiaminal moiety to generate an iminium cation. Subsequent vinyl group transfer from B(IV) to the iminium carbon affords the enantiomerically enriched product and a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL complex, which rapidly releases the BINOL allowing it to re&#8208;enter the catalytic cycle. In the transition state of the vinyl transfer step, C&#8722;H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O hydrogen bonding between the iminium C&#8722;H and O of (R)&#8208;BINOL directs the vinyl group addition to the Re&#8208;face of the iminium carbon. This mechanism explains both the rate acceleration and high enantioselectivity of the stereo determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential C&#8722;H Methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;Dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme, TokK catalyzes consecutive methylation reactions on a pantetheinylated carbapenem substrate. A stepwise &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; radical transfer mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, then methylcobalamin donates a methyl group to the substrate. The calculations can uncover the origin of the observed chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
TokK is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin&#8197;A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8208;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, calculations were able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK could have profound implications for studying other B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.

More importantly, calculations were able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK could have profound implications for studying other B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent radical SAM enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of ~61% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoid conjugated polymer nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak toward efficient photothermal therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000 nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026 nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064 nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Chloride Corrosion by Controlling the Morphologies of PtNi Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Corrosion control: A PtNi alloy with a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles is described. The unique morphology of the PtNi alloy facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances its resistance to chloride corrosion and performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen production in seawater.







Abstract
A solvothermal method to prepare PtNi alloys that have differing morphologies is described. By adjusting the feed ratio of Pt and Ni precursors in this process, PtNi alloys with different compositions (Pt&#8201;:&#8201;Ni atomic ratio from 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1) and morphologies (evolution from nanobranches to nanoparticles) are generated. The prepared Pt48Ni52 alloy, which has a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles, exhibits superior activity and durability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and other PtNi alloys that have different compositions and morphologies. The excellent seawater HER performance of Pt48Ni52 is ascribed to its nanobranch/nanoparticle morphology that optimally facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances resistance to chloride corrosion in seawater.

         <title>Bright Organic Mechanoluminescence and Remarkable Mechanofluorochromism from Circularly Polarized TADF Enantiomers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of organic enantiomers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties have been developed successfully. Furthermore, it is found that their crystals can emit strong blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence and produce bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence and remarkable mechanofluorochromism under the stimuli of force.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) luminogens with stimuli&#8208;response characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a pair of organic enantiomers, S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, have been successfully developed by introducing chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene and carbazole to phthalimide. They present CP&#8208;TADF properties in toluene solutions, giving dissymmetric factors of 0.84&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;1.03&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. In the crystalline state, both S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA can emit intense blue TADF and produce very bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence (ML) and remarkable mechanofluorochromism (MFC) under the stimuli of mechanical force. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and theoretical calculation results suggest that their ML activities are probably associated with their chiral and polar molecular structures and unique non&#8208;centrosymmetric molecular packing modes. Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP&#8208;TADF materials with force&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP-TADF materials with force-stimuli-responsive properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction&#8208;Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powerful sensing and imaging abilities: This review highlights the recent advances in closed bipolar electrode (BPE) arrays using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction to realize sensing and imaging. It demonstrates the advantages of a closed BPE array, such as the physical separation of two poles, the independence of each electrode, and the simplicity and controllability of the system.







Abstract
This review centers on a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments in closed BPE array&#8208;based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we consider the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of closed BPE array&#8208;based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

This work reports the homogeneous incorporation of Co into the FeP host to promote both activity and stability of HER for the PEMWE application and demonstrates the probable origin of the high performance by ex situ experiments.







Abstract
Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M=Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67&#8197;mV and 129&#8197;mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10&#8197;h stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.

         <title>Comparative Screening of DalPhos/Ni Catalysts in C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;couplings of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides Enables Development of Aminopyrazole Cross&#8208;couplings with Amine Base</title>

         <dc:description>
A competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings involving a diverse set of test nucleophiles, electrophiles, solvents, and bases enabled the development of the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of aminopyrazoles and related heteroatom&#8208;dense nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides using an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.







Abstract
A systematic competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation chemistry is reported, involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.&#8201;g., unwanted C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.

         <title>Modulating the G&#8208;Quadruplex and Duplex DNA Binding by Controlling the Charge of Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules being either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged have been investigated as DNA binders. Both molecules show a moderate binding to G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA structures whereas the interaction is governed by the overall charge of the ligands.







Abstract
Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules bearing either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged moieties attached to the same aromatic structure have been investigated as binders for DNA. The novel Spiro&#8208;NMe3 containing four alkylammonium substituents interacts with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and shows preference for G4s over duplex by means of FRET melting and fluorescence experiments. The interaction is governed by the charged substituents of the ligands as deduced from the lower binding of the sulfonate analogue (Spiro&#8208;SO3). On the contrary, Spiro&#8208;SO3 exhibits higher binding affinity to duplex DNA structure than to G4. Both molecules show a moderate quenching of the fluorescence upon DNA binding. The confocal microscopy evaluation shows the internalization of both molecules in HeLa cells and their lysosomal accumulation.

         <title>Synthesis of Isomeric Tb3+&#8208;Phthalocyanine Double&#8208;Decker Complexes Depending on the Difference in the Direction of Coordination Plane and Their Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine was employed to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes. (S,S), (R,R), and meso isomers were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of the two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. It was demonstrated that the meso isomer showed higher energy for spin reversal (Ueff) than those of the enantiomers (S,S and R,R).







Abstract
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22&#8208;tertrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;oxy)phthalocyanine (H2TdMPPc), was used to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)2]s). Because H2TdMPPc has C4h symmetry, S,S, R,R, and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)2] isomers, including their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier (Ueff) of the meso isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomers. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the meso isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher Ueff of the meso isomer originated from the more highly symmetrical structure.

&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;4&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;symmetrically substituted&lt;/b&gt; phthalocyanine was employed to synthesize Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-phthalocyanine double-decker complexes. (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomers were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of the two &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. It was demonstrated that the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomer showed higher energy for spin reversal (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) than those of the enantiomers (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;).

&lt;/sub&gt; symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22-tertrakis(2,4-dimethylpent-3-oxy)phthalocyanine (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TdMPPc), was used to synthesize Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-phthalocyanine double-decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]s). Because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TdMPPc has &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] isomers, including their single-ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin-reversal energy barrier (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) of the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomers. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; isomer originated from the more highly symmetrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Methyl Heteroarenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was first reported. A series of di&#8208;heteroaryl ketones (26 examples) were obtained in moderate yields (up to 72&#8201;% yield), providing a highly atom&#8208;economic approach for synthesizing complex pharmaceutical intermediates from small molecules. A plausible mechanism about cyclic catalysis was proposed and confirmed.







Abstract
Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles is reported. A variety of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yields (up to 72&#8201;%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers Toward Amines Oxidation Coupled with H2O2 Generation via Extending Monomer's Conjugation Degree</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light driven amines oxidation coupled with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation is a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) photocatalysts with different arenes monomers, including benzene (BE), diphenyl (DP), p&#8208;terphenyl (TP), or p&#8208;quaterphenyl (QP), were synthesized via simple Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction. Owing to the maximum monomers&#8217; conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O2) adsorption capacity, QP&#8208;HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation under the irradiation of 455 nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99% of benzylamine could be converted to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine within 60 min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H2O2 was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer&#8217;s conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Ketimines: A Direct Entry to Unprotected &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been developed. This process allows direct access to &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers, which cannot be formed in analogous catalytic reactions. The silyl&#8208;protected carboxylic acid generated from acrylic acid and a hydrosilane indicates a good affinity with CuH catalysis than other alkenes to form the copper enolate dominantly.







Abstract
Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946;&#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. The protocol features in&#8197;situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Ferrocene&#8208;Based Diol Library and Application in the Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a library of ferrocenyl diols, establishing a fundamental structure&#8211;activity relationship through a modular three&#8208;to&#8208;four&#8208;step synthesis is described. These diols are prepared with complete enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity across seven chiral elements (2 planes, 2 centres, and 3 axes) and are catalytically active in the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography shows intricate inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as uncommon bifurcated hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Diol scaffolds have been utilized as highly effective catalysts and ligands in a wide range of catalytic asymmetric transformations. For scaffolds to be successful as broadly used motifs, they should be prepared cheaply through facile routes and be easily handled. Herein, the synthesis of a family of planar chiral diols based on a modular and robust three&#8208;step route is described, which yields catalytically active diols in &gt;99&#8201;% de and &gt;99&#8201;% ee, with up to seven different chiral elements. These diols have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which provides clear evidence for the likely transition state when applied in the asymmetric hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Without altering the stereochemistry of the catalyst backbone, it is possible to access both enantiomers of the product by varying the substitution of the catalyst at the &#945;&#8208;position.

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trifunctional probe consisting of a chlorooxime, a bromine mass tag, and a UV tag facilitated the detection, isolation, and structure elucidation of isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products in microgram quantities in cyanobacteria and a rare marine sponge.







Abstract
Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used the isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua and a marine sponge of the order Bubarida, respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.

         <title>Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes by Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to shrink the ring: Amino&#8208;functionalized phosphabenzenes can undergo a selective and quantitative ring contraction reaction to give phospholene derivatives. The special electronic properties of the aromatic phosphorus heterocycles, in combination with their particular reactivity, allow sequential reactions, in contrast to functionalized pyridines.







Abstract
A 3&#8208;amino&#8208;functionalized phosphabenzene (phosphinine) has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The pyramidalized nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino substituent indicates only a weak interaction between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom and the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle, resulting in somewhat basic character. It turned out that the amino group can indeed be protonated by HCl. In contrast to pyridines, however, the phosphabenzene&#8208;ammonium salt undergoes a selective ring contraction to form a hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of additional water. Based on deuterium labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, a rational mechanism for this hitherto unknown conversion is proposed.

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable novel synthesis of food waste conversion into molybdenum carbide samples for improved solar evaporation performances.







Abstract
Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is regarded as a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a facile two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has an efficient water evaporation rate of 1.52&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation, which is among the best reported values so far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity, of the Mo2C photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.

         <title>Chiral All&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Coordinated Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>

Integration of Dy(III) hexaazamacrocycle, azido and chirality produces the first chiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Dy&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
Two pairs of chiral end&#8208;on azido&#8208;bridged dinuclear hexaazamacrocycles, [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)2Cl2](BPh4)2 (1R/1S) and [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)4]Cl2 (2R/2S) (LN6R/S is hexaazamacrocyclic neutral Schiff base ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine and (1R, 2R)/(1S, 2S)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane), were constructed by adjusting the molar ratio of sodium azide to Dy(III) macrocycle precursor. Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes 1R/1S and 2R/2S are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between 1R/1S and 2R/2S are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex 2S displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas 1S just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field. Significantly, complex 2R/2S represents the first homochiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnet.

         <title>Rapid 18F&#8208; and 19F&#8208;Difluoromethylation through Desulfurative Fluorination of Transient N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208;Linked Dithioles</title>

         <dc:description>
New opportunities for radiochemists: The AgF&#8208;promoted desulfurative fluorination of dithioles can lead to difluoromethylation. DMBDT&#8208;BF4 and DMBDT&#8208;OMe were identified as readily available and versatile reagents for the functionalization of alcohols and heterocycles during which DMBDT undergoes rapid desulfurative fluorination. Furthermore, Ag18F can be used to incorporate radioactive groups into structurally complex and pharmaceutically relevant molecules.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl group plays an important role in modern medicinal and agrochemistry. While several difluoromethylation reagents have been reported, these typically rely on difluoromethyl carbenes or anions, or target specific processes. Here, we describe a conceptually unique and general process for O&#8722;H, N&#8722;H and C&#8722;H difluoromethylation that involves the formation of a transient dithiole followed by facile desulfurative fluorination using silver(I) fluoride. We also introduce the 5,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole (DMBDT) function, which undergoes sufficiently rapid desulfurative fluorination to additionally support 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation. This new process is compatible with the wide range of functional groups typically encountered in medicinal chemistry campaigns, and the use of Ag18F is demonstrated in the production of 18F&#8208;labeled derivatives of testosterone, perphenazine, and melatonin, 58.0&#177;2.2, 20.4&#177;0.3 and 32.2&#177;3.6&#8197;MBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1, respectively. We expect that the DMBDT group and this 18F/19F&#8208;difluoromethylation process will inspire and support new efforts in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and radiotracer production.

         <title>Modular Peptide Probe for Protein Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular peptide probes with good selectivity and high affinity have attracted numerous attentions for the analysis and regulation of proteins with complex structure and complicated analytical environment. In this review, the design and optimization strategies of modular peptide probes and their research progress of their applications in the field of protein analysis are reviewed.







Abstract
The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Nowadays, ascribing to the editability and bioactivity of peptides, peptide&#8208;based probes could meet the requirements of good selectivity and high affinity to overcome the challenges. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the strategies and application to improve the analysis result of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the construction of chiral foldamers and their chiroptical properties. Fabrication, properties and application of the rotatable folded systems with respect to the generation of axial chirality, the regulation of folding behavior and the evolution of chiroptical properties are illustrated. Furthermore, the applications of chiral foldamers in optical chirality sensing and asymmetric synthesis are briefly introduced.







Abstract
Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of a specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which broadly exist in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely &#8220;foldamer&#8221;, exhibiting potentials in pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when chirality transfer, amplification, evolution, and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of the structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford a parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. This concept aims to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. Design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dare to be bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH): While the iron catalysts are susceptible to hydrolytic dissociation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide, [MoxOy]n&#8722; cluster ions, in&#8197;situ derived from a small isolable {31} atom containing Anderson polyoxometalate ([Mo7O24]6&#8722;), protect a &lt;10&#8197;nm iron&#8208;oxide nanocore in water. The POM clusters prevent the spontaneous aggregation of the iron oxy&#8208;hydroxide nanocore making the core highly reactive for electrochemical water&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis&#8208;induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#8208;type [Mo7O24]6&#8722; isopolyanion, a small (dimension ca. 0.85&#8197;nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may lead to the in&#8197;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8722; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8722;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#956;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidence. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions in Halogenated Pyridinium Salts of the Weakly Coordinating Anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and structural characterization of the perhalogenated pyridinium cations [C5F5NH]+ and [C5F4ClNH]+ and the dimeric cations [(C5F5N)2H]+ and [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ as [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; salts are presented. These cations show noncovalent interactions with the weakly coordinating anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; such as strong fluorine specific interactions as well as &#963;&#8208;hole and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis and the first structural characterization of the halogenated pyridinium salts [C5F5NH]+, [C5F4ClNH]+, [(C5F5N)2H]+, [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;, showing noncovalent interactions in the solid state, are presented. The salts were characterized by the multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. Hirshfeld surface analysis and solid state structures reveal various intermolecular anion&#8208;&#960; and &#963;&#8208;hole interactions between the corresponding halogenated pyridinium cations and the anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and the first structural characterization of the halogenated pyridinium salts [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ClNH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [Al(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, showing noncovalent interactions in the solid state, are presented. The salts were characterized by the multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Hirshfeld surface analysis and solid state structures reveal various intermolecular anion-&#960; and &#963;-hole interactions between the corresponding halogenated pyridinium cations and the anion [Al(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiroptical Activity of An Achiral Emissive Eu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical activity of achiral crystals is theoretically allowed but very unusual. There is a particularly scarcity of empirical studies on optically active achiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein we report an achiral emissive Eu MOF and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space group (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2), where the asymmetric arrangement of racemic trinuclear Eu&#8208;oxo clusters is responsible for the optical activity. A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals. Importantly, the luminescence dissymmetry factor can reach up to 1.1&#215;10 &#8211; 3, which is comparable in magnitude to the value of most of the chiral&#8208;linker&#8208;bridged MOFs. This work gives the first example of achiral MOFs with CPL response and should be instructive for the discovery of more CPL emitters from racemic MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>IR/UV Double Resonance Study of the 2&#8208;Phenylallyl Radical and its Pyrolysis Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated 2&#8208;phenylallyl radicals (2&#8208;PA), C  9  H  9  , generated by pyrolysis from a nitrite precursor, have been investigated by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy using free electron laser radiation. 2&#8208;PA is a resonance&#8208;stabilized radical that is considered to be involved in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in combustion, but also in interstellar space. The radical is identified based on its gas&#8208;phase IR spectrum. Furthermore, a number of bimolecular reaction products are identified, showing that the self&#8208;reaction as well as reactions with unimolecular decomposition products of 2&#8208;PA form several PAH efficiently. Possible mechanisms are discussed and the chemistry of 2&#8208;PA is compared with the one of the related 2&#8208;methylallyl and phenylpropargyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36 cells&#8226;mL&#8208;1. The nanochannels&#8208;based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular ferromagnetism in di&#8208;nuclear 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal single&#8208;molecule magnets by pseudo&#8208;serial arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New di&#8208;nuclear citrate complexes, [CH6N3]2[M2(citH)2(H2O)4]&#183;2H2O (citH4 = citric acid; M = FeII (Fe&#8208;2), CoII (Co&#8208;2), and NiII (Ni&#8208;2)), are synthesized. The ligand, citH3&#8211;, is deprotonated only at the three carboxy groups, which is different from the previously reported tetra&#8208;nuclear structures with cit4&#8211; ligands. Magnetic measurements reveal that these complexes have intramolecular ferromagnetism with J = ~0 cm&#8211;1 (Ni&#8208;2), 0.02 cm&#8211;1 (Co&#8208;2), and 0.04 cm&#8211;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Co&#8208;2 and Fe&#8208;2 show slow magnetic relaxation, and are field&#8208;induced SMMs with activation energy of spin&#8208;reversal Ueff = 27 cm&#8211;1 (Co&#8208;2) and 4.2 cm&#8211;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the uniaxial anisotropy along the z&#8208;axis of each metal ion center forms the pseudo&#8208;serial&#8208;spin arrangement, leading to intramolecular ferromagnetism via the magnetic dipole interaction. This work demonstrates the creation of ferromagnetic SMMs by the magnetic dipole engineering of 3d di&#8208;nuclear metal ion centers.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by solid&#8208;state method and its MTO Catalytic performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33 h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4 h&#8208;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8208;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were prepared as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins.

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric PVDF&#8208;HFP and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5 V and 200 nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in situ, but also laid the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups are synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150 &#186;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linking and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300 &#186;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic Drugs as a Tool for Protein Structure Solving and Studies on Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic drugs are capable of tight interactions with proteins through coordination towards aminoacidic residues, and this feature is recognized as a key aspect for their pharmacological action. However, the &#8220;protein metalation process&#8221; is exploitable for solving the phase problem and structural resolution. In fact, the use of inorganic drugs bearing specific metal centers and ligands capable to drive the binding towards the desired portions of the protein target could represent a very intriguing and fruitful strategy. In this context, a theoretical approach may further contribute to solve protein structures and their refinement. Here, we delineate the main features of a reliable experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach, based on the use of metallodrugs, for protein structures solving.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;mediated deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (~43, DMSO).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design and Crystal Chemistry of Polyfluorinated Naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides with Superior Thermal and Polymorphic Stability and High Solution Processability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) are highly promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type molecular semiconductor candidates for flexible and cost&#8208;effective organic solar cells and thermoelectrics. Nonetheless, thermal and polymorphic stabilities of environmentally stable NDIs in the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature regime (&lt;300&#176;C) remain challenging properties. Structural, thermal, spectroscopic and computational features of polyfluorinated NDI&#8208;based molecular solids (with up to 14 F atoms per NDI molecule) are discussed upon increasing the fluorination level. Slip&#8208;stacked arrangement of the NDI cores with suitable p&#8211;p stacking and systematically short interplanar distances (&lt; 3.2 &#197;) are found. All these materials exhibit superior thermal stability (up to 260 &#176;C or above) and thermal expansion coefficients indicating a response compatible with flexible polymeric substrates, Optical band&#8208;gaps increase from 2.78 to 2.93 eV with fluorination, while LUMO energy levels decrease down to &#8208;4.37 eV, as per DFT calculations. The compounds exhibit excellent solubility of 30 mg mL&#8208;1 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane and DMF.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As important post&#8208;transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play irreplaceable roles in diverse cellular functions. Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in various diseases including cancers, and thus miRNAs have become the valuable biomarkers for disease monitoring. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has shown great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;sensors because of its precise localization capability, good fidelity, and high cleavage activity.

         <title>Direct observation of charge, energy and H transfer between backbone and nucleobases in isolated DNA oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how charge and energy as well as protons and hydrogen atoms are transferred in molecular systems as a result of an electronic excitation is fundamental for understanding the interaction between ionizing radiation and biological matter on the molecular level. In order to localize the excitation at the atomic scale, we have chosen to target phosphorus atoms in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The combination of absorption site selectivity and photoproduct sensitivity allowed the identification of X&#8208;ray spectral signatures of specific processes. Moreover, charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases has been directly observed. While the probability of one vs. two H transfer following valence ionization depends on the nucleobase, ionization of sugar or phosphate groups at the carbon K&#8208;edge or the phosphorus L&#8208;edge mainly leads to single H transfer to protonated adenine. Moreover, our results indicate a surprising proton transfer process to specifically form protonated guanine after excitation or ionization of P 2p electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;fluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and poly&#8208; fluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E'&#8209;BH2&#8208;NMe3 (E' = P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E&#160;=&#160;P, As; R1 = H, R2 = tBu; R1 = R2 = Ph; M = Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8209;crown&#8208;6)][H2E'&#8209;BH2&#8209;EHtBu] (3: E = E' = P; 4: E = E' = As; 5: E = As, E' = P) and [M(C)][H2E'&#8209;BH2&#8209;EPh2] (7: E = E' = P, M = Na, C = 18&#8209;crown&#8208;6; 8: E = E' = As; M = K, C = [2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E = P, E' = As, M = Na, C = [2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E = As, E' = P, M = K, C = [2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8209;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8209;BH2&#8209;tBuPH&#8208;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8226;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8209;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8209;BH2&#8208;EPh2] (11: E = P, M = Na; 12: E = As, M = K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8209;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9' (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8209;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E'&#8209;BH2&#8209;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8209;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8209;BH2&#8208;R1R2P&#8208;BH2&#8208;E'H2] (E = E' = P, R1 = H, R2 = tBu (13); E = E' = P, R1 = R2 = Ph (14); E = E' = As, R1 = R2 = Ph (15); E = P, E' = As, R1 = R2 = Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7 cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7 cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360 &#177; 170 ps) as compared to in DMSO (~ 960 ps) at 600 nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced reaction processes in functional dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohols as efficient intermolecular initiators for a highly stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of benzylic and allylic alcohols in HFIP solvent together with Ti(OiPr)4 has been shown to trigger a highly stereoselective polyene cyclization cascade. Three new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are made during the process and complete stereocontrol of up to five new stereogenic centers is observed. The reaction is efficient, has high functional group tolerance and is atom&#8211;economic generating water as a stoichiometric by&#8211;product. A new polyene substrate&#8211;class is employed, and subsequent mechanistic studies indicate a stereoconvergent mechanism. The products of this reaction can be used to synthesise steroid&#8211;analogues in a single step</dc:description>
