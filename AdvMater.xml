         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin within 2D Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D sub&#8208;nanoconfined annealed graphene oxide membranes are constructed for efficient synthesis of aspirin in directional flow. The reaction shows &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented short reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculation indicates the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure plays an important role in the efficient reaction.








Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Terahertz Liquid Biosensor Based on A Graphene Metasurface for Ultrasensitive Detection with A Quasi&#8208;Bound State in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of metasurface with graphene, which enables liquid detection. The study opens new avenues for the advancement of metasurfaces by establishing them as potent candidates for optical sensors with real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free capabilities.








Abstract
The concept of a quasi&#8208;bound state in a continuum (QBIC) has garnered significant attention in various fields such as sensing, communication, and optical switching. Within metasurfaces, QBICs offer a reliable platform that enables sensing capabilities through potent interactions between local electric fields and matter. Herein, a novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of QBIC with graphene is reported, which enables multidimensional detection. The proposed biosensor is distinctive because of its ability to discern concentrations of ethanol and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone in a wide range from 100% to 0%, by monitoring the changes in the resonance intensity and maximum wavelet coefficient. This approach demonstrates an excellent linear fit, which ensures robust quantitative analysis. The remarkable sensitivity of our biosensor enables it to detect minute changes in low&#8208;concentration solutions, with the lowest detection concentration value (LDCV) of 0.21&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1. 2D wavelet coefficient intensity cards are effectively constructed through continuous wavelet transforms, which presents a more accurate approach for determining the concentration of the solution. Ultimately, the novel sensing platform offers a host of advantages, including heightened sensitivity and reusability. This pioneering approach establishes a new avenue for liquid&#8208;based terahertz biosensing.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.








Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

         <title>Modulation of Phase Transition in Cobalt Selenide with Simultaneous Construction of Heterojunctions for Highly&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt selenide&#8208;cobalt nitride (CoSe2&#8208;CoN) heterojunction is obtained via a simultaneous phase/interface engineering strategy. Co sites at the CoSe2&#8208;CoN interface serve as the main catalytic centers for optimizing adsorption energies for intermediates. The delocalized electronic state of CoN assists the formation of an electron&#8208;rich state over the CoSe2&#8208;CoN interface, thus lowering energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining steps to promote oxygen&#8208;electrocatalysis activity.








Abstract
Phase transformation of cobalt selenide (CoSe2) can effectively modulate its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. However, enhancing electroconductivity and catalytic activity/stability of CoSe2 still remains challenging. Heterostructure engineering may be feasible to optimize interfacial properties to promote the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis on a CoSe2&#8208;based catalyst. Herein, a heterostructure consisting of CoSe2 and cobalt nitride (CoN) embedded in a hollow carbon cage is designed via a simultaneous phase/interface engineering strategy. Notably, the phase transition of orthorhombic&#8208;CoSe2 to cubic&#8208;CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) accompanied by in situ CoN formation is realized to build the c&#8208;CoSe2/CoN heterointerface, which exhibits excellent/highly stable activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Notably, heterostructure can modulate the local coordination environment and increase Co&#8208;Se/N bond lengths. Theoretical calculations show that Co&#8208;site (c&#8208;CoSe2) with an electronic state near Fermi energy level is the main active site for ORR/OER.Energetical tailoring of the d&#8208;orbital electronic structure of the Co atom of c&#8208;CoSe2 in heterostructure by in situ CoN incorporation lowers thermodynamic barriers for ORR/OER. Attractively, a zinc&#8208;air battery with a c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;CoN cathode displays excellent cycling stability (250&#160;h) and charge/discharge voltage loss (0.953/0.96&#160;V). It highlights that heterointerface engineering provides an option for modulating the bifunctional activity of metal selenides with controlled phase transformation.

         <title>Nanodiamond&#8208;Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of paramagnetic centers in nanodiamonds drives effective reduction in longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and relaxation of neighboring water molecules, resulting in bright appearance on T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance images. , Using in vivo chicken embryos, it is confirmed nanodiamonds can provide high contrast to noise ratio for tracking and cell labeling over periods of time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
Nanodiamonds (ND) hold great potential for diverse applications due to their biocompatibility, non&#8208;toxicity, and versatile functionalization. Direct visualization of ND by means of non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques will open new venues for labeling and tracking, offering unprecedented and unambiguous detection of labeled cells or nanodiamond&#8208;based drug carrier systems. The structural defects in diamonds, such as vacancies, can have paramagnetic properties and potentially act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The smallest nanoscale diamond particles, detonation ND, are reported to effectively reduce longitudinal relaxation time T1 and provide signal enhancement in MRI. Using in vivo, chicken embryos, direct visualization of ND is demonstrated as a bright signal with high contrast to noise ratio. At 24 h following intravascular application marked signal enhancement is noticed in the liver and the kidneys, suggesting uptake by the phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and in vivo labeling of these cells. This is confirmed by visualization of nanodiamond&#8208;labeled macrophages as positive (bright) signal, in vitro. Macrophage cell labeling is not associated with significant increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines or marked cytotoxicity. These results indicate nanodiamond as a novel gadolinium&#8208;free contrast&#8208;enhancing agent with potential for cell labeling and tracking and over periods of time.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets Constructed Hierarchical Water Transport Biological Channel for High&#8208;Performance Interfacial Seawater Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar interfacial water evaporation shows great potential to address the global freshwater scarcity. As water evaporation is inherently energy intensive, Joule&#8208;heating assisted solar evaporation for addressing the insufficient vapor under natural conditions is an ideal strategy. However, the simultaneous optimisation of low evaporation enthalpy, high photothermal conversion and excellent Joule&#8208;heating steam generation within a single material remains a rare achievement. Herein, inspired by the biological channel structures, we elaboratively design a large&#8208;area film with hierarchical macro/microporous structures by stacking the nanosheet of a conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Ni3(HITP)2, on a paper substrate. By combining the above three features in one material, the water evaporation enthalpy reduces from 2455 J g&#8722;1 to 1676 J g&#8722;1, and the photothermal conversion efficiency increases from 13.75% to 96.25%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar interfacial water evaporation shows great potential to address the global freshwater scarcity. As water evaporation is inherently energy intensive, Joule-heating assisted solar evaporation for addressing the insufficient vapor under natural conditions is an ideal strategy. However, the simultaneous optimisation of low evaporation enthalpy, high photothermal conversion and excellent Joule-heating steam generation within a single material remains a rare achievement. Herein, inspired by the biological channel structures, we elaboratively design a large-area film with hierarchical macro/microporous structures by stacking the nanosheet of a conductive metal-organic framework (MOF), Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, on a paper substrate. By combining the above three features in one material, the water evaporation enthalpy reduces from 2455 J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1676 J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the photothermal conversion efficiency increases from 13.75% to 96.25%. Benefiting from the synergistic photothermal and Joule-heating effects, the evaporation rate achieves 2.60&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1 sun plus input electrical power of 4&#160;W, surpassing the thermodynamic limit and marking the highest reported value in MOF-based evaporators. Moreover, Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-paper exhibits excellent long-term stability in simulated seawater, where no salt crystallization and evaporation rate degradationare observed. This design strategy for nanosheet films with hierarchical macro/microporous channels provides inspiration for electronics, biological devices, and energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticle Reporters for High&#8208;Precision Urinalysis of in Situ Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The expression of disease&#8208;specific membrane proteins (MPs) is a crucial indicator for evaluating the onset and progression of diseases. Urinalysis of in situ MPs has the potential for point&#8208;of&#8208;care disease diagnostics, yet remains challenging due to the lack of molecular reporter to transform the expression information of in situ MPs into the measurable urine composition. Herein, a series of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) are employed as the cores of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) to direct the self&#8208;assembly of PAN reporters with defined ligand valence and spatial distribution. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and MPs exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under renal tubule&#8208;mimic fluid microenvironment, thus enabling high&#8208;fidelity conversion of MPs expression level into binding events and reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measurement of the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters. Such PAN reporter&#8208;mediated signal transformation mechanism empowers urinalysis of the onset of acute kidney injury at least 6&#8201;h earlier than the existing methods with an area under the curve of 100%. This strategy has the potential for urinalysis of a variety of in situ membrane proteins.

         <title>Endogenous Zinc Ion&#8208;Triggered In&#8208;Situ Gelation Enables Zn Capture to Reprogramme Benign Hyperplastic Prostate Microenvironment and Shrink Prostate</title>

Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the leading cause of urination disorder is still a refractory disease, and there have no satisfied drugs or treatment protocols yet. With identifying excessive Zn2+, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the etiology of aberrant hyperplasia, an injectable sodium alginate (SA) &amp; glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogels (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ gelation have been developed to load lonidamine for reprogramming prostate microenvironment and treating BPH. Herein, SAGA hydrogels can crosslink with Zn2+ in BPH via coordination chelation and switch free Zn2+ to bound ones, consequently alleviating Zn2+&#8208;arised inflammation and glycolysis. Beyond capturing Zn2+, GA with intrinsic immunoregulatory property can also alleviate local inflammation and scavenge ROS. Intriguingly, Zn2+ chelation&#8208;bridged interconnection in SAGA enhances its mechanical property and regulates the degradation rate to enable continuous lonidamine release, favoring hyperplastic acini apoptosis and further inhibiting glycolysis. These multiple actions cooperatively reprogramme BPH microenvironment to alleviate characteristic symptoms of BPH and shrink prostate. RNA sequencing reveals that chemotaxis, glycolysis and TNF inflammation&#8208;related pathways associated with M1&#8208;like phenotype polarization are discerned as the action rationales of such endogenous Zn2+&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ hydrogels, providing a candidate avenue to treat BPH.

         <title>Recent advances in hybrid seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is a promising and potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to hydrogen production, considering that seawater is vastly abundant and SWE is able to combine with offshore renewables producing green hydrogen that can be readily shipped by sea to end users. However, SWE has long been suffering from technical challenges including mainly the high energy demand and the interference of chlorine chemistry, leading electrolyzers to a low efficiency and short lifespan. In this context, hybrid SWE, operated by substituting the energy&#8208;demanding OER and interfering chlorine evolution reaction (CER) with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction (AOR) or by designing innovative electrolyzer cells, has recently emerged as a better alternative, which not only allows SWE to occur in a safe and energy&#8208;saving manner without the notorious CER, but also enables co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals or elimination of environmental pollutants. This review provides a first account of recent advances in hybrid SWE for hydrogen production. The substitutional AOR of various small molecules or redox mediators, in couple with hydrogen evolution from seawater, is comprehensively summarized. Moreover, how the electrolyzer cell design helps in hybrid SWE is briefly discussed. Lastly, the current challenges and future outlook about the development of the hybrid SWE technology are outlined

         <title>Non&#8208;epitaxial Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Crystal 2d Materials on Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Next&#8208;generation nanodevices require two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material synthesis on insulating substrates. However, growing high&#8208;quality 2D layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene, on insulators is challenging owing to the lack of suitable metal catalysts, imperfect lattice matching with substrates, and other factors. Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high&#8208;quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies having been explored. Herein, we introduce a universal strategy for the non&#8208;epitaxial synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a non&#8208;adhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the 2D layers to well&#8208;attach onto the insulators. High&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area, single&#8208;crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single&#8208;crystal membrane production.

Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high-quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies having been explored. Herein, we introduce a universal strategy for the non-epitaxial synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a non-adhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high-temperature treatment, thereby pressing the 2D layers to well-attach onto the insulators. High-quality, large-area, single-crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single-crystal membrane production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Targeting Mesenchymal Stem Cells Combined with Photothermal Treatment Attenuate Severe Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current clinical therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of osteo&#8208; and rheumatoid&#8208;arthritis is obviously limited. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as a source of promising regenerative therapy, un&#8208;modified MSCs or genetically engineered MSCs injected in vivo restrict their clinical utility because of the low drug efficacy and unpredicted side effect, respectively. Herein, a strategy to enhance the migration efficacy of MSCs to inflamed joints via an inflammation&#8208;mediated education process was demonstrated. To reinforce the limited anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of MSCs, gold nano&#8208;star loaded with triamcinolone are conjugated to MSC. Furthermore, near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) induced by gold nano&#8208;star significantly elevate the anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy of the developed drugs, even in advanced stage arthritis model. An immunological regulation mechanism study of PTT is first suggested in this study; the expression of the interleukin 22 receptor, implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis, was downregulated in T lymphocytes by PTT, and Th17 differentiation from na&#239;ve CD4 T cell was inhibited. Collectively, inflammation&#8208;targeting MSCs conjugated with triamcinolone&#8208;loaded gold nano&#8208;star promote the repolarization of macrophages and decrease neutrophil recruitment in joints. In addition, Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA significantly alleviate arthritis&#8208;associated pain and improve general locomotor activity, and more importantly, induced cartilage regeneration even for severe stages of arthritis model.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Triggered Gelation of Supramolecular Peptide Nanocoils with Glucose&#8208;Binding Motifs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to prepare functional materials at the nanoscale. Often, the resulting materials have high aspect&#8208;ratio, with intermolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet formation underlying one&#8208;dimensional fibrillar structures. Inspired by dynamic structures in nature, peptide self&#8208;assembly is increasingly moving toward stimuli&#8208;responsive designs wherein assembled structures are formed, altered, or dissipated in response to a specific cue. Herein, a peptide bearing a prosthetic glucose&#8208;binding phenylboronic acid (PBA) is demonstrated to self&#8208;assemble into an uncommon nanocoil morphology. These nanocoils arise from antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, with molecules aligned parallel to the long axis of the coil. The binding of glucose to the PBA motif stabilizes and elongates the nanocoil, driving entanglement and gelation at physiological glucose levels. The glucose&#8208;dependent gelation of these materials is then explored for the encapsulation and release of a therapeutic agent, glucagon, that corrects low blood glucose levels. Accordingly, the release of glucagon from the nanocoil hydrogels is inversely related to glucose level. When evaluated in a mouse model of severe acute hypoglycemia, glucagon delivered from glucose&#8208;stabilized nanocoil hydrogels demonstrate increased protection compared to delivery of the agent alone or within a control nanocoil hydrogel that is not stabilized by glucose.

         <title>&#8220;Soggy&#8208;Sand&#8221; Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrite growth all act to prevent the practical use of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte&#8208;insulator dispersions) with multiple functions have been developed for achieving high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;ion batteries. We reveal how these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes. The oxide additions adsorb water molecules and trap anions, causing a network of space charge layers with increased Zn2+ transference number and reduced interfacial resistance. They beneficially modify the hydrogen bond network and the solvation of Zn2+, thereby influencing the mechanical and electrochemical properties, and causing the Mn2+ in the solution to be oxidized and thus providing additional capacity. As a result, the best performing Al2O3&#8208;based &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolyte exhibits a long&#8208;life of 2500&#160;h and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior in Zn||Zn cells. Furthermore, it increases the charging cut&#8208;off voltage for Zn/MnO2 full cells to 2&#160;V (versus Zn2+/Zn), allowing for an extremely high specific capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 to be attained. Even under practical conditions with a high mass loading of 10 mgMnO2 cm&#8722;2, it yields a promising specific capacity of 189 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The concept of &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; chemistry thus provides a new approach for the design of powerful and universal electrolyte for aqueous batteries.

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings.

     alt="Slippery Porous-Liquid-Infused Porous Surface (SPIPS) with On-Demand Responsive Switching between &#8220;Defensive&#8221; and &#8220;Offensive&#8221; Antifouling Modes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF-8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous-liquid-infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF-8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous-liquid-infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant-releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self-replenishment, self-cleaning, anti-protein, anti-bacterial, anti-algal, and self-healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360-day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Neutrophil Function Conversion Driven by Immune Switchpoint Regulator against Diabetes&#8208;Related Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, tailored to the immune properties of diabetes&#8208;related biofilm infections (DRBIs), an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase&#8208;I@V2C, is cleverly constructed. By virtue of the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activities and physical characteristics, DNase&#8208;I@V2C effectively drives the conversion of neutrophil functions from NETosis to phagocytosis in diabetic microenvironment, leading to complete biofilm clearance. It is expected to provide a viable approach to treat DRBIs.








Abstract
Reinforced biofilm structures and dysfunctional neutrophils induced by excessive oxidative stress contribute to the refractoriness of diabetes&#8208;related biofilm infections (DRBIs). Herein, in contrast to traditional antibacterial therapies, an immune switchpoint&#8208;driven neutrophil immune function conversion strategy based on a deoxyribonuclease I loaded vanadium carbide MXene (DNase&#8208;I@V2C) nanoregulator is proposed to treat DRBIs via biofilm lysis and redirecting neutrophil functions from NETosis to phagocytosis in diabetes. Owing to its intrinsic superoxide dismutase/catalase&#8208;like activities, DNase&#8208;I@V2C effectively scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a high oxidative stress microenvironment to maintain the biological activity of DNase&#8208;I. By increasing the depth of biofilm penetration of DNase&#8208;I, DNase&#8208;I@V2C thoroughly degrades extracellular DNA and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in extracellular polymeric substances, thus breaking the physical barrier of biofilms. More importantly, as an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase&#8208;I@V2C can skew neutrophil functions from NETosis toward phagocytosis by intercepting ROS&#8211;NE/MPO&#8211;PAD4 and activating ROS&#8211;PI3K&#8211;AKT&#8211;mTOR pathways in diabetic microenvironment, thereby eliminating biofilm infections. Biofilm lysis and synergistic neutrophil function conversion exert favorable therapeutic effects on biofilm infections in vitro and in vivo. This study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of effectively achieving DRBIs with high therapeutic efficacy by regulating immune switchpoint to reverse neutrophil functions.

More importantly, as an immune switchpoint regulator, DNase-I@V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C can skew neutrophil functions from NETosis toward phagocytosis by intercepting ROS&#8211;NE/MPO&#8211;PAD4 and activating ROS&#8211;PI3K&#8211;AKT&#8211;mTOR pathways in diabetic microenvironment, thereby eliminating biofilm infections. Biofilm lysis and synergistic neutrophil function conversion exert favorable therapeutic effects on biofilm infections in vitro and in vivo. This study serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of effectively achieving DRBIs with high therapeutic efficacy by regulating immune switchpoint to reverse neutrophil functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Entropy Tape Electrolytes for Compression&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced tape electrolyte is realized by harnessing high&#8208;entropy condensed microstructures of polymers. The high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte brings a promising solution to not only the challenging interface issues in solid&#8208;state batteries, but also future flexible energy storage devices.








Abstract
Advanced solid electrolytes with strong adhesion to other components are the key for the successes of solid&#8208;state batteries. Unfortunately, traditional solid electrolytes have to work under high compression to maintain the contact inside owing to their poor adhesion. Here, a concept of high&#8208;entropy tape electrolyte (HETE) is proposed to simultaneously achieve tape&#8208;like adhesion, liquid&#8208;like ion conduction, and separator&#8208;like mechanical properties. This HETE is designed with adhesive skin layer on both sides and robust skeleton layer in the middle. The significant properties of the three layers are enabled by high&#8208;entropy microstructures which are realized by harnessing polymer&#8211;ion interactions. As a result, the HETE shows high ionic conductivity (3.50 &#177; 0.53 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good mechanical properties (toughness 11.28 &#177; 1.12&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, strength 8.18 &#177; 0.28&#160;MPa), and importantly, tape&#8208;like adhesion (interfacial toughness 231.6 &#177; 9.6 J m&#8722;2). Moreover, a compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape battery is finally demonstrated by adhesion&#8208;based assembling, which shows good interfacial and electrochemical stability even under harsh mechanical conditions, such as twisting and bending. The concept of HETE and compression&#8208;free solid&#8208;state tape batteries may bring promising solutions and inspiration to conquer the interface challenges in solid&#8208;state batteries and their manufacturing.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Responsive Sliver Peroxide&#8208;Nanocarrier Serves as Broad&#8208;spectrum Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase Inhibitor for Combating Severe Pneumonia</title>

Abstract
Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) represent a prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, rendering last&#8208;line carbapenem&#8208;related antibiotics ineffective. Here, a bio&#8208;responsive sliver peroxide (Ag2O2)&#8208;based nanovesicle, named Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, was developed as a broad&#8208;spectrum MBL inhibitor for combating MBL&#8208;producing bacterial pneumonia. Ag2O2 nanoparticle was first orderly modified with bovine serum albumin and polydopamine to co&#8208;load meropenem (MER) and [5&#8208;(p&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;ureido]&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide (TPCA&#8208;1) and then encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) aimed to target inflammatory lung tissue specifically. The resultant Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM effectively abrogated MBL activity by displacing the Zn2+ cofactor with Ag+ in MBLs and displayed potent bactericidal and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, specific targeting abilities, and great bio&#8208;responsive characteristics. After intravenous injection, the nanoparticles accumulated prominently at infection sites through MM&#8208;mediated targeting and acid&#8208;responsive drug release. Ag+ released from Ag2O2 decomposition at the infection sites effectively inhibited MBL activity and overcame the resistance of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria to MER, resulting in synergistic elimination of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria in conjunction with MER. In two murine infection models of NDM&#8208;1+ Klebsiella pneumoniae&#8208;induced severe pneumonia and NDM&#8208;1+ Escherichia coli&#8208;induced sepsis&#8208;related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduced bacterial loading, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. The modality also protected the lungs from severe injury. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL&#8208;producing carbapenem&#8208;resistant bacteria.

         <title>Intelligent Size&#8208;Switchable Iron Carbide&#8208;Based Nanocapsules with Cascade Delivery Capacity for Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Deep Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.








Abstract
The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescence Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophore is synthesized and developed into a water&#8208;soluble activatable probe (CalCL) for in vivo imaging of drug&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has a high prevalence but is poorly managed for cancer patients due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques. Molecular optical imaging can provide a noninvasive way for real&#8208;time monitoring of CIPN; However, this is not reported, likely due to the absence of optical probes capable of imaging deep into the spinal canal and possessing sufficient sensitivity for minimal dosage through local injection into the dorsal root ganglia. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophore (MPBD) with a chemiluminescence quantum yield higher than other reported probes is synthesized and a NIR activatable chemiluminescent probe (CalCL) is developed for in vivo imaging of CIPN. CalCL is constructed by caging MPBD with calpain&#8208;cleavable peptide moiety while conjugating polyethylene glycol chain to endow water solubility. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue penetration of chemiluminescence and specific turn&#8208;on response of CalCL toward calpain (a hallmark of CIPN), it allows for sensitive detection of paclitaxel&#8208;mediated CIPN in living mice, which is unattainable by fluorescence imaging. This study thus not only develops a highly efficient chemiluminescent probe, but also presents the first optical imaging approach toward high&#8208;throughput screening of neurotoxic drugs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

     alt="Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species-Regulated Hydrogel"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS-PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age-related bone injuries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/poly(&#947;-glutamic acid) (&#947;-PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin-loaded poly(diselenide-carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug-loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self-renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS-regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Potassium Metal Batteries Sustained by an Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI</title>

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of biomaterials presenting glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an emerging field. Some of these biomaterials are applied for regenerative medicine but in vivo GAGs are highly diverse. Here, the methods employed to understand the complexity of GAGs are reviewed. High&#8208;throughput methods are focused on comparing multiple parameters in the same experiment.








Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving the understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspective, the scientific community is encouraged to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.

         <title>Specific Propyne Trapping Sites within a Robust MOF for Efficient Propyne/Propadiene Separation with Record Propadiene Productivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust metal organic framework CuZrF6&#8208;TPA with specific propyne trapping sites and multiple supramolecular interactions is reported for benchmark propyne/propadiene separation with record productivity of pure propadiene (4.7 mol L&#8722;1).








Abstract
Separating propyne/propadiene to produce pure propadiene is extremely challenging in industry due to their similar properties. Herein, a novel ZrF62&#8722; anion pillared cage&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (termed as CuZrF6&#8208;TPA) for highly efficient propyne/propadiene separation is reported. It exhibits high propyne capacity (177.4/188.6 cm3/cm3 at 0.5/1.0 bar and 298 K), benchmark separation selectivity (6.0), and remarkable separation potential (5.7 mol L&#8722;1) simultaneously. Record propadiene productivity (&#8776;4.7 mol L&#8722;1) is achieved through a single adsorption process in breakthrough experiments with excellent recycle stability even under humid conditions. Based on the structure of propyne&#8208;loaded single crystals, two binding sites are identified, including a major propyne trapping site at the windows and a minor binding site located in the large cages. Modelling studies further confirm that the contracted cage windows surrounded with rotating Lewis basic F atoms and aromatic rings are the optimal bonding sites to capture propyne with multiple hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Structurally&#8208;Colored Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally-colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra-stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage-free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid-to-solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high-performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate-based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear-free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra-high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid-to-solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short-range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally-colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Reducing Perovskite/C60 Interface Losses via Sequential Interface Engineering for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work implements a sequential interface engineering (SIE) strategy that involves the deposition of ethylenediamine diiodide followed by sequential deposition of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Phenethylammonium chloride on perovskite film. This technique synergistically narrows the conduction band offset and reduces recombination velocity at the perovskite/C60 interface. Based on the SIE strategy, the PCE of 29.6% for a 1&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell is achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells hold tremendous potential for realizing efficient tandem solar cells. However, nonradiative recombination and carrier transport losses occurring at the perovskite/electron&#8208;selective contact (e.g. C60) interface present significant obstacles in approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. To address this, a sequential interface engineering (SIE) strategy that involves the deposition of ethylenediamine diiodide (EDAI2) followed by sequential deposition of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Phenethylammonium chloride (4F&#8208;PEACl) is implemented. The SIE technique synergistically narrows the conduction band offset and reduces recombination velocity at the perovskite/C60 interface. The best&#8208;performing WBG perovskite solar cell (1.67&#160;eV) delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.8% and an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.262&#160;V. Moreover, through integration with double&#8208;textured silicon featuring submicrometer pyramid structures, a stabilized PCE of 29.6% is attained for a 1&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell (certified PCE of 29.0%).

         <title>Deep Learning for Size&#8208;Agnostic Inverse Design of Random&#8208;Network 3D Printed Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected engineered materials whose unprecedented properties originate from their designs at the microscale. Here, deep&#8208;learning techniques are utilized to develop a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that generates numerous microstructures for mechanical metamaterials with predefined elastic properties and dimensions for various applications in high&#8208;tech industries, such as soft robotics and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems aimed at finding microarchitectures that give rise to certain properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific specimen sizes. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture. Such a multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem is formidably difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real&#8208;world applications of mechanical metamaterials. Here, a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that combines four decoupled models is proposed, including two deep learning (DL) models, a deep generative model based on conditional variational autoencoders, and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep&#8208;DRAM integrates these models into a framework capable of finding many solutions to the posed multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem based on random&#8208;network unit cells. Using an extensive set of simulations as well as experiments performed on 3D printed specimens, it is demonstrate that: 1) the predictions of the DL models are in agreement with FE simulations and experimental observations, 2) an enlarged envelope of achievable elastic properties (e.g., rare combinations of double auxeticity and high stiffness) is realized using the proposed approach, and 3) Deep&#8208;DRAM can provide many solutions to the considered multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Compact Micropatterned Chip Empowers Undisturbed and Programmable Drug Addition in High&#8208;Throughput Cell Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized chip, consisting of a micropatterned and porous polymer film, is presented for light&#8208;induced drug addition in cell&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening. The photoisomerization of atom transfer radical polymerization&#8208;grafted azobenzene enables spatial and temporal control, leveraging digital light processing systems to simultaneously regulate and release integrated cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs in numerous droplets with suspended or adhered cells, undisturbed and programmable.








Abstract
Simultaneously adding multiple drugs and other chemical reagents to individual droplets at specific time points presents a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with tiny droplets in high&#8208;throughput screening applications. In this study, a micropatterned polymer chip is developed as a miniaturized platform for light&#8208;induced programmable drug addition in cell&#8208;based screening. This chip incorporates a porous superhydrophobic polymer film with atom transfer radical polymerization reactivity, facilitating the efficient grafting of azobenzene methacrylate, a photoconformationally changeable group, onto the hydrophilic regions of polymer matrix at targeted locations and with precise densities. By employing light irradiation, the cyclodextrin&#8208;azobenzene host&#8211;guest complexes formed on the polymer chip can switch from an &#8220;associated&#8221; to a &#8220;dissociated&#8221; state, granting precise photochemical control over the supramolecular coding system and its surface patterning ability. Significantly, the exceptional spatial and temporal control offered by these chemical transitions empowers to utilize digital light processing systems for simultaneous regulation and release of cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs across numerous droplets containing suspended or adhered cells. This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high&#8208;throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.

         <title>In Situ Growth of High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Crystal Twisted Bilayer Graphene on Liquid Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for single&#8208;crystal TBG with a wide range of twist angles on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, high crystallinity, thermal stability, stacking structure, growth mechanism, and electrical transport properties of as&#8208;grown TBG are investigated. This work provides a convenient avenue for investigating the physical properties of TBG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) generates significant attention in the fundamental research of 2D materials due to its distinct twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent properties. Exploring the efficient production of TBG with a wide range of twist angles stands as one of the major frontiers in moir&#233; materials. Here, the local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal TBG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176; on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, pristine interface, high crystallinity, and thermal stability of TBG are verified by using comprehensive characterization techniques including optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. The proportion of TBG in bilayer graphene reaches as high as 89%. In addition, the stacking structure and growth mechanism of TBG are investigated, revealing that the second graphene layer develops beneath the first one. A series of comparative experiments illustrates that the liquid copper surface, with its excellent fluidity, promotes the growth of TBG. Electrical measurements show the twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent electronic properties of as&#8208;grown TBG, achieving a room&#8208;temperature carrier mobility of 26640 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This work provides an approach for the in situ preparation of 2D twisted materials and facilitates the application of TBG in the fields of electronics.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with &amp;gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TSr and stands among all the state-of-the-art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production from &#8776;0% (above H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to 98.90% (in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water-mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction to controllably produce CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel naked&#8208;eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio&#8208;inspired force&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano&#8208;iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self&#8208;healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.








Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieve its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites, or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device, and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221; is developed. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulates the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel feature fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8776;100&#160;&#181;m), and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10&#8211;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing material capability of sensing patches also ensure their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allows strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which is not yet achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors toward material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction, and smart devices.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultrasmall Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach to enhance the efficiency of photothermal conversion while maintaining the excellent intrinsic catalytic reactivity for ultrasmall Co nanoparticles is demonstrated by integrating the &#8220;nano&#8208;greenhouse effect&#8221; with plasmonic coupling. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies.








Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g., the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, a synergistic strategy is developed for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4 nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol gCo&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

         <title>Micro&#8208;structured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer&#8208;Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities And Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors with superior performances are highly demanded for artificial tactile sensing. Using ionic conductors as the dielectric layer has enabled pressure sensors, termed ionotronic sensors, with high sensitivities owing to the giant capacitance of the electric double layer (EDL) formed at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface. However, conventional ionotronic sensors suffer from leakage, which greatly hinders long&#8208;term stability and practical applications. Herein, we synthesize a leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer as the dielectric layer for ionotronic sensors. We optimize the mechanical and electrical properties of the polyelectrolyte elastomer, construct a micro&#8208;pyramid array, and use it as the dielectric layer for an ionotronic pressure sensor with marked performances. The obtained sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1, a high upper detecting limit on the order of 1&#160;MPa, a fast response/recovery speed of &#8764;6&#160;ms, and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. Notably, the sensor retains a high sensitivity of 4.96 kPa&#8722;1 at 500&#160;kPa, and its broad sensing range within the high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. We demonstrate the applications of the sensor as a wearable keyboard and a quasi&#8208;continuous controller for a robotic arm. Durable and highly sensitive ionotronic sensors potentialize high&#8208;performance artificial skins for soft robots, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and beyond.

         <title>Photo&#8208;annealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in A Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner.</title>

Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. We here present photo&#8208;annealing of living microtissues (PALM) as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics was used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultra&#8208;high throughput, which could be photo&#8208;annealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultra&#8208;high throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Multimodal And Accurate Human&#8211;Machine Interaction System for Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, we developed a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel&#8208;based sensors and a self&#8208;designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multi&#8208;channel electromyographic (EMG) signals, the multimodal human&#8208;machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human&#8208;machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI&#8208;powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.

Compared with traditional multi-channel electromyographic (EMG) signals, the multimodal human-machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human-machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI-powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Peeling&#8208;Stiffening Self&#8208;Adhesive Ionogel with Superhigh Interfacial Toughness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;adhesive materials that can directly adhere to diverse solid surfaces are indispensable in modern life and technologies. However, it remains a challenge to develop self&#8208;adhesive materials with strong adhesion while maintaining its intrinsic softness for efficient tackiness. Here we report a peeling&#8208;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel that reconciles the seemingly contradictory properties of softness and strong adhesion. The ionogel contains two ionophilic repeating units with distinct associating affinities, which allows to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft dissipating state for adhering, and to dramatically stiffen to the glassy state upon peeling. The corresponding modulus increases by 117 times driven by strain rate&#8208;induced phase separation, which greatly suppresses crack propagation and results in a record&#8208;high interfacial toughness of 8046 J m&#8722;2. The self&#8208;adhesive ionogel is also transparent, self&#8208;healable, recyclable, and can be easily removed by simple moisture treatment. Our strategy provides a new way to design high&#8208;performance self&#8208;adhesive materials for intelligent soft devices.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Roughness&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Biodegradable Zn Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) solves the dilemma of significantly improving plasticity at the expense of strength. From the unground state to the 5000# sandpaper ground state, room&#8208;temperature elongation of biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy increases from 74% to 143% without loss of strength. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness.








Abstract
Improving plasticity has been an eternal theme of developing metallic materials. It is difficult to increase room&#8208;temperature elongation of metallic materials over 100% without sacrificing strength using existing methods. Herein, surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) is discovered in biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy. Surprisingly, in the good surface range that meets the international standard ISO 6892, reducing surface roughness results in significant increase in plasticity without loss of strength. From unground to 5000# sandpaper ground states, the surface roughness Ra of the alloy decreases from 0.63 to 0.05&#160;&#181;m, while its room temperature elongation increases from 74% to 143%. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness. It provides a new method for improving plasticity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Stretchable Sensor Arrays Exhibiting Magnetoelasticity for Real&#8208;Time Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor based on a flexible NdFeB magnet to realize a wearable and self&#8208;powered sensor is reported, which provides open prospects for real&#8208;time gesture interaction based on an electromagnetic generator and is expected to achieve a wide range of future applications for intuitive and natural human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are highly desirable for human motion monitoring, and can be used to build new forms of bionic robots. However, the current use of flexible strain gauges is hindered by the need for an external power supply, and the demand for long&#8208;term operation. Here, a new flexible self&#8208;powered strain sensor system based on an electromagnetic generator that possesses a high stretchability in excess of 150%, a short response time of 30&#160;ms, and an excellent linearity (R2&#160;&gt; 0.98), is presented. Based on this new form of sensor, a human&#8211;machine interaction system is designed to achieve remote control of a robot hand and vehicle using a human hand, which provides a new scheme for real&#8208;time gesture interaction.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of B4C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B4C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B4C.








Abstract
The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B4C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

         <title>The Negative&#8208;Charge&#8208;Triggered &#8220;Dead Zone&#8221; between Electrode and Current Collector Realizes Ultralong Cycle Life of Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, lightweight, durable, and low&#8208;cost current collector, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) film, is achieved for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. A large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups are incorporated onto the surface of the MXene film to form rich negative charges region on its surface, which shields the positive electrode material from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation in its &#8220;dead zone.&#8221;








Abstract
Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large&#8208;sized AlCl4&#8722; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&#8722; and COOH&#8722; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative&#8208;charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl4&#8722; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times. It is believed that the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, volume expansion of the electrodes after intercalation of active ions is highly undesirable yet inetvitable, and it can significantly reduce the adhesion force between the electrodes and current collectors. Especially in aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), the intercalation of large-sized AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can greatly weaken this adhesion force and result in the detachment of the electrodes from the current collectors, which seems an inherent and irreconcilable problem. Here, an interesting concept, the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;, is presented to overcome the above challenge. By incorporating a large number of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and COOH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups onto the surface of MXene film, a rich negative-charge region is formed on its surface. When used as the current collector for AIBs, it shields a tiny area of the positive electrode (adjacent to the current collector side) from AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation due to the repulsion force, and a tiny inert layer (dead zone) at the interface of the positive electrode is formed, preventing the electrode from falling off the current collector. This helps to effectively increase the battery's cycle life to as high as 50&#160;000 times. It is believed that the proposed concept can be an important reference for future development of current collectors in rocking chair batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultralow Coercivity via an Amorphous&#8211;Nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in an FeCo&#8208;Based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative compositional design concept enables the construction of a unique transitional microstructure between traditional amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, which results in an alloy with an unprecedented combination of exceptionally high saturation magnetic flux density (Bs&#160;= 1.94 T) and ultralow coercivity (Hc&#160;= 4.3 A m&#8722;1), breaking the general trade&#8208;off between Bs and Hc in the soft&#8208;magnetic&#8208;material family.








Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in the soft magnetic material family. Here, superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8722;1 are unprecedentedly combined in an FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5 nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipoles, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of the next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;efficiency, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides opening the black box of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N) doping in graphdiyne, the relationship between N configurations and reaction routes in CO2 reduction is clarified. The sp&#8208;N atoms would induce high selectivity toward CH4 generation, owing to the optimized adsorption of precursor and intermediate. This work would guide the site&#8208;defined doping in carbon materials for advanced catalysts.








Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction is site&#8208;defined introduced. However, the reaction intermediate of this process is never captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule is realized, and finally sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction is obtained. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 toward CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.








Abstract
The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn&#8208;rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni3Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free-standing FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen-evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state-of-the-art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid-solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in glass-forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic-level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost-effective electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) material is reported, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated. The enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability and long cycling life.








Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) is designed and synthesized, by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated. Compared with phenazine monomer, it is revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and an extremely long cycle life of 45&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Investigation of the charge&#8208;storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge&#8208;storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Controllable Gold Nanocluster&#8211;Emulsion Interface for Direct Cell Penetration and Photothermal Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed tailorable amphiphilic gold nanoclusters facilitate the dynamic formation of emulsions by engaging in interfacial coupling, which enhances emulsion stability and nanocluster photophysical performance. The segregated interfacial microdomains of nanoclusters on the emulsion surface determine their biointerfacial interactions and allow them to directly penetrate cell membranes. The developed functional emulsions are well suited for multifluorescence tracing and photothermal killing.








Abstract
In the view of their ability to be uptaken by cells, colloidal particles can exert diverse physiological effects and are promising vehicles for the intracellular delivery of biologically active substances. Given that the modulation of biomaterial interfaces greatly facilitates the prediction and control of the corresponding cellular responses, the interfacial behavior of hydrophobic dye&#8208;modified gold (Au) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is rationally designed to develop Au NC&#8208;containing emulsions and control their biointerfacial interactions with cell membranes. The observed biological performance is indicative of a physical penetration mechanism. The amphiphilic Au NCs decrease the interfacial energy of two immiscible liquids and hinder droplet coalescence to facilitate the formation of emulsions thermodynamically stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the amphiphilic Au NCs are localized on the emulsion droplet surface and form segregated interfacial microdomains that adapt to the membrane structure and facilitate the traverse of the emulsions across the cell membrane via direct penetration. Fast penetration coupled with excellent photophysical performance endows the emulsions with multifluorescence tracing and efficient photothermal killing capabilities. The successful change of the interaction mode between NCs and biological objects and the provision of a universal formulation to modulate biointerfacial interactions are expected to inspire new bioapplications.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals, progress, and prospects of vacancy engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward electrocatalytic applications are reviewed. Vacancy manufacturing strategies, characterization techniques, and unique roles in electrocatalysis are considered, and the evolution of vacancy configuration from aggregated to atomic distribution is comprehensively discussed. The lifetime dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations of vacancy&#8208;mediated electrocatalysts are also highlighted.








Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) toward the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D&#8208;TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization, and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulting catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy&#8208;engineering&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigates their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>Powder Metallurgy Route to Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Refractory Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sintering refractory metals/alloys to high density while maintaining fine microstructure is of paramount importance to ensure their applications. A comprehensive understanding of the sintering issues and microstructural design rules is discussed. Powder metallurgy advances in specific materials systems, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), and refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites are reviewed.








Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear energy, and many others under extreme environments. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well&#8208;controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules, and PM practices towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals are sought to be provided. The previous efforts shall be reviewed to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nanopowders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense UFG refractory metals down to &#8776;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys, and their composites. Last, future developments and the endeavor towards UFG and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptionally uniform microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid interfaces play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of solid&#8208;state batteries. This review provides an overview on the solid&#8211;solid interfaces from aspects of structural features, Li&#8208;ion transport, interfacial contact, and electro&#8208;chemical reactions. The existing interface issues and improvement strategies are discussed. Opportunities and future trends on the investigation and optimization of these interfaces are highlighted.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8211;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this review, the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors are discussed. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8211;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed By In Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of in situ and environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and recent advances in structure dynamics of nanocrystals are reviewed. The nucleation and growth of nanocrystals, structure dynamics, and structure evolution under reaction conditions are discussed in detail. The methodologies and challenges of in situ TEM are also proposed.








Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM, reveal insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in situ electron microscopy, a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions are given. In the nucleation and growth part, existing nucleation theories and growth pathways are organized based on liquid and gas&#8211;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, the focus is on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, solid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere are discussed and the structure&#8211;property relationship is correlated. Even though impressive progress is made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>P&#8208;Type 2D Semiconductors for Future Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D semiconductors represent one of the most promising candidates to extend Moore's law. However, their full potential has been greatly hindered by the limited p&#8208;type ones with high performance and stability. This review offers a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals, current status, and outlook of p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors, aiming to inspire relevant research for advanced future electronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors represent one of the best candidates to extend Moore's law for their superiorities, such as keeping high carrier mobility and remarkable gate&#8208;control capability at atomic thickness. Complementary transistors and van der Waals junctions are critical in realizing 2D semiconductors&#8208;based integrated circuits suitable for future electronics. N&#8208;type 2D semiconductors have been reported predominantly for the strong electron doping caused by interfacial charge impurities and internal structural defects. By contrast, superior and reliable p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors with holes as majority carriers are still scarce. Not only that, but some critical issues have not been adequately addressed, including their controlled synthesis in wafer size and high quality, defect and carrier modulation, optimization of interface and contact, and application in high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power integrated devices. Here the material toolkit, synthesis strategies, device basics, and digital electronics closely related to p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors are reviewed. Their opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future electronic applications are also discussed, which would be promising or even shining in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <dc:description>
Although research on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials has been booming for decades, more research is needed on how to utilize them to construct efficient information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. A review of recent representative studies on information sensing, processing, and feedback devices based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials to provide a perspective on developing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technologies is presented.








Abstract
A wide variety of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with excellent properties can meet almost all the requirements of functional materials for information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. Low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are becoming the star of hope on the road to pursuing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions, benefiting from the breakthroughs in precise preparation, performance regulation, structural design, and device construction in recent years. This review summarizes several types of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials commonly used in human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions and outlines the differences in properties and application areas of different materials. According to the sequence of information flow in the human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing interaction process, the representative research progress of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials&#8208;based information sensing, processing, and feedback devices is reviewed and the key roles played by low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are discussed. Finally, the development trends and existing challenges of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials in the field of human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technology are discussed.

         <title>Van der Waals&#8208;Interface&#8208;Dominated All&#8208;2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional silicon&#8208;based devices, the unique features of all&#8208;2D electronics are atomic flatness and dangling&#8208;bond van der Waals interfaces, including all&#8208;2D metal/semiconductor, all&#8208;2D semiconductor/semiconductor, and all&#8208;2D dielectric/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces provide an excellent device platform for removing lattice matching constraints, suppressing carrier scattering, and exploiting new physical effects.








Abstract
The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon&#8208;based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin 2D materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short&#8208;channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high&#8208;quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all&#8208;2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all&#8208;2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, the unique properties of all&#8208;2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods are systematically reviewed and the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics are summarized, respectively. Finally, the recent progress and challenges for all&#8208;2D vdW electronics are discussed, and how to improve the compatibility of 2D material devices with silicon&#8208;based industrial technology is pointed out as a critical challenge.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 50, December 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on why implementing a membrane&#8208;based electrolyte is the priority for mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries and identifies critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide electrolyte membrane. The challenges and associated strategies for achieving these criteria in terms of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration are systematically analyzed and summarized.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>Mechanical Properties of Conducting Printed Nanosheet Network Thin Films Under Uniaxial Compression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed thin film nanosheet networks show remarkable promise for a range of electrical applications. Their conductivity relies heavily on their morphology, which may be altered via compression. This work provides the first exploration of the compressive properties of printed networks of graphene and MoS2 to explore properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure, and sheet bending versus slippage.








Abstract
Thin film networks of solution processed nanosheets show remarkable promise for use in a broad range of applications including strain sensors, energy storage, printed devices, textile electronics, and more. While it is known that their electronic properties rely heavily on their morphology, little is known of their mechanical nature, a glaring omission given the effect mechanical deformation has on the morphology of porous systems and the promise of mechanical post processing for tailored properties. Here, this work employs a recent advance in thin film mechanical testing called the Layer Compression Test to perform the first in situ analysis of printed nanosheet network compression. Due to the well&#8208;defined deformation geometry of this unique test, this work is able to explore the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic, plastic, and creep deformation in these systems, extracting properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure and sheet bending vs. slippage under both out of plane uniaxial compression and tension. This work characterizes these for a range of networks of differing porosities and sheet sizes, for low and high compression, as well as the effect of chemical cross linking. This work explores graphene and MoS2 networks, from which the results can be extended to printed nanosheet networks as a whole.

         <title>Deformation&#8208;Induced Photoprogrammable Pattern of Polyurethane Elastomers Based on Poisson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns with high aspect ratio on polyurethane elastomers is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and the distribution of internal stress. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in stretchable strain sensors, anticounterfeiting devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Elastomers with high aspect ratio surface patterns are a promising class of materials for designing soft machines in the future. Here, a facile method for fabricating surface patterns on polyurethane elastomer by subtly utilizing the Poisson effect and gradient photocrosslinking is demonstrated. By applying uniaxial tensile strains, the aspect ratio of the surface patterns can be optionally manipulated. At prestretched state, the pattern on the polyurethane elastomer can be readily constructed through compressive stress, resulting from the gradient photocrosslinking via selective photodimerization of an anthracene&#8208;functionalized polyurethane elastomer (referred to as ANPU). The macromolecular aggregation structures during stretching deformation significantly contribute to the fabrication of high aspect ratio surface patterns. The insightful finite element analysis well demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of internal stress in the ANPU elastomer can be regulated by selectively gradient crosslinking, leading to polymer chains migrate from the exposed region to the unexposed region, thereby generating a diverse array of surface patterns. Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanorobot&#8208;Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. The robotic system improves the targeting rate and therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor treatment with the hierarchical targeting strategy spanning targeting scale from centimeters to nanometers.








Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8211;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery is reported. For primary targeting on macroscale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on microscale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients are conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to the hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polypeptides containing semicarbazide moieties via direct polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) based monomers. These polypeptides can be further decorated with ketone/aldehyde&#8208;containing agents with the formation of pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages. The intracellular acidic pH&#8208;triggered release promotes drug escape from endolysosomes and enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, which can be also employed for highly sensitive detection of tumor lesions.








Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of watermelon&#8208;like ZnSnO3@UCNPs (upconversion nanoparticles) heterostructure can effectively prevent the degradation of piezoelectric ZnSnO3 quantum dots in tumor environment, fully utilizing its piezoelectric catalytic effect as an antitumor carrier. Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sono-photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QDs) with piezo-photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one-pot thermal decomposition method to form an all-in-one watermelon-like structured sono-photosensitizer (ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@UCNPs). The excited near-infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon-like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near-infrared laser co-activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono-photosensitizers through structural design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Three&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Nanozyme Composite for Augmented Cascade Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;nanozyme, bimetallic Au&#8211;Pt NPs with triple&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, is reported with the self&#8208;supply of O2 with CAT&#8208;mimicking activity, H2O2 production with GOx&#8208;mimicking activity, and &#8226;OH formation with POD&#8208;mimicking activity for chemodynamic therapy. Together with photothermal accelerated catalytic conversion and GSH consumption, augmented cascade catalytic tumor therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Cascade catalytic reaction exhibits simple procedure and high efficiency, such as that from the orderly assembly of different enzymes in biological systems. Mimicking of the natural cascade procedure becomes critical, but the orderly assembly of different enzymes is still challenging. Herein, single Au&#8211;Pt nanozyme is reported with &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; functions to initiate cascade conversions for O2 supply as mimic catalase, H2O2 production with its glucose oxidase&#8208;like property, and &#8226;OH generation as mimic peroxidase for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Thus, the complex assembly and cross&#8208;talk among the different enzymes are avoided. To this end, metastable Cu2O NPs, as scaffolds, are used to anchor ultrasmall Au&#8211;Pt nanozyme, while metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used to encapsulate the nanozyme for tumor microenvironment response and shielding protein adsorption. Pluronic F127 is then modified on the surface to improve hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of the composite. The endogenous acidity and glutathione in tumor degrade MOF to expose nanozyme for cascade catalytic CDT. The high photothermal conversion ability also enhances the CDT, while Cu2+ ions consume GSH to further improve CDT efficiency as augmented cascade catalytic tumor therapy. Thus, a new paradigm is provided with drug&#8208;free single nanozyme for improving tumor therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.

         <title>A Perspective on Uniform Plating Behavior of Mg Metal Anode: Diffusion Limited Theory versus Nucleation Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective points out the &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; between &#8220;Kinetic&#8208;Control Region&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;, where the current density exceeds limited value, but time has not yet reached the Sand's time. In this buffer zone, dense and uniform Mg deposit layer is available, even the optimal deposit occurs in the vicinity of the boundary between &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;.








Abstract
Utilizing metal anode is the most attractive way to meet the urgent demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Unfortunately, the formation of dendrites, which is caused by uneven plating behavior, always threaten the safety of the batteries. To explore the origin of different plating behavior and predict the plating morphology of anode under a variety of operating conditions, multifarious models have been developed. However, abuse of models has led to conflictive views. In this perspective, to clarify the controversial reports on magnesium (Mg) metal plating behavior, the previously proposed models are elaborated that govern the plating process. Through linking various models and clarifying their boundary conditions, a scheme is drawn to illustrate the strategy for achieving the most dense and uniform plating morphology, which also explains the seemingly contradictory of diffusion limited theory and nucleation theory on uniform plating. This perspective will undoubtedly enhance the understanding on the metal anode plating process and provide meaningful guidance for the development of metal anode batteries.

         <title>Platinum Prodrug Nanoparticles with COX&#8208;2 Inhibition Amplifies Pyroptosis for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immune Activation of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Pyroptosis, an emerging mechanism of programmed cell death, holds great potential to trigger a robust antitumor immune response. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents can induce pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 activation. However, these agents also enhance cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression, leading to drug resistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and significantly limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Herein, we developed an amphiphilic polymer (denoted as PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) containing both indomethacin (In, a COX&#8208;2 inhibitor) and platinum prodrug (Pt(IV)), which is responsive to glutathione (GSH). This polymer self&#8208;assembled into form nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&#8208;In NP) that can disintegrate in cancer cells due to the GSH responsiveness, releasing In to inhibit the COX&#8208;2 expression, hence overcoming the chemoresistance and amplifying cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, Pt&#8208;In NP significantly inhibit tumor growth and elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, when combined with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) treatment, Pt&#8208;In NP demonstrate the ability to completely suppress metastatic tumors, transforming &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;. Overall, the sustained release of Pt(IV) and In from Pt&#8208;In NP amplifies platnium&#8208;drug&#8208;induced pyroptosis to elicit long&#8208;term immune responses, hence presenting a generalizable strategy for pancreatic cancer.

Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites hinders the future development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Despite that (100) plane possesses better zincophilic ability and fast kinetics, dendrites were generally suppressed via (002) plane&#8208;oriented Zn deposition in previous reports; the ordered (100) plane&#8208;dominant Zn deposition especially under high current density have not yet been realized. Herein, we report vertically&#8208;oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of (100) plane using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. DLP is preferentially anchored on the Zn (002) crystal plane via polar phosphate group, then the deposition of Zn atoms on the (002) plane is retarded by the long alkyl chain, finally promoting the preferred growth of the (100) plane. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell also cycles steadily for 700&#160;h with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides new insights into the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by crystal plane modulation.

         <title>Novel Ultra&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional SbBi Alloy Structure with Precise Regulation Ratio Enables Long&#8208;Stable Potassium/Lithium ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Sb or Bi limit their practical applications in high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;stability potassium/lithium ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high&#8208;capacity Sb and high&#8208;stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one&#8208;step co&#8208;replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode exhibits high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode remains a high&#8208;stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;87.8% retention) and an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling stability of 1000 cycles (only 0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism was revealed by kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques, and DFT theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra&#8208;stable structure and synergistic interaction within 2D&#8208;binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K+ adsorption energy and decreases K+ diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D&#8208;Bi or 2D&#8208;Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of two-dimensional (2D) Sb or Bi limit their practical applications in high-capacity and long-stability potassium/lithium ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high-capacity Sb and high-stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one-step co-replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, 2D-Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt; anode exhibits high-capacity and ultra-stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, 2D-Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt; anode remains a high-stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8764;87.8% retention) and an ultra-long-cycling stability of 1000 cycles (only 0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism was revealed by kinetic analysis, in-situ/ex-situ characterization techniques, and DFT theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra-stable structure and synergistic interaction within 2D-binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption energy and decreases K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D-Bi or 2D-Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multiple H&#8208;bonding Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Storage And Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) are considered among the most promising candidates for thermal energy storage and management. However, the application of SSPCMs is consistently hindered by the canonical trade&#8208;off between high thermal energy storage capacity and mechanical robustness. In addition, they suffer from poor recyclability due to chemical cross&#8208;linking. Herein, a straightforward but effective strategy for fabricating supramolecular SSPCMs with high latent heat and mechanical strength is proposed. The supramolecular polymer employs multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions as robust physical cross&#8208;links. This enables SSPCM with a high enthalpy of phase transition (142.5 J g&#8722;1), strong mechanical strength (36.9&#160;MPa), and sound shape stability (maintaining shape integrity at 120&#176;C) even with a high content of phase change component (97 wt%). When SSPCM is utilized to regulate the operating temperature of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), it significantly diminishes the battery working temperature by 23&#176;C at a discharge rate of 3C. The robust thermal management capability enabled through solid&#8208;solid phase change provides practical opportunities for applications in fast discharging and high&#8208;power batteries. Overall, this study presents a feasible strategy for designing linear SSPCMs with high latent heat and exceptional mechanical strength for thermal management.

         <title>Time&#8208;sequential and Multi&#8208;functional 3d Printed Mgo2/PLGA Scaffold Developed as A Novel Biodegradable and Bioactive Bone Substitute for Challenging Postsurgical Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most commonly occurring primary bone malignant tumor. The clinical postsurgical OS treatment faces big challenges for the staged therapeutic requirements of early anti&#8208;tumor, anti&#8208;bacterial, and long&#8208;lasting osteogenesis. Herein, multi&#8208;functional bioactive scaffolds with time&#8208;sequential functions of prevent tumor recurrence, inhibit bacterial infection and promote bone defect repair have been rationally designed as a novel strategy. Nanocomposite scaffold magnesium peroxide (MgO2)/poly (lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) is prepared by low&#8208;temperature 3D printing for controllable releasing magnesium ions (Mg2+) and ROS in a time&#8208;sequential manner. The scaffold with 20 wt% MgO2 (20MP) is verified with desired mechanical properties, as well as exhibits staged release behavior of bioactive elements with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release for the first 3 weeks, and long&#8208;lasting Mg2+ release for 12 weeks. The released H2O2 initiates chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis in tumor cells, along with activating the anticancer immune microenvironment by M1 polarization of macrophages. The released Mg2+ subsequently enhances bone repair by activating the Wnt3a/GSK&#8208;3&#946;/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and creating osteopromotive immune microenvironment by M2 polarization of macrophages. In conclusion, the multi&#8208;functional 20MP scaffold demonstrates time&#8208;sequential therapeutic properties as an innovative strategy for OS&#8208;associated challenging bone defect treatment.

         <title>Observation of Ferroelectric Lithography on Biodegradable PLA Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric lithography&#8212;a technique that can precisely pattern the ferroelectric domain in the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale in accordance with the predefined pattern&#8212;is observed on the semicrystalline biomaterial poly(lactic acid) thin films fabricated with a simple melt&#8208;casting method, providing new possibility for their applications as high&#8208;precision ferroelectric memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric lithography, which can purposefully control and pattern ferroelectric domains in the micro&#8208;/nanometer scale, has extensive applications in data memories, field&#8208;effect transistors, race&#8208;track memory, tunneling barriers, and integrated biochemical sensors. In pursuit of mechanical flexibility and light weight, organic ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) are developed; however, they still suffer from complicated stretching processes of film fabrication and poor degradability. These poor features severely hinder their applications. Here, the ferroelectric lithography on the biocompatible and biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) thin films at room temperature is demonstrated. The semicrystalline PLA thin film can be easily fabricated through the melt&#8208;casting method, and the desired domain structures can be precisely written according to the predefined patterns. Most importantly, the coercive voltage (Vc) of PLA thin film is relatively low (lower than 30 V) and can be further reduced with the decrease of the film thickness. These intriguing behaviors combined with satisfying biodegradability make PLA thin film a desirable candidate for ferroelectric lithography and enable its future application in the field of bioelectronics and biomedicine. This work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric lithography on other polymer ferroelectrics as well as their application as nanostructured devices.

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual reinforcement of ferroptosis and antitumor immunity is a promising strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy. Effective interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;)&#160;delivery sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis induced by an ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanocarrier. Immunogenic cancer cell death and tumor microenvironment modulation evoke strong immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T cells released IFN&#947; in turn promotes ferroptosis occurrence.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN&#947;) (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery&#8208;induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on CrN Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atomic layers catalysts with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites and epitaxial strain are successfully grown on low&#8208;cost CrN nanoparticles via a facile thermal ammonlysis method. The Pt atomic layers on CrN electrocatalyst deliver outstanding activity and durability for the formic acid oxidation reaction, guiding the development of low&#8208;cost Pt&#8208;based catalysts for various applications.








Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) is utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt atomic layers&#160;catalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibits excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 that is 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Reconstruction of Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers for Resolving Heterogeneity of Vesicles in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a vitro system composed of synaptic vesicle&#8208;sized vesicles coupled to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) nanorulers, which enables to selectively connect isolated vesicles to generate vesicle assemblies with controlled lateral distance (from 3 to 10 nm). Moreover, this work analyzes the state heterogeneity of vesicles (individual vesicle or vesicle clusters) in cells and vesicle release heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.








Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play a pivotal role in efficient interneuronal communications in vivo. However, the coexistence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. The high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, this work uses synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers program the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 to 10 nm. This work uses the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicle assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtain a larger proportion of complex events. This work resolves the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8776;0.1 ms. This work further analyzes the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. The results indicate that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters is critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has the potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyester nanofiltration membrane for cation separation is prepared by interfacial polymerization of TET with TMC. The &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities in the TET confer the TET&#8208;TMC membrane with dense structures and positive surface charge, leading to MgCl2 retention (95.5%) significantly higher than other polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%).








Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designs a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer undergoes efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;offs (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4&#160;mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>Bridging The Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First And Second Shell Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzyme) constitute a promising category of enzyme&#8208;mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes has been improved through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase&#8208;reactions. Here, we report on the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes. The optimized SAzyme exhibited a turnover rate of 52.7 s&#8722;1 and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. A computational study revealed that axial S&#8208;ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism and SO2&#8208;functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. Additionally, SAzyme showed superior anti&#8208;tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with a Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O2 concentration in triphase interface.








Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN&#8208;based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface can promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), increases ion migration barrier, induces (100) facet perovskite grain growth, and yields defect&#8208;reduced, homogeneous films. The blade&#8208;coated PABA&#8208;based inverted PSC achieves an impressive PCE of 23.32% and maintains 93.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 75 &#176;C and 10% relative humidity.








Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects, is reported. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintain 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1&#160;000 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible paper&#8208;based scaffold exhibiting gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size is fabricated using an industrially compatible papermaking process. This triple&#8208;gradient design controls the Mg ion flux for bottom&#8208;up deposition, facilitating superior cyclability. The high flexibility and minimal thickness of the scaffold align well with the emerging demand for flexible and wearable electronics, signaling a robust pathway for their advancement.








Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform magnesium (Mg) nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design is achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers is meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enables the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Synaptic Memory in Supramolecularly Engineered Janus 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial synapse combining short&#8208;term potentiation (STP) and long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) in a single device is realized through the supramolecular engineering of 2D MoS2. The Janus 2D material asymmetrically functionalized with a ferrocene (Fc)/ferrocenium (Fc+) redox couple and a photochromic azobenzene (Azo) responds to electrochemical and optical stimulus enabling fast&#8208;response STP as well as 4&#8208;bit (16 memory states) LTP.








Abstract
Artificial synapses combining multiple yet independent signal processing strategies in a single device are key enabler to achieve high&#8208;density of integration, energy efficiency, and fast data manipulation in brain&#8208;like computing. By taming functional complexity, the use of hybrids comprising multiple materials as active components in synaptic devices represents a powerful route to encode both short&#8208;term potentiation (STP) and long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) in synaptic circuitries. To meet such a grand challenge, herein a novel Janus 2D material is developed by dressing asymmetrically the two surfaces of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with an electrochemically&#8208;switchable ferrocene (Fc)/ ferrocenium (Fc+) redox couple and an optically&#8208;responsive photochromic azobenzene (Azo). Upon varying the magnitude of the electrochemical stimulus, it is possible to steer the transition between STP and LTP, thereby either triggering electrochemical doping of Fc/Fc+&#160;pair on MoS2&#160;or controlling an adsorption/desorption process of such redox species on MoS2.&#160;In addition, a lower magnitude LTP is recorded by activating the photoisomerization of azobenzene chemisorbed molecules and therefore modulating the dipole&#8208;induced doping of the 2D semiconductor. Significantly, the interplay of electrochemical and optical stimuli makes it possible to construct artificial synapses where LTP can be boosted to 4&#8208;bit (16 memory states) while simultaneously functioning as STP.

         <title>A Generic Strategy to Stabilize Wide Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key cause of phase segregation in WBG perovskites is identified as residual PbI2 at the interface, creating electrical potential variations between domain surfaces and boundaries, inducing ion migration and subsequent phase segregation. Applying a surface reaction strategy to eliminate surface PbI2 residue enhances bandgap stability and mitigates photovoltage deficits in complete devices.








Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, the root cause of halide segregation is investigated, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to potential electrical differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide (EDAI2) at proper temperature, it is possible to effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, a notable improvement of &#8776;100&#160;mV is achieved in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8211;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, efficiency of 26.1% is demonstrated in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Controlled Growth of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Nanoribbons on 1H&#8208;MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structure is synthesized via a facile chemical vapor deposition method. By precisely controlling the growth atmosphere, the semimetallic 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 nanoribbon can be grown on the top of the semiconducting 1H&#8208;MoS2 nanosheet, forming a semiconductor/semimetal heterophase structure. The device fabricated with the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structure displays a rectifying behavior, leading to enhanced performance for photodetection.








Abstract
2D heterostructures are emerging as alternatives to conventional semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium, and gallium nitride, for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics. However, the direct growth of 2D heterostructures, especially for those with metastable phases still remains challenging. To obtain 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with designed phases, it is highly desired to develop phase&#8208;controlled synthetic strategies. Here, a facile chemical vapor deposition method is reported to prepare vertical 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structures. By simply changing the growth atmosphere, semimetallic 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 can be in situ grown on the top of semiconducting 1H&#8208;MoS2, forming vertical semiconductor/semimetal 1H/1T&#8242; heterophase structures with a sharp interface. The integrated device based on the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structure displays a typical rectifying behavior with a current rectifying ratio of &#8776;103. Moreover, the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2&#8208;based photodetector achieves a responsivity of 1.07 A W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm with an ultralow dark current of less than 10&#8722;11 A. The aforementioned results indicate that 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structures can be a promising candidate for future rectifiers and photodetectors. Importantly, the approach may pave the way toward tailoring the phases of TMDs, which can help us utilize phase engineering strategies to promote the performance of electronic devices.

By precisely controlling the growth atmosphere, the semimetallic 1T&#8242;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbon can be grown on the top of the semiconducting 1H-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet, forming a semiconductor/semimetal heterophase structure. The device fabricated with the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterophase structure displays a rectifying behavior, leading to enhanced performance for photodetection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D heterostructures are emerging as alternatives to conventional semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium, and gallium nitride, for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. However, the direct growth of 2D heterostructures, especially for those with metastable phases still remains challenging. To obtain 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with designed phases, it is highly desired to develop phase-controlled synthetic strategies. Here, a facile chemical vapor deposition method is reported to prepare vertical 1H/1T&#8242; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterophase structures. By simply changing the growth atmosphere, semimetallic 1T&#8242;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be in situ grown on the top of semiconducting 1H-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forming vertical semiconductor/semimetal 1H/1T&#8242; heterophase structures with a sharp interface. The integrated device based on the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterophase structure displays a typical rectifying behavior with a current rectifying ratio of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based photodetector achieves a responsivity of 1.07 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 532&#160;nm with an ultralow dark current of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;11&lt;/sup&gt; A. The aforementioned results indicate that 1H/1T&#8242; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterophase structures can be a promising candidate for future rectifiers and photodetectors. Importantly, the approach may pave the way toward tailoring the phases of TMDs, which can help us utilize phase engineering strategies to promote the performance of electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mid&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Activatable Full Spectrum LaB6 Plasmonic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic LaB6 photocatalyst can be excited by mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light and thermal radiation from hot/warm objects to generate reactive oxygen species and exert photodegradation of organic pollutants, as well as disinfection of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public areas/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8211;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8776;1265 nm. None of the existing photocatalysts can function during nighttime in the absence of external light. Herein, an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst is reported, which can absorb UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for the decomposition of organic pollutants, as well as kill multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (&#8776;2&#8211;50 &#181;m) is readily available from the natural environments via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth including human bodies, animals, furnances,&#160;hot/warm electrical devices, and buildings.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tactile sensor, which integrates biomimetic slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors in a soft medium, enables self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at the contact surface. In robotic manipulation, the sensor can achieve the self&#8208;adaptive perception of material softness and enhance tactile perception by establishing two relevant deformation attributes (material softness and compliance) for an object.








Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel NIR Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound FWHM Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:0.05Cr3+ exhibits impressive external quantum efficiency and output power. MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ undergoes a transition from ultra&#8208;narrowband to ultra&#8208;broadband emission as the Cr3+ concentration increased, driven by energy transfer between the three emitting centers.








Abstract
There is strong demand for ultraefficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;(LED)&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED (pc&#8208;LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) encounters challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in battery performance under harsh environments. Here, we introduce a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O, ethylene glycol, and InCl3 solution to effectively extend the lifespan of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#176;C. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the H2O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual&#8208;interaction, involving coordination with Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques revealed that HEE in&#8208;situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation&#8208;reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase were further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials have attracted increasing interest. However, the effective and controllable production of extremely downsized materials through physical strategies remains a great challenge. Herein, we report an all&#8208;physical top&#8208;down method for the production of sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene with completely broken lattice. The graphene subnanometer materials (GSNs) with monolayer structures and lateral sizes of approximately 0.5&#160;nm are obtained. Compared with their bulk, nanosheets, and quantum sheets, the intrinsic GSNs present extremely enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption performances, as well as unique carrier behavior. The non&#8208;equilibrium states induced by the entirely exposed and broken, intrinsic lattices in sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene could be determinative to their extreme performances. Our work shows the great potential of broken lattice and provides new insights towards subnanometer materials.

         <title>Transport&#8208;limited Growth of Coccolith Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biogenic crystals present a variety of complex morphologies that form with exquisite fidelity. In the case of the intricate morphologies of coccoliths, calcite crystals produced by marine algae, only a single set of crystallographic facets is utilized. It is unclear which growth process can merge this simple crystallographic habit with the species&#8208;specific architectures. Here, we use a suite of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electron microscopies to follow both the growth trajectories of the crystals ex situ, and the cellular environment in situ, in the species Emiliania huxleyi. We show that crystal growth alternates between a space filling and a skeletonized growth mode, where the crystals elongate via their stable crystallographic facets, but the final morphology is a manifestation of growth arrest. This process is reminiscent of the balance between reaction&#8208;limited and transport&#8208;limited growth regimes underlying snowflake formation. We suggest that localized ion transport regulates the kinetic instabilities that are required for transport&#8208;limited growth, leading to reproducible morphologies.

         <title>Eco&#8208;friendly Solvent Engineered CsPbI2.77Br0.23 Ink for Large&#8208;Area And Scalable High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The performance of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells has been assessed for typical compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), using a blade coater, slot&#8208;die coater, solution shearing, ink&#8208;jet printing, and thermal evaporation. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films is not well developed. This study developed, for the first time, an eco&#8208;friendly solvent engineered all&#8208;inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile, 2&#8208;methoxyethanol, or a mixture of acetonitrile and 2&#8208;methoxyethanol to fabricate large&#8208;area CsPbI2.77Br0.23 films with slot&#8208;die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50&#176;C). We thoroughly examined the perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of new inks prepared with different solvent ratios and correlated them with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated CsPbI2.77Br0.23 perovskite film, which was prepared from the eco&#8208;friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile (0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrated an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintained ca. 91% of its original power conversion efficiency after one month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. We believe that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.

         <title>Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II Ratiometric Nanothermometers for 3D In Vivo Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Luminescent nanothermometry, particularly the one based ratiometric, has sparked intense research for non&#8208;invasive in vivo or intracellular temperature mapping, empowering their uses as diagnosis tools in biomedicine. However, ratiometric detection still suffers from biased sensing induced by wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering, low thermal sensitivity (Sr), and lack of imaging depth information. Herein, we construct an ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometer with self&#8208;calibrating ability for 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, in which temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and strongly temperature&#8208;quenched Ag2S quantum dots are co&#8208;assembled to form a hybrid nanocomposite material. Precise control over the amount ratio between two sub&#8208;materials enables the manipulation of heat&#8208;activated back energy transfer from Ag2S to Yb3+ in lanthanide nanoparticles, thereby rendering Sr up to 7.8% &#176;C&#8722;1 at 43.5 &#176;C, and higher than 6.5% &#176;C&#8722;1 over the entire physiological temperature range. Moreover, the luminescence intensity ratio between two separated spectral regions within the narrow Yb3+ emission peak is used to determine the depth information of nanothermometers in living mice and correct the effect of tissue depth on 2D thermographic imaging, and therefore allows a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of accurate 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, constituting a solid step towards the development of advanced ratiometric nanothermometry for biological applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Meta&#8208;Display: Photoluminescence and Pumping Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advent of intelligent display devices has given rise to diverse and complex demands for miniature light&#8208;emitting devices. Light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces have emerged as a practical and efficient means of achieving precise light modulation. However, their practicality is limited by certain constraints. Firstly, there is a need for further exploration of the ability to manipulate both pumping and emitting light simultaneously. Secondly, there is currently no encoding freedom in multi&#8208;dimensional emitting light. To address these concerns, we propose using meta&#8208;atoms to encode both fluorescence and pumping light independently, and expand the encoding freedom with different incident wavevector directions. We further demonstrate a light&#8208;emitting metasurface with quad&#8208;fold multiplex encoding meta&#8208;displays, including dual scattering images and dual fluorescence images. Our design strategy not only manipulates both pumping and fluorescence light, but also broadens encoding freedom for comprehensive multi&#8208;functionality. This could pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.

         <title>Accelerated Confined Mass Transfer of MoS2 1d Nanotube in Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Applying the solar energy into energy storage battery systems is challenged in achieving green and sustainable development, however, the efficient progress of photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8722;air batteries is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes upon the photocathode. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional ordered MoS2 nanotube (MoS2&#8208;ONT) with confined mass transfer can be used to extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, which is capable of overcoming the challenge of rapid recombination of electron and holes. The tubular confined space can not only promote the orderly separation and migration of charge carriers, but also realize the accumulation of charge and the rapid activation of oxygen molecules. The concave surface of MoS2&#8208;ONT can improve the carrier separation ability and prolong the carrier lifetime. Meanwhile, the ordered tubular confined space can effectively realize the rapid transfer of charge, ion and oxygen. Under light irradiation, a fast ORR kinetic of 70&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8722;air battery is achieved, which is the highest value reported for photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8722;air batteries. Significantly, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 battery based on MoS2&#8208;ONT also shows superior rate capability and other exciting battery performance. This work shows the universality of the confined carrier separation strategy in photo&#8208;assisted metal&#8722;air batteries.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Layered Perovskite Coated with In&#8208;situ Exsolved Core&#8208;shell CuFe@FeOx Nanoparticles for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis</title>

Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO2 into CO, reducing CO2 emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here we report a new SOEC cathode for CO2 electrolysis consisting of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in&#8208;situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe alloy@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN&#8208;CFA@FeO cathode exhibits a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 for CO2 reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200&#160;h under 0.75 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO2. In&#8208;situ XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeOx shell, in contrast to conventional in&#8208;situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE&#8208;PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeOx shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

         <title>Biomimetic Targeting Nanoadjuvants for Sonodynamic And Chronological Multi&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Holistic Biofilm&#8208;Related Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) present significant challenges owing to drug resistance, adverse immune responses, and implant failure; however, current approaches inadequately cater to the diverse therapeutic requirements at different stages of infection. To address this issue, we proposed a multi&#8208;immunotherapy strategy in combination with sonodynamic therapy for the chronological treatment of BRIs. Macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated targeting sonosensitive nanoadjuvants were fabricated to load cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or microRNA (miR)&#8208;21&#8208;5p. In the early stages of BRI (Stage I), CPG&#8208;ODN&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (CPG@HMPN@M) promoted the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps to capture and neutralize detached microbes. During the late stage of infection (Stage II), CPG&#8208;ODNs redirected macrophage polarization into the M1 phase to combat infections via TLR9/Myd88/TRAF6 pathway. During these stages, CPG@HMPN@M generated singlet oxygen through sonodynamic processes, eradicating the biofilms under US irradiation. Once the BRIs were eliminated, miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (miR@HMPN@M) were delivered to the lesions to suppress excessive inflammation and promote tissue integration by evoking macrophage M2 polarization during the repair phase (Stage III) through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. This innovative approach aimed to provide comprehensive treatment strategies for the chronological treatment of BRI by effectively eliminating infections, promoting tissue restoration, and implementing different immune regulations at different stages, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing System for Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing offers promise for addressing structural failures, increasing lifespan, and improving durability in polymeric materials. Implementing self&#8208;healing in thermoset polymers faces significant manufacturing challenges, especially due to elevated temperature requirements of thermoset processing. To introduce self&#8208;healing into structural thermosets, the self&#8208;healing system must be thermally stable and compatible with the thermoset chemistry. Here we demonstrate a self&#8208;healing microcapsule&#8208;based system stable to frontal polymerization (FP), a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing process with a self&#8208;propagating exothermic reaction (&#8776; 200&#160;&#176;C). A thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type complex bearing two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands addresses limitations in conventional G2&#8208;based self&#8208;healing approaches. Under FP's elevated temperatures, the catalyst remained dormant until activated by the Cu(I) co&#8208;reagent, ensuring efficient polymerization of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) upon damage to the polyDCPD matrix. The two&#8208;part microcapsule system consisted of one capsule containing the thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type catalyst dissolved in the solvent, and another capsule containing a Cu(I) coagent blended with liquid DCPD monomer. Using same chemistry for both matrix fabrication and healing resulted in strong interfaces as demonstrated by lap&#8208;shear tests. In an optimized system, the self&#8208;healing system restored the mechanical properties of the tough polyDCPD thermoset. Self&#8208;healing efficiencies greater than 90% via tapered double cantilever beam tests were observed.

         <title>Age&#8208;associated Senescent &#8211; T Cell Signaling Promotes Type 3 Immunity that Inhibits the Biomaterial Regenerative Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and could potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age&#8208;related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, we characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)&#8208;17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age&#8208;associated senescent&#8208;T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improved healing and restored therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.

         <title>Longevous Cycling of Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Battery Enabled by &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; Cobalt Oxynitride/Porous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract
Developing commercially viable electrocatalyst lies at the research hotspot of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, but it is still challenging to meet the requirements of energy efficiency and durability in realistic applications. Strategic material design is critical to addressing its drawbacks in terms of sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions and limited battery lifespan. Herein, a &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture is designed for a hybrid catalyst constituting cobalt nitride as the core nanoparticle with thin oxidized coverings, which is further deposited within porous carbon aerogel. Based on synchrotron&#8208;based characterizations, this hybrid provides oxygen vacancies and Co&#8208;Nx&#8208;C sites as the active sites, resulting from a strong coupling between CoOxNy nanoparticles and 3D conductive carbon scaffolds. Compared to the oxide reference, it performs enhanced stability in harsh electrocatalytic environments, highlighting the benefits of the oxynitride. Furthermore, the 3D conductive scaffolds improve charge/mass transportation and boost durability of these active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduced N species into hybrid can synergistically tune the d&#8208;band center of cobalt and improve its bifunctional activity. As a result, the obtained air cathode exhibits bifunctional overpotential of 0.65&#160;V and a battery lifetime exceeding 1350 hours, which sets a new record for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery reported so far.

         <title>Unconventional Synthesis of Hierarchically Twinned Copper as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrate&#8211;Ammonia Conversion</title>

Abstract
Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, we propose a surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8208;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single&#8208;oriented TB and without TB. We discover that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO2*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and subsequent NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in The Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevated the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites could also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

&lt;p&gt;The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high-performance pluronic F127 (P127)-modified gold shell (AuS)-polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near-infrared irradiation, the resultant P127-AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2-type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel-encapsulating P127-AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra-lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone.

         <title>Confinement Engineering of Zinc Single&#8208;atom Triggered Charge Redistribution on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optimizing the interaction between metal and support in supported metal catalysts effectively refines the electronic structure and boosts the catalytic properties of loaded active components. We herein introduce a method to confine ultrafine ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles within atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped carbon network (Ru/Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) through the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, achieving superior catalytic activity and stability for alkaline hydrogen evolution. Spectroscopic data and theoretical modeling elucidate that the remarkable catalytic performance of Ru sites stems from their strong electronic coupling with neighboring isolated Zn&#8208;N4 moiety and pyridinic N/pyrrolic N. This interaction induces an electron&#8208;deficient state of Ru, thereby accelerating the dissociation of H2O and lowering the energy barriers for the desorption of OH* and H*. This insight provides a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at play. Furthermore, alkaline water electrolyzer using this catalyst as cathode delivers a mass activity of 3 A mgcat&#8211;1 at 2.0 volts, much surpassing Ru&#8208;C. This research opens a novel pathway for the development of advanced electrocatalysts, tailored for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage in Tungsten Bronze Dielectric Ceramics Through a Weakly Coupled Relaxor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, known for their ultra&#8208;fast discharge time and high&#8208;power density, find widespread applications in high&#8208;power pulse devices. However, ceramics featuring a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure (TTBs) have received limited attention due to their lower energy&#8208;storage capacity compared to perovskite counterparts. Herein, we report a TTBs relaxor ferroelectric ceramic based on the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8208;1.5xSmxNb2O6 composition, exhibiting an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 9 J/cm3 and an efficiency of 84% under an electric field of 660&#160;kV/cm. Notably, the energy storage performance of this ceramic shows remarkable stability against frequency, temperature, and cycling electric field. The introduction of Sm3+ doping was found to create weakly coupled polar nanoregions (PNRs) in the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485Nb2O6 ceramic. Structural characterizations reveal that the incommensurability parameter increases with higher Sm3+ content, indicative of a highly disordered A&#8208;site structure. Simultaneously, the breakdown strength is also enhanced by raising the conduction activation energy, widening the band gap, and reducing the electric field&#8208;induced strain. This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs&#8208;based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high&#8208;power pulse device applications.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, we comprehensively summarize multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, and provide insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, we discuss the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI and propose corresponding design principles, which is beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. Our review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;inspired Multisensory Neuromorphic Platform for Integration of Visual and Chemical Cues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Unisensory cues are often insufficient for animals to effectively engage in foraging, mating, and predatory activities. In contrast, the integration of cues collected from multiple sensory organs enhances the overall perceptual experience and thereby facilitates better decision&#8208;making. Despite the importance of multisensory integration in animals, the field of artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on processing unisensory information. This lack of emphasis on multisensory integration can be attributed to the absence of a miniaturized hardware platform capable of co&#8208;locating multiple sensing modalities and enabling in&#8208;sensor and near&#8208;sensor processing. In this study, we address this limitation by utilizing the chemo&#8208;sensing properties of graphene and the photo&#8208;sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to create a multisensory platform for visuochemical integration. Additionally, we leverage the in&#8208;memory&#8208;compute capability of MoS2 memtransistors to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision&#8208;making. Our visuochemical integration platform is inspired by intricate courtship of Heliconius butterflies, where female species rely on the integration of visual cues (such as wing color) and chemical cues (such as pheromones) generated by the male butterflies for mate selection. These butterflies also utilize visuochemical integration for foraging and predator avoidance. Our butterfly&#8208;inspired visuochemical integration platform has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing, going beyond unisensory intelligence and information processing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unisensory cues are often insufficient for animals to effectively engage in foraging, mating, and predatory activities. In contrast, the integration of cues collected from multiple sensory organs enhances the overall perceptual experience and thereby facilitates better decision-making. Despite the importance of multisensory integration in animals, the field of artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on processing unisensory information. This lack of emphasis on multisensory integration can be attributed to the absence of a miniaturized hardware platform capable of co-locating multiple sensing modalities and enabling in-sensor and near-sensor processing. In this study, we address this limitation by utilizing the chemo-sensing properties of graphene and the photo-sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to create a multisensory platform for visuochemical integration. Additionally, we leverage the in-memory-compute capability of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; memtransistors to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision-making. Our visuochemical integration platform is inspired by intricate courtship of Heliconius butterflies, where female species rely on the integration of visual cues (such as wing color) and chemical cues (such as pheromones) generated by the male butterflies for mate selection. These butterflies also utilize visuochemical integration for foraging and predator avoidance. Our butterfly-inspired visuochemical integration platform has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing, going beyond unisensory intelligence and information processing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Understanding and Utilizing Droplet Impact on Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Phenomena, Mechanisms, Regulations, Applications, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
(Droplet impact is a ubiquitous liquid behavior that closely tied to human life and production, making indispensable impacts on the big world. Nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces provide a powerful platform for regulating droplet impact dynamics. The collision between classic phenomena of droplet impact and the advanced manufacture of superhydrophobic surfaces is lighting up the future. Accurately understanding, predicting, and tailoring droplet dynamic behaviors on superhydrophobic surfaces are progressive steps to integrate the droplet impact into versatile applications and further improve the efficiency. In this Review, we comprehensively summarize the progress on phenomena, mechanisms, regulations and applications of droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces, bridging the gap between droplet impact, superhydrophobic surfaces, and engineering applications. We highlight that droplet contact and rebound are two focal points, and their fundamentals and dynamic regulations on elaborately designed superhydrophobic surfaces are discussed in detail. For the first time, diverse applications are classified into four categories according to the requirements for droplet contact and rebound. We also point out the remaining challenges and outline future directions to trigger subsequent research on droplet impact from both scientific and applied perspectives. Our review is expected to provide a general framework for understanding and utilizing droplet impact.)

         <title>Ultrathin Van Der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for Two&#8208;Dimensional Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high mobility two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, we successfully synthesized ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV/cm. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed van der Waals (vdW) interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. Our findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved the therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+ based nMOF (MIL&#8208;53) was used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy, but reduce the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, inclucing ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhanced dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combined it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>Communicating Supraparticles to Enable Perceptual, Information&#8208;Providing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e., (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized information providing additives, is presented. Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli&#8208;recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is obtained on demand.








Abstract
Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials. Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of considering materials as passive objects and turning them into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. This matter is capable of communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand. Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter by integrating customizable (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized communicating supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli&#8208;susceptible. Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli&#8208;recorder features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof, in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.

         <title>Bendable Silicene Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 2D silicene into bendable membranes allows investigating its optothermal and piezoresistive properties when external strain is applied on a micro and macroscale, thus representing an advance toward a new generation of flexible and fully silicon&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co&#8208;integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large&#8208;scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain&#8208;responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature&#8208;dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device&#8208;ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon&#8208;compatible technology framework.

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of 2D silicene into bendable membranes allows investigating its optothermal and piezoresistive properties when external strain is applied on a micro and macroscale, thus representing an advance toward a new generation of flexible and fully silicon-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their superior mechanical properties, 2D&#160;materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co-integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large-scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, it is reported on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native substrate and transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain-responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. It is also shown that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature-dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, it is demonstrated that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device-ready architectures, a piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon-compatible technology framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy Through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovaccine comprising cancer cell membrane, monophosphoryl lipid A, and anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (named CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28) activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells by interacting with both dendritic cells (DCs) and na&#239;ve T cells. CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 exhibits higher efficacy in tumor&#8208;specific T cell activation and tumor inhibition than nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or na&#239;ve T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28).








Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine is developed that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both the presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <dc:description>
Efficient surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is reported. The merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets and the microdroplet&#8208;assisted coupling of focused laser beams are demonstrated. Moreover, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved by leveraging the selective permeability of droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets.








Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation is proposed, where the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8211;oil and oil&#8211;Lithium niobate&#160;interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#181;W&#8208;level laser in oil media. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position is realized and the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings are demonstrated. To demonstrate its potential in photonic Micro&#8208;Electro&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;System assemblies, the end coupling of a focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface is demonstrated. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode characteristics.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors report a facile and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of pyrochlore iron (III) hydroxy fluoride (Pyr&#8208;IHF), enabling to produce Pyr&#8208;IHF at a low cost. Pyr&#8208;IHF&#8208;containing cathodes show superior capacity retention of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities, and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high costs of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8211;x(OH)x octahedra.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of the Gelated Tumor Interstitium around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;Targeting for Precise and Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma protein&#8208;like nanomedicine p(EK&#8208;co&#8208;C&#8208;SPA&#8208;ss&#8208;Dox) is developed to enable the integration of all&#8208;barrier&#8208;penetration with active targeting in a single nanodelivery system. Moreover, it is revealed both mechanisms: liquification of surrounding gelated water molecules by zwitterionic p(EK) shell to overcome diffusion barrier in polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor&#160;interstitium, and pH&#8208;triggered targeting to GD2&#8208;overexpressed solid tumor by a negative&#8208;biased zwitterionic shell of nanomedicine.








Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine is developed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to five times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over ten times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil by more than three times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <title>Flexible Optoelectronic Multimodal Proximity/Pressure/Temperature Sensors with Low Signal Interference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensors are proposed by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous structure. Self&#8208;decoupled sensing of proximity/pressure/temperature is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics. Negligible signal interference opens up promising paths for multimodal tactile sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity, and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithms hinder the actual applications. Here, this work reports a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibits a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7% &#176;C&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among colloidal quantum wells, self&#8208;assembled of the layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95% is successfully realized. Incorporation of the novel hole transfer layer PF8Cz effectively suppresses electron leakage, which leads to the high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.9%.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, is limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) are demonstrated. Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37% is successfully spin&#8208;coated. The devices exhibit a remarkable peak EQE of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55&#160;754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15&#160;000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. The work is expected to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Structure Simulation of Methylthiolated Peri&#8208;Condensed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Identifying Promising Molecular Semiconductors: Discovery of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene Showing Ultrahigh Mobility</title>

Material chemists pursue a way to identify ideal compounds to synthesize without wasting time on synthetic trials. A computational simulation method for crystal structures that identifies a promising molecular semiconductor, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene, among methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. Through experiments, its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors are confirmed to exhibit ultrahigh mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The crystal structures of molecular semiconductors critically affect their carrier&#8208;transport properties. One of the promising crystal structures that afford&#160;high carrier mobility is a brickwork structure recently reported for 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) showing ultrahigh mobility. However, such ultrahigh mobility is not realized in other methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, owing to subtle differences in the molecular positions in their crystal structures. This means that, for developing superior molecular semiconductors, it is desirable to simulate the crystal structure with sufficient quality before time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive synthetic trials. To realize this, a new computational approach is developed to simulate crystal structures of all methylchalocogenolated pyrenes, which is then applied to MT&#8208;pyrene&#8208;related methylthiolated peri&#8208;condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, peropyrene, and terrylene derivatives. Among these, 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)peropyrene (MT&#8208;peropyrene) is expected to show high mobility based on the simulated crystal structures. Thus, MT&#8208;peropyrene is chosen as the synthetic target, and a new peropyrene synthesis method is developed. Thus synthesized MT&#8208;peropyrene has virtually the same crystal structure as the simulated one, and its single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors show mobility as high as 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and band&#8208;like transport behaviors. These results indicate that the present crystal&#8208;structure simulation is a powerful tool for exploring promising molecular semiconductors.

         <title>Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Mixed&#8208;Cation Surface Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation system (CE) to synergically passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S&#8208;Q limit, and superior flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4&#8208;trifluoro phenethylammonium (CF3&#8208;PEA+, denoted as CA+) and ethylenediammonium (EDA2+, denoted as EA2+) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non&#8208;radiative recombination rate, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60&#160;&#176;C for 500&#160;h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators is a promising strategy to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs and corresponding POTSCs.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate&#8208;based multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and micro&#8208;texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Adsorption and Proton Chemistry of Ultra&#8208;Stabilized Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Manganese Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural stability strategy is proposed to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 in Zn&#8208;based aqueous devices and provide atomic insights. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism of proton chemistry and Zn ion surface adsorption in CoxMnO2 is revealed. Moreover, the mechanism of the influence of the anode selection on the surface adsorption process is studied.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zinc (Zn) batteries incorporating MnO2 cathodes possess favorable sustainability properties and are being considered for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, unstable electrode structures and unclear charge storage mechanisms limit their development. Here, advanced transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculations are utilized to study the working mechanisms of a Zn/MnO2 battery with a Co2+&#8208;stabilized, tunnel&#8208;structured &#945;&#8208;MnO2 cathode (CoxMnO2). It is shown that Co2+ can be pre&#8208;intercalated into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 and occupy the (2&#160;&#215;&#160;2) tunnel structure, which improves the structural stability of MnO2, facilitates the proton diffusion and Zn2+ adsorption on the MnO2 surface upon battery cycling. It is further revealed that for the MnO2 cathode, the charge storage reaction proceeds mainly by proton intercalation with the formation of &#945;&#8208;HyCoxMnO2, and that the anode design (with or without Zn metal) affects the surface adsorption of by&#8208;product Zn4SO4(OH)6&#183;nH2O on MnO2 surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of rechargeable Zn batteries and also sheds light on efficient electrode modifications toward performance enhancement.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal phosphide nanoparticles are prepared under mild conditions following a synthetic approach involving the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds in the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force for the reaction. The simplicity and versatility of this approach is demonstrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide (TMP) nanoparticles (NPs), and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8211;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M&#8208;Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide NPs using [RuCl2(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35 &#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru50P50 composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo50P50 and Co50P50 NPs can also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Engineering In Situ Catalytic Cleaning Membrane Via Prebiotic&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Mineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy is developed for aqueous dip&#8208;coating of catalytic nanomaterials onto the hydrophobic polymeric membrane at room temperature. The biomimetic mineralized superhydrophilic membrane enables the operando flux recovery beyond 99.8% and a ninefold higher flux recovery compared to the control one, attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. The mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which is attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves the way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.








Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>

A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Understanding Microstructural Development of Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>

The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;&#8208;cyanogroup&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8722;4&#8208;acyl acrylate and PbI2 during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).








Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. This article presents the development of an in situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature&#8208;controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm s&#8722;1) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared with 152&#160;nm s&#8722;1 and 37&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor of 82.78%. The bare device without any protection maintains 89% of its initial efficiency after 6600&#160;h of aging in ambient environment. This work implies that the in situ observation using fluorescence microscopy is a critical for understanding of crystallization kinetics in film devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l&#8208;CMSNs) performs better in the sequential oral absorption processes than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (Dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts via multiple chiral recognition mechanisms, and ultimately undertaking the responsibility of efficient oral drug delivery. These findings validate the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.








Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d&#8208;CMSNs) are fabricated via a one&#8208;pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l&#8208;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal approach is adopted to fabricate a new layered and strained Mn0.98Ir0.02O2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (sl&#8208;Mn0.98Ir0.02O2) with optimized electronic structure induced by Ir incorporation. The obtained strained nanosheets have only trace amount of Ir loading and exhibit the highest iridium mass activity (5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV).








Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation is developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#9472;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Conversion of Photodetector and Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on a Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN device is fabricated. According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics, Li anode corrosion, etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer, and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth, and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1244&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery toward realistic applications.

Chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated. The in vivo MRI results show D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs to enhance targeted enrichment in tumor tissue.








Abstract
The chemical, physical and biological effects of chiral nanomaterials have inspired general interest and demonstrated important advantages in fundamental science. Here, chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with g&#8208;factor of &#8776;2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm are fabricated, and these SPs act as high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated chiral Fe3O4 SPs have a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results show that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibit two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhances targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma and brain glioma tumors. Notably, it is found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs have 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncover that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
OPEN can effectively target IBD lesions and slowly release PFT&#945;. OPEN specifically targets p53 signaling, inhibits excessive apoptosis of IECs in IBD lesions, and plays a role in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier repair, anti&#8208;inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiome, while having good biocompatibility.








The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel electrolyte is adopted to bond interface water molecules to suppress water activity and alleviate water&#8208;induced side&#160;reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Due to the interface water bonding effect, symmetric Zn cells assemble with the BC hydrogel electrolyte cycle stably and deliver a high utilization rate (&gt;85%) of Zn anode under harsh test conditions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, this work shows that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembles with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and shows a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals. Intense multi&#8208;color circular polarized luminescence and circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are achieved, with high dissymmetry factors (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 and &#8722;1.57, respectively. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is further realized based on multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of N*&#8208;LCs.








Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, mainly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify the CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, the selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 is realized at 9&#160;wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of the selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with glum up to &#8722;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated by exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring of CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>3D Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 3D printed elastomer parts are prepared by using a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization system from high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin. After thermal treatment, the cross&#8208;linking polymerization of the chain extender and the unblocked isocyanate functional group effectively increases the molecular weight of the elastomer rendering a high mechanical performance (&#8776;a strain of 1600% and a stress of &#8776;26&#160;MPa).








Abstract
Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leveling agent of 4,6&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptopyrimidine (DMP) typically used in the copper electroplating industry is selected as a non&#8208;expendable electrolyte additive for Li metal anodes. The DMP leveler successfully adjusts the solvation structure due to strong coordination ability and absorbs on Li metal forming a functional molecular layer. Consequently, the Li deposition is flat, dendrite&#8208;free, and less by&#8208;products from interfacial side reactions.








Abstract
Li metal anodes are extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, is selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries are systematically investigated and they show stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent shows that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal can suppress side reactions and modify the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler does not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity and Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop CuS Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles
In article number 2306621, Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner, and co&#8208;workers report the preparation of metal phosphide nanoparticles through the reaction of metal chloride complexes with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. In the reaction, the release of the by&#8208;product SiClMe3 acts as a driving force. The exploitation of the strength of the Si&#8211;Cl bond as compared to many metal&#8211;Cl bonds is expected to provide easy access to a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles.

Mineralization Strategies
In article number 2306626, Xiaobin Yang, Seth B. Darling, Lu Shao, and co&#8208;workers report an aminomalononitrile/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy, inspired by prebiotic chemistry, for engineering a superhydrophilic coating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with robust catalytic cleaning ability. The entire fabrication of these coatings is performed in an aqueous buffer system and at ambient conditions. The biomimetic mineralized membranes exhibit substantially improved recovery after exposure to a fouling environment.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large&#8208;scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes.

&lt;p&gt;The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large-scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble-metal-based and noble metal-free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, views are offered on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8211;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardized stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely applied in optoelectronics and material sciences. In the past decade, molecular electrochemistry has emerged as a novel and robust tool for PAHs synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive survey on electrochemical assembly of PAHs largely by the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

         <title>Bioadhesives with Antimicrobial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research on bioadhesives is gaining new heights with the incorporation of innovative antimicrobial activity mechanisms. Strategies to achieve antimicrobial activity without compromise from biocompatibility, adhesion and cohesion are being devised. Unique approaches in the application of these bioadhesives and methods to reveal their elusive properties are diversifying. Bioadhesives are coming one step closer to replace many traditional surgical devices in the clinic.








Abstract
Bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties enable easier and safer treatment of wounds as compared to the traditional methods such as suturing and stapling. Composed of natural or synthetic polymers, these bioadhesives seal wounds and facilitate healing while preventing infections through the activity of locally released antimicrobial drugs, nanocomponents, or inherently antimicrobial polers. Although many different materials and strategies are employed to develop antimicrobial bioadhesives, the design of these biomaterials necessitates a prudent approach as achieving all the required properties including optimal adhesive and cohesive properties, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity can be challenging. Designing antimicrobial bioadhesives with tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties will shed light on the path for future advancement of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In this review, the requirements and commonly used strategies for developing bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties are discussed. In particular, different methods for their synthesis and their experimental and clinical applications on a variety of organs are reviewed. Advances in the design of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties will pave the way for a better management of wounds to increase positive clinical outcomes.

         <title>Soft Functionally Gradient Materials and Structures &#8211; Natural and Manmade: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft functionally gradient materials (FGM) having gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions are ideally suitable to manage interfacial stresses in dissimilar materials used in many emerging technologies for human interaction, such as soft robotics. The critical challenges in material, design, and fabrication methods are discussed in the context of the remarkable examples of natural FGMs.








Abstract
Functionally gradient materials (FGM) have gradual variations in their properties along one or more dimensions due to local compositional or structural distinctions by design. Traditionally, hard materials (e.g., metals, ceramics) are used to design and fabricate FGMs; however, there is increasing interest in polymer&#8208;based soft and compliant FGMs mainly because of their potential application in the human environment. Soft FGMs are ideally suitable to manage interfacial problems in dissimilar materials used in many emerging devices and systems for human interaction, such as soft robotics and electronic textiles and beyond. Soft systems are ubiquitous in everyday lives; they are resilient and can easily deform, absorb energy, and adapt to changing environments. Here, the basic design and functional principles of biological FGMs and their manmade counterparts are discussed using representative examples. The remarkable multifunctional properties of natural FGMs resulting from their sophisticated hierarchical structures, built from a relatively limited choice of materials, offer a rich source of new design paradigms and manufacturing strategies for manmade materials and systems for emerging technological needs. Finally, the challenges and potential pathways are highlighted to leverage soft materials' facile processability and unique properties toward functional FGMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been of considerable interest for energy harvesting, due to their high gravimetric surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. In this review, the working principles, applications, and challenges of CNT&#8208;based nanogenerators based on electrochemical, hydroelectric, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects are introduced.








Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. Here, various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded&#8208;growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.








Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;Partial chemicalization of mono- and bi-metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded-growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization-derived metal-semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution-processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical-chemical properties and functionalities.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Discharge Products in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is limited by the difficulty of discharge product (DP) decomposition because of their thermodynamical stability. This review revisits the impacts of discharge products on L&#8211;CO2 batteries, assesses advanced techniques for mechanism investigation of DP formation and decomposition, and reviews the main control methods for DP management to boost the Li&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries are promising devices for CO2 recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li2CO3) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progress has been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is reported for the first time. Fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs are appraised; impacts on battery performance including overpotential, capacity, and stability are demonstrated; and the necessity of discharge product management is highlighted. Practical in situ/operando technologies are assessed to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and promote practical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive materials are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8211;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution, and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photomodulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials are aimed to be systematically summarized and discussed. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution, and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8211;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.

         <title>Thermal Disorder&#8208;Induced Strain and Carrier Localisation Activate Reverse Halide Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The reversal of halide ions has been studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localisation of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) could be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS could eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice could mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W/cm2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder was estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain was 0.23%. However, in&#8208;situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increased the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in&#8208;situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects Toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess CO2 is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here we propose to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA/cm2 for over 120 hours. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 hours, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is around 19%.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny&#8221;, which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the negative capacitance in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, we focused on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II) and conducted a pioneering investigation on their negative capacitance responses. Our findings demonstrate that the negative capacitance exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny&#8221;, which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid-state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the negative capacitance in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, we focused on the fabricated high-quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II) and conducted a pioneering investigation on their negative capacitance responses. Our findings demonstrate that the negative capacitance exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next-generation electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Super&#8208;structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, And Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>

Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous PVA hydrogel as dissipative layer and in&#8208;situ photocuring technology for entangling PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, our hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of tough PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties simultaneously, our PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;induced Regulation of Pt Strain Derived from Pt3Ga Intermetallic for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pt&#8208;based fuel cell catalysts with excellent activity and stability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been developed through strain regulation in recent years. Herein, we demonstrated that symmetry&#8208;induced strain regulation of Pt surface of PtGa intermetallic compounds can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With the strain environment varies derived from the lattice mismatch of analogous PtGa core but different symmetry, the Pt surface of the PtGa alloy and the Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) precisely realized 0.58% and 2.7% compressive strain compared to the Pt3Ga (P4/mmm. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that when the compressive stress of the Pt lattice increases, the desorption process of O* intermediates becomes accelerated, which is conducive to oxygen reduction. The Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) with high symmetry and compressive Pt surface exhibited the highest mass and specific activities of 2.18 A&#8901;mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.36 mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, respectively, which were more than one order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. We demonstrated that material symmetry can be used to precisely modulate Pt surface stress to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, as well as provide a distinct platform to investigate the relationship between Pt compressibility and catalytic activity.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling Dendrite&#8208;free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries can address crucial challenges regarding insufficient battery cycling life and energy density. The demonstration of long&#8208;cycling dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries requires precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). In this work, we report a proof of concept for precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of a halide SSE, Li3InCl6, including intragranular (within grains) but also intergranular (between grains) lithium&#8208;ion transport. Lithium&#8208;ion migration tailoring mechanism in crystals is developed by unexpected enhanced Li, In, and Cl vacancy populations and lower energy barrier for hopping. The lithium&#8208;ion transport tailoring mechanism between the grains is determined by the elimination of voids between grains and the formation of unexpected supersonic conducting grain boundaries, boosting the lithium dendrite suppression ability of SSE. Due to boosted lithium&#8208;ion conduction and dendrite&#8208;suppression ability, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries coupled with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes and lithium metal anodes demonstrated breakthroughs in electrochemical performance by achieving extremely long cycling life at a high current density of 0.5 C (2000 cycles, 93.7% capacity retention). This concept of precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport provides a cost, time, and energy efficient solution to conquer the remaining challenges in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries for fast developing electric vehicle markets.

Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as powerful building blocks to develop various soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, superior bio&#8208;compatibility, the ability to conduct both electrons and ions, and multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. However, hydrogels are vulnerable to mechanical damage, which limits their usage in developing durable hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics. Self&#8208;healing hydrogels aim to endow bioelectronics with the property of repairing specific functions after mechanical failure, thus improving their durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in self&#8208;healing hydrogels, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, material chemistry, and strategies for multiple properties improvement of hydrogel materials, to the design, fabrication, and applications of various hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics, including wearable physical and biochemical sensors, supercapacitors, flexible display devices, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), implantable bioelectronics, etc. Furthermore, the persisting challenges hampering the development of self&#8208;healing hydrogel bioelectronics and their prospects are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the research and applications of self&#8208;healing hydrogels for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.

         <title>Highly Stable Layered Coordination Polymer Electrocatalyst Towards Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cu2+&#8208;based materials, a class of promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals, usually undergo inevitable and uncontrollable reorganization processes during the reaction, resulting in catalyst deactivation or the new active sites formation and bringing great challenges to exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, a facile strategy is reported for constructing Cu2+ and 3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) coordination to stabilize Cu2+ ions to prepare a novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT). CuPEDOT enables selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 with 62.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at the current density of 354&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, and the catalyst is stable for at least 15&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu2+&#8208;EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO2RR, and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH4 instead of dimerization to C2 products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu2+ prevents the reduction of Cu2+ ions during CO2RR. Our finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO2RR.

In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; instead of dimerization to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; prevents the reduction of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Our finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tandem Catalysis Inside Double&#8211;shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8211;sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8211;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here we have developed double&#8211;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8211;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8211;N4 and outer Zn&#8211;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#956;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8211;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Injectable Self&#8208;Expanding/Self&#8208;Propelling Hydrogel Adhesive with Procoagulant Activity and Rapid Gelation for Lethal Massive Hemorrhage Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing hydrogels that can quickly reach deep bleeding sites, adhere to wounds, and expand to stop lethal and/or noncompressible bleeding in civil and battlefield environments remains a challenge. Herein, we report an injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding, and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel bioadhesive with procoagulant activity and rapid gelation. This hydrogel combines spontaneous gas foaming and rapid Schiff base crosslinking for lethal massive hemorrhage. Hydrogels have rapid gelation and expansion rate, high self&#8208;expanding ratio, excellent antibacterial activity, antioxidant efficiency, and tissue adhesion capacity. In addition, hydrogels have good cytocompatibility, procoagulant ability, and higher blood cell/platelet adhesion activity than commercial combat gauze and gelatin sponge. The optimized hydrogel (OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30) exhibits better hemostatic ability than combat gauze and gelatin sponge in rat liver and femoral artery bleeding models, rabbit volumetric liver loss massive bleeding models with/without anticoagulant, and rabbit liver and kidney incision bleeding models with bleeding site not visible. Especially, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 rapidly stops the bleedings from pelvic area of rabbit, and swine subclavian artery vein transection. Furthermore, OD&#8208;C/QGQL&#8208;A30 has biodegradability and biocompatibility, and accelerates MRSA&#8208;infected skin wound healing. This injectable, antibacterial, self&#8208;expanding and self&#8208;propelling hydrogel opens up a new avenue to develop hemostats for lethal massive bleeding, abdominal organ bleeding, and bleeding from coagulation lesions.

         <title>Dislodgement of Hydrogen Bubbles in Microchannels with Embedded Pillars: An Analytical, Experimental, and Numerical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microchannels with integrated pillars have enhanced the production capabilities and performance of various applications due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. However, emerging gas bubbles can become trapped, potentially limiting the functionality or efficiency of the device when scaled down to the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Understanding the conditions required to dislodge these bubbles is thus critical for optimizing microfluidic devices with complex physical behaviors. This study presents an analytical model that outlines the dislodgment conditions and driving forces for such gas&#8211;liquid flows. These terms are derived from the gas&#8211;liquid interface properties, geometry, and processing parameters. As the density of the pillar arrangement is scaled down, the resistance to bubble dislodgment typically increases. Nevertheless, the bubble is compelled to dislodge at lower pressure loads when critical volumes are reached. This newly discovered effect is particularly noticeable in densely packed arrays and can be explained by the interplay of increased surface tension, geometrical restrictions, and volume&#8208;preserving forces. The analytical terms and effects are validated through novel experimental and numerical methods tailored for microchannels in the low&#8208;micrometer scale, showing strong agreement.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multi&#8208;Scale, Multi&#8208;Composition, and Multi&#8208;Dimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous attention in academia and industries as a lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, their limited mechanical durability hinders their processing and operation, particularly in application requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as the potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced to enhance the mechanical strength of aerogels in the last decade, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches in the past 10 years. Additionally, new trends and future technologies for the commercialization of aerogels as much as plastic is discussed in the final section.

         <title>Facilitating Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Orbital Hybridization for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: Marvelous Air Stability, Controllable High Voltage, And Anion Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered oxides have become the research focus of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low cost, simple synthesis process, and high specific capacity. However, the poor air stability, unsteady phase structure under high voltage, and slow anionic redox kinetics hinder their commercial application. In recent years, the concept of manipulating orbital hybridization has been proposed to simultaneously tune the microelectronic structure and modify the surface chemistry environment intrinsically. In this review, the hybridization modes between atoms in 3d/4d transition metal (TM) orbitals and O 2p orbitals near the region of the Fermi energy level (EF) were summarized based on orbital hybridization theory and first&#8208;principles calculations as well as various sophisticated characterizations. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms are explored from macro&#8208;scale to micro&#8208;scale, including enhancing air stability, modulating high voltage, and stabilizing anionic redox chemistry. Meanwhile, the origin, formation conditions, and different types of orbital hybridization, as well as its application in layered oxide cathodes are presented, which provide insights into the design and preparation of cathode materials. Ultimately, the main challenges in the development of orbital hybridization and its potential for the production application are also discussed, pointing out the route for high&#8208;performance practical sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Straightforward Design Strategy Towards 3D Near&#8208;Net&#8208;Shape Stoichiometric Sic Parts</title>

Abstract
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), traditionally reserved for thermoplastics, is extending here to advanced non&#8208;oxide ceramics via a straightforward design strategy by considering the shaping and chemical richness offered by preceramic polymers. Specifically, 3D near net shape stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) objects are designed by manipulating the key features of a commercially available polycarbosilane (fusibility, high carbon content, relatively high SiC yield). In the early stage of the process, the carbon&#8208;rich polycarbosilane is first mixed with Si and SiC fillers and then thermolyzed at 120&#176;C to increase polymer branching while offering tailored rheological properties during micro&#8208;extrusion and providing adequate shape retention once extruded. This allowed for the design of tailored and complex 3D complex polymer architectures with features down to 400&#160;&#956;m. The complex polymer parts are further converted into 3D stoichiometric SiC objects with quasi&#8208;near&#8208;net&#8208;shape &#8211; a volume shrinkage reduced to 9.1% has been measured &#8211; by heat&#8208;treatment at a temperature as low as 1400&#176;C (argon flow). Given the flexibility to tune the preceramic polymer chemical and rheological properties, a new combined design approach is leveraged to generate bespoke advanced ceramics with a high freedom in geometry complexity.

         <title>Phase Selection Rules of Multi&#8208;Principal Element Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Computational prediction of phase stability of multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) holds a lot of promise for rapid exploration of the enormous design space and autonomous discovery of superior structural and functional properties. Regardless of many plausible works that rely on phenomenological theory and machine learning, precise prediction is still limited by insufficient data and the lack of interpretability of some machine learning algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural network. In this work, we have presented a comprehensive approach, encompassing the development of a complete dataset that contains 72,387 density functional theory calculations, as well as a predictive global phenomenological descriptor. The phase selection descriptor, based on atomic electronegativity and valence electron concentration, significantly outperforms the widely used valence electron concentration, excelling in both accuracy (with an F1 score of 63% compared to 47%) and its ability to predict the HCP phase (0.48 recall compared to 0). The comprehensive data mining on the global design space of 61,425 quaternary MPEAs made from 28 possible metals, together with the phenomenological theory and physical interpretation, will set up a solid computational science foundation for data&#8208;driven exploration of MPEAs.

         <title>Unrestricted Chiral Patterning by Laser Writing in Liquid Crystalline and Plasmonic Nanocomposite Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obtaining hierarchical structures with arbitrarily controlled chirality remains a challenge since the commonly used chiral building blocks favor chiral randomness throughout length scales. Here, we obtain chiroptically bipolar patterned thin films by introducing an autonomous device for microscale photothermal re&#8208;melting of materials exhibiting chirality synchronization. The device operates on an algorithm that reads, identifies, and controls the recrystallization of the film, facilitating the homochiral growth of supramolecular organic helices. Owing to the molecular achirality of the individual molecules and local chirality synchronization, both handednesses of the helices are available, enabling unrestricted chiral writing in the film. The collective chiroptical response of assembled molecules is used for guiding the patterning process, thus creating a foundation for optically secured information. Established methodology enabled achieving dissymmetry factor values for circular dichroism a magnitude higher than previously reported, as confirmed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, synchrotron&#8208;based Mueller matrix polarimetry. Moreover, we apply the developed method to nanocomposites comprising gold nanoparticles, providing the opportunity to tune the circular dichroism towards the plasmonic region. Our strategy uncovers the potential of photothermal processing by laser&#8208;directed melting, widening the selection of nanostructured materials with precisely designed chiroptical functionalities for photonic applications.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process is exploited to derive lanthanide organic framework (Tb&#8208;cpon) modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced performance under UV irradiation. Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit rapid response and reduced degradation due to energy down&#8208;conversion facilitated by effective coupling of UV&#8208;sensitive chromophores to lanthanide luminescent centers, enhancing the spectral response range of the composite films. Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb&#8208;cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb&#8208;cpon modified PSC devices obtained a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.

         <title>Recent Advances in Room Temperature Phosphorescence Metal&#8208;Organic Hybrids: Structures, Properties And Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic hybrid (MOH) materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have drawn numerous attentions in recent years due to their superior RTP properties of high phosphorescence efficiency and ultralong emission lifetime. Great achievement has been realized in developing MOH materials with high&#8208;performance RTP, but a systematic study on MOH materials with RTP feature is lacking. In this review, we highlighted recent advances in metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials. The molecular packing, the photophysical properties and their applications of metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials were discussed in detail. Metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials can be divided into six parts: coordination polymers, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), metal&#8208;halide hybrids, organic ionic crystals, organic ionic polymers, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. These RTP materials have been successfully applied in time&#8208;resolved data encryption, fingerprint recognition, information logic gate, X&#8208;ray image and photo&#8208;memory. This review not only provides the basic principle of designing RTP metal&#8208;organic hybrids, but also propounds the research prospect of RTP metal&#8208;organic hybrids in the future. This review offers many effective strategies for developing metal&#8208;organic hybrids with excellent RTP properties, thus satisfying the practical applications.

         <title>New Nanophotonics Approaches for Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has experienced a remarkable ascent, soaring from 3.8% in 2009 to a remarkable record of 26.1% in 2023. Many recent approaches for improving PSC performance employ nanophotonic technologies, from light harvesting and thermal management to the manipulation of charge carrier dynamics. Plasmonic nanoparticles (NP) and arrayed dielectric nanostructures have been applied to tailor the light absorption, scattering, and conversion, as well as the heat dissipation within PSCs to improve their PCE and operational stability. In this review, we begin with a concise introduction to define the realm of nanophotonics by focusing on the nanoscale interactions between light and surface plasmons or dielectric photonic structures. We then elaborate on the prevailing strategies that utilize resonance&#8208;enhanced light&#8208;matter interactions for boosting the PCE and stability of PSCs from light trapping, carrier transportation and thermal management perspectives, and discuss the resultant practical applications, such as semi&#8208;transparent photovoltaics (PV), colored PSCs, and smart perovskite windows. Finally, we review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanophotonic paradigms in PSCs, and highlight the benefits of these approaches in improving the aesthetic effects and energy&#8208;saving character of PSC&#8208;integrated buildings.

         <title>The Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as example, we herein illustrate how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on Zn metal anode. The in&#8208;situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups have been constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which has improved the electrochemical performance of Zn||V2O5 full cell. DFT calculations combined with water contact angle measurements demonstrated that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water contact angle and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how excellent reversibility has been achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIBs anode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)-modified Cu@Zn (SA-Cu@Zn) anode as example, we herein illustrate how the lotus effect controls the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption energy on Zn metal anode. The &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long-chain alkyl groups have been constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA-Cu@Zn anode exhibits long-term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which has improved the electrochemical performance of Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell. DFT calculations combined with water contact angle measurements demonstrated that the SA-Cu@Zn exhibits larger water contact angle and weaker H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA-Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how excellent reversibility has been achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIBs anode.&lt;/p&gt;
