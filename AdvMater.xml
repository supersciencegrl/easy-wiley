         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries have aroused great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention has been paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced, and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency of 92.6%, surpassing to those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance N&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, we demonstrate that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#956;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#956;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nM and decent selectivity was further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

         <title>Review &#8212; Extremely Thin Amorphous Indium Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductor transistors have been a mature technology in display panels for upwards of a decade, and have recently been considered as promising back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible channel materials for monolithic 3D applications. However, achieving high&#8208;mobility amorphous semiconductor materials with comparable performance to traditional crystalline semiconductors has been a long&#8208;standing problem. Recently it has been found that greatly reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high mobility, high drive current, high on/off ratio, and enhancement&#8208;mode operation at the same time, beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductor materials. In this work, we review the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices.

         <title>Reinforcing The Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as co&#8208;solvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the co&#8208;solvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal co&#8208;solvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#956;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. In contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Temperature Electronic Skin Based on Island&#8208;Bridge Structure And Bi&#8208;Te Micro Thermoelectric Generator for Distributed Mini&#8208;Region Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect based temperature sensor can accurately convert temperature signal into voltage without external power supply, which have great application prospects in self&#8208;powered temperature electronic skin (STES). But the fabrication of stretchable and distributed STES still remains a challenge. Here, a novel STES design strategy is proposed by combining flexible island&#8208;bridge structure with BiTe&#8208;based micro thermoelectric generator (&#956;&#8208;TEG). Furthermore, a 4&#215;4 vertical temperature sensor array with good stretchability and distributed sensing property has been fabricated for the first time. The interfacial chemical bonds located between the rigid islands (&#956;&#8208;TEG) and the flexible substrate (PDMS) endow the STES with excellent stretchability, and its sensing performance remains unchanged under 30% strain (the maximum strain of human skin). Moreover, the STES sensing unit possesses high sensitivity (729 &#956;V/K), rapid response time (0.157 s) and high spatial resolution (2.75&#215;2.75 mm2). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of the STES in the detection of mini&#8208;region heat sources in various scenarios including non&#8208;contact spatial temperature responsing, intelligent robotic thermosensing and wearable temperature sensing. Such an inspiring design strategy is expected to provide guidance for the design and fabrication of wearable self&#8208;powered temperature sensors.

Such an inspiring design strategy is expected to provide guidance for the design and fabrication of wearable self-powered temperature sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells And Tandems</title>

Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulphonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors. Our method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV&#8208;bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semi&#8208;transparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV&#8208;bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive efficiency of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multi&#8208;junction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>Over&#8208;Stoichiometric Metastabilization of Cation&#8208;Disordered Rock Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over&#8208;stoichiometric metastabilization of cation&#8208;disordered rock salts allows relaxation of the site balance constraint of rock salt structures. It stimulates more unlocked redox activity, induces more cation disordering, and changes the energy storage mechanisms. The route can greatly expand the synthesizable chemical space of cation disorder rock salts and allows new opportunities to explore higher electrochemical performance within the chemical space.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rock salts (DRXs) are well known for their potential to realize the goal of achieving scalable Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;free high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries. Unlike in most cathode materials, the disordered cation distribution may lead to more factors that control the electrochemistry of DRXs. An important variable that is not emphasized by research community is regarding whether a DRX exists in a more thermodynamically stable form or a more metastable form. Moreover, within the scope of metastable DRXs, over&#8208;stoichiometric DRXs, which allow relaxation of the site balance constraint of a rock salt structure, are particularly underexplored. In this work, these findings are reported in locating a generally applicable approach to &#8220;metastabilize&#8221; thermodynamically stable Mn&#8208;based DRXs to metastable ones by introducing Li over&#8208;stoichiometry. The over&#8208;stoichiometric metastabilization greatly stimulates more redox activities, enables better reversibility of Li deintercalation/intercalation, and changes the energy storage mechanism. The metastabilized DRXs can be transformed back to the thermodynamically stable form, which also reverts the electrochemical properties, further contrasting the two categories of DRXs. This work enriches the structural and compositional space of DRX families and adds new pathways for rationally tuning the properties of DRX cathodes.

         <title>Extensible Integrated System for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Cardiovascular Physiological Signals and Limb Health</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensible integrated systems based on perovskite photodetector are very lightweight and have excellent shape adaptability, which not only can overcome the brittleness of rigid device, but also has good mechanical protection and electrical interconnection structure to adapt to disturbances caused by deformation. This work develops a promising approach for extracting pulse wave signals that can reflect human health status.








Abstract
In recent decades, the rapid growth in flexible materials, new manufacturing technologies, and wearable electronics design techniques has helped establish the foundations for noninvasive photoelectric sensing systems with shape&#8208;adaptability and &#8220;skin&#8208;like&#8221; properties. Physiological sensing includes humidity, mechanical, thermal, photoelectric, and other aspects. Photoplethysmography (PPG), an important noninvasive method for measuring pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen, uses the attenuated signal obtained by the light absorbed and reflected from living tissue to a light source to realize real&#8208;time monitoring of human health status. This work illustrates a patch&#8208;type optoelectronic system that integrates a flexible perovskite photodetector and all&#8208;inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) to realize the real&#8208;time monitoring of human PPG signals. The pulse rate of the human body and the swelling degree of finger joints can be extracted and analyzed using photodetectors, thus monitoring human health for the prevention and early diagnosis of certain diseases. Specifically, this work develops a 3D wrinkled&#8208;serpentine interconnection wire that increases the shape adaptability of the device in practical applications. The PPG signal sensor reported in this study has considerable potential for future wearable intelligent medical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>

Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valance Nb5+ element, we achieved a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh/kg and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>&#8220;Ice and Fire&#8221; Supramolecular Cell&#8208;Conjugation Drug Delivery Platform for Deep Tumor Ablation and Boosted Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ice cell &amp; fire nanomedicine&#8221; supramolecular cell conjugates are reported for combined photothermal/gas therapy/immunotherapy, allowing deep tumor tissue ablation and stimulation of immunity to suppress distant tumor and lung metastasis after only one treatment in vivo.








Abstract
Cancer recurrence and metastasis are two major challenges in the current clinical therapy. In this work, a novel diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based photothermal reagent (DCN) with unique J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced redshift is synthesized to achieve efficient tumor thermal ablation under safe power (0.33&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is co&#8208;loaded with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing DCN in amphiphilic polymers to realize heat&#8208;induced massive release of nitric oxide (NO), which can form oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) to active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby degrading the compact tumor extracellular matrix to improve the ablation depth and infiltration of immune cells. Through a facile supramolecular assembly method, the DCN/SNAP nanoparticles are anchored to liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;frozen cancer cells, achieving enhanced antitumor immune responses and effective inhibition of distant tumors and pulmonary metastases after only one treatment. The safety and effectiveness of this supramolecular cell&#8208;conjugation platform are verified by 2D/3D cellular experiments and bilateral tumor model, confirming the thermal&#8208;ablation&#8211;gas&#8208;permeation&#8211;antigen&#8208;presentation therapeutic mode has promising anticancer prospects.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer recurrence and metastasis are two major challenges in the current clinical therapy. In this work, a novel diketopyrrolopyrrole-based photothermal reagent (DCN) with unique J-aggregation-induced redshift is synthesized to achieve efficient tumor thermal ablation under safe power (0.33&#160;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Meanwhile, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitroso-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is co-loaded with near-infrared-absorbing DCN in amphiphilic polymers to realize heat-induced massive release of nitric oxide (NO), which can form oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby degrading the compact tumor extracellular matrix to improve the ablation depth and infiltration of immune cells. Through a facile supramolecular assembly method, the DCN/SNAP nanoparticles are anchored to liquid-nitrogen-frozen cancer cells, achieving enhanced antitumor immune responses and effective inhibition of distant tumors and pulmonary metastases after only one treatment. The safety and effectiveness of this supramolecular cell-conjugation platform are verified by 2D/3D cellular experiments and bilateral tumor model, confirming the thermal-ablation&#8211;gas-permeation&#8211;antigen-presentation therapeutic mode has promising anticancer prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Neural Activation and Neuromorphic Processing via Drain&#8208;injection Threshold&#8208;switching Float Gate Transistor Memory</title>

Abstract
Hetero&#8208;modulated neural activation is vital for adaptive information processing and learning that occurs in brain. To implement brain&#8208;inspired adaptive processing, previously various neuro&#8208;transistors oriented for synaptic functions had been extensively explored, however, the emulation of nonlinear neural activation and hetero&#8208;modulated behaviors had been not possible due to the lack of threshold switching behavior in a conventional transistor structure. Here, we report a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW) float gate transistor (FGT) that exhibits steep threshold switching behavior, and the emulation of hetero&#8208;modulated neuron functions (integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, sigmoid type activation) for adaptive sensory processing. Unlike conventional FGTs, the threshold switching behavior stems from impact ionization in channel and the coupled charge injection to float gate. When a threshold is met, a sub&#8208;30&#160;mV/dec increase of transistor conductance by more than four orders is triggered with a typical switch time of &#8764;milliseconds. Essentially, by feeding light sensing signal as the modulation input, we demonstrate that two typical tasks that relies on adaptive neural activation, including collision avoidance and adaptive visual perception, can be realized. Our results may shed light on the emulation of rich hetero&#8208;modulating behaviors in biological neurons and the realization of biomimetic neuromorphic processing at low hardware cost.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, we report that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100,000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron transfer and ion transport is required.

         <title>Interlocking&#8208;Governed Ultra&#8208;Strong and Highly Conductive MXene Fibers Through Fluidics&#8208;Assisted Thermal Drawing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluidics&#8208;assisted thermal drawing stresses reduce the voids and align the MXene (Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx) nanosheets to directly achieve ultra&#8208;strong and highly conductive MXene fiber with tablet interfacial interlocks. Indeed, the interlocking&#8208;governed interfacial interaction significantly enhances the fundamental understanding of nanoscale material engineering.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance MXene fibers are always of significant interest for flexible textile&#8208;based devices. However, achieving high mechanical property and electrical conductivity remains challenging due to the uncontrolled loose microstructures of MXene (Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx) nanosheets. Herein, high&#8208;performance MXene fibers directly obtained through fluidics&#8208;assisted thermal drawing are demonstrated. Tablet interlocks are formed at the interface layer between the outer cyclic olefin copolymer and inner MXene nanosheets due to the thermal drawing induced stresses, resulting in thousands of meters long macroscopic compact MXene fibers with ultra&#8208;high tensile strength, toughness, and outstanding electrical conductivity. Further, large&#8208;scale woven textiles constructed by these fibers offer exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance with excellent durability and stability. Such an effective and sustainable approach can be applied to produce functional fibers for applications in both daily life and aerospace.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8208;Free O3&#8208;Type Layered Oxyfluoride: A Promising Air&#8208;Stable Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy approach is employed to design an advanced cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by combining elements of different traits to overcome the inhibitions of complex phase transition, inferior capacity, sluggish kinetics, and poor air stability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;based batteries, driven by an ever&#8208;growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;capacity cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, synthesized using a high&#8208;entropy approach. The high&#8208;entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long&#8208;term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is&#160;introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4&#160;V) and 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4.3&#160;V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high&#8208;entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high&#8208;entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;BD&lt;/sub&gt;) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass-transport index (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt;) and the charge-transfer index (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;charge&lt;/sub&gt;) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;BD&lt;/sub&gt; and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;BD&lt;/sub&gt;, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 473&#160;Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in an Ah-level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high-energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Dye&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence by Enhanced Short&#8208;Range Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed to enhance the dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized upconversion emission by modifying the coordination sites on the conjugated structure of cyanine molecules. This strategy significantly improves the energy transfer efficiency between organic dyes and lanthanide ions Yb3+, and can be applied to both 808 and 730 nm dye&#8208;sensitization systems.








Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitization can enhance lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence, but is hindered by interfacial energy transfer from organic dye to lanthanide ion Yb3+. To overcome these limitations, modifying coordination sites on dye conjugated structures and minimizing the distance between fluorescence cores and Yb3+ in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are proposed. The specially designed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye, disulfo&#8208;indocyanine green (disulfo&#8208;ICG), acts as the antenna molecule and exhibits a 2413&#8208;fold increase in luminescence under 808&#160;nm excitation compared to UCNPs alone using 980&#160;nm irradiation. The significant improvement is attributed to the high energy transfer efficiency of 72.1% from disulfo&#8208;ICG to Yb3+ in UCNPs, with majority of energy originating from triplet state (T1) of disulfo&#8208;ICG. Shortening the distance between the dye and lanthanide ions increases the probability of energy transfer and strengthens the heavy atom effect, leading to enhanced T1 generation and improved dye&#8208;triplet sensitization upconversion. Importantly, this approach also applies to 730&#160;nm excitation Cy7&#8208;SO3 sensitization system, overcoming the spectral mismatch between Cy7 and Yb3+ and achieving a 52&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence. Furthermore, the enhancement of upconversion at single particle level through dye&#8208;sensitization is demonstrated. This strategy expands the range of NIR dyes for sensitization and opens new avenues for highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Liquid&#8208;Repellent and Thermal&#8211;Wet Comfortable Membranes Using Triboelectric Nanostructured Nanofiber/Meshes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust strategy to synthesize an antisymmetric wetting nanoarchitectured meshwork via a novel electromeshing technique is reported. By combining the true nanoscale diameter (&#8776;22&#160;nm), small pore size, and high porosity, both high waterproofness and breathability for the membranes are achieved. Moreover, integration of hydrophilic wicking and triboelectric field polarization endows the materials with satisfactory water evaporation rate (0.64&#160;g h&#8722;1).








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like functional membranes with liquid resistance and moisture permeability are in growing demand in various applications. However, the membranes have been facing a long&#8208;term dilemma in balancing waterproofness and breathability, as well as resisting internal liquid sweat transport, resulting in poor thermal&#8211;wet comfort. Herein, a novel electromeshing technique, based on manipulating the ejection and phase separation of charged liquids, is developed to create triboelectric nanostructured nano&#8208;mesh consisting of hydrophobic ferroelectric nanofiber/meshes and hydrophilic nanofiber/meshes. By combining the true nanoscale diameter (&#8776;22&#160;nm), small pore size, and high porosity, high waterproofness (129&#160;kPa) and breathability (3736&#160;g m&#8722;2 per day) for the membranes are achieved. Moreover, the membranes can break large water clusters into small water molecules to promote sweat absorption and release by coupling hydrophilic wicking and triboelectric field polarization, exhibiting a satisfactory water evaporation rate (0.64&#160;g h&#8722;1) and thermal&#8211;wet comfort (0.7&#160;&#176;C cooler than the cutting&#8208;edge poly(tetrafluoroethylene) protective membranes). This work may shed new light on the design and development of advanced protective textiles.

         <title>Tuneable Anisotropic Plasmonics with Shape&#8208;Symmetric Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional anisotropic nanoantennas have asymmetric shape. In this work, symmetry is instead broken by straining of a conducting polymer, leading to an in&#8208;plane anisotropic plasma frequency. This enables circularly symmetric nanoantennas with polarization&#8208;dependent localized surface plasmon resonances. The polarization dependence is consistent with inverse changes of the effective mass and mobility of thecharge carriers along different in&#8208;plane directions.








Abstract
A wide range of nanophotonic applications rely on polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances, which usually requires metallic nanostructures that have anisotropic shape. This work demonstrates polarization&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances instead by breaking symmetry via material permittivity. The study shows that molecular alignment of a conducting polymer can lead to a material with polarization&#8208;dependent plasma frequency and corresponding in&#8208;plane hyperbolic permittivity region. This result is not expected based only on anisotropic charge mobility but implies that also the effective mass of the charge carriers becomes anisotropic upon polymer alignment. This unique feature is used to demonstrate circularly symmetric nanoantennas that provide different plasmonic resonances parallel and perpendicular to the alignment direction. The nanoantennas are further tuneable via the redox state of the polymer. Importantly, polymer alignment could blueshift the plasma wavelength and resonances by several hundreds of nanometers, forming a novel approach toward reaching the ultimate goal of redox&#8208;tunable conducting polymer nanoantennas for visible light.

         <title>A Counterion&#8208;Free Strategy for Chronic Metabolic Acidosis Based on an Orally Administered Gut&#8208;Restricted Inorganic Adsorbent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABC&#8208;350, an orally&#8208;administered gut&#8208;restricted adsorbent, is derived from bismuth subcarbonate annealing. It selectively adsorbs H+ and Cl&#8722; in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting HCO3&#8722; release into circulation to alleviate metabolic acidosis. This effect also delays renal damage, highlighting the potential for improved treatment outcomes.








Abstract
Chronic metabolic acidosis, arising as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), not only reduces patients&#8217; quality of life but also aggravates renal impairment. The only available therapeutic modality, involving intravenous infusion of NaHCO3, engenders undesirable sodium retention, thereby increasing hemodynamic load and seriously exacerbating the primary disease. This deleterious cascade extends to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, an orally administered, gut&#8208;restricted inorganic adsorbent that can effectively alleviate chronic metabolic acidosis without causing any electrolytic derangement or superfluous cardiovascular strain is developed. The genesis of ABC&#8208;350 entails the engineering of bismuth subcarbonate via annealing, thereby yielding a partially &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;doped (BiO)2CO3 biphasic crystalline structure framework enriched with atomic vacancies. ABC&#8208;350 can selectively remove chloride ions and protons from the gastrointestinal tract, mimicking the physiological response to gastric acid removal and resulting in increased serum bicarbonate. Owing to its gut&#8208;restricted nature, ABC&#8208;350 exhibits commendable biosafety, averting undue systemic exposure. In two rat models of metabolic acidosis, ABC&#8208;350 emerges not only as a potent mitigator of acidosis but also effects discernible amelioration concerning proximal tubular morphology, interstitial fibrosis, and the incendiary cascades incited by metabolic acidosis. ABC&#8208;350, as the translationally relevant material, provides a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.

         <title>Healable Ionic Conductors with Extremely Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High Mechanical Strength Enabled by Hydrophobic Domain&#8208;Locked Reversible Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversibly cross&#8208;linked stretchable ionic conductors with extremely low&#8208;hysteresis, high mechanical strength, and toughness are fabricated by locking noncovalent interactions within hydrophobic domains. The ionic conductor can maintain its original strength and elasticity during 5000 cycles of uninterrupted loading&#8211;unloading tests at 200% strain. The fractured ionic conductors can be conveniently healed to restore their original mechanical properties and conductivity.








Abstract
Extremely low hysteresis, high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and excellent healability are essential for stretchable ionic conductors to enhance their reliability and meet for cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the fabrication of stretchable ionic conductors with such mutually exclusive properties remains challenging. Herein, extremely low&#8208;hysteresis and healable ionic conductors with a tensile strength of &#8776;8.9&#160;MPa and toughness of &#8776;23.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 are fabricated through the complexation of 4&#8208;carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (denoted as PVA&#8208;CBA) and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) followed by acidification and ion&#8208;loading steps. The acidification step generates the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors with in situ formed dynamic hydrophobic domains that lock and stabilize noncovalent interactions. This significantly minimizes the energy dissipation of the ionic conductors during cyclic mechanical loading (&#8804;200% strain), resulting in ionic conductors with extremely low hysteresis (&#8776;5%). The fractured ionic conductors can be healed at 60&#160;&#176;C to restore their original properties. Because of the extremely low hysteresis, the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors show a highly stable and reproducible electrical response over 5000 uninterrupted loading&#8211;unloading cycles at a strain of 200%. The ionic conductor based sensors exhibit a high sensitivity to a wide range of strains (1&#8211;500%).

         <title>Engineering Atomic&#8208;Scale Patterning and Resistive Switching in 2D Crystals and Application in Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning design provides extra degrees of freedom to realize tailored material properties and device functionality. This research demonstrates that scalable atomic&#8208;scale patterning and controllable resistive switching can be realized in 2D superionic cuprous telluride by using the bonding difference at nonequivalent sites, and proposes a compact model for mimicking the memristor dynamics that can be used for image processing.








Abstract
The ultrathin thickness of 2D layered materials affords the control of their properties through defects, surface modification, and electrostatic fields more efficiently compared with bulk architecture. In particular, patterning design, such as moir&#233; superlattice patterns and spatially periodic dielectric structures, are demonstrated to possess the ability to precisely control the local atomic and electronic environment at large scale, thus providing extra degrees of freedom to realize tailored material properties and device functionality. Here,&#160;the scalable atomic&#8208;scale patterning in superionic cuprous telluride by using the bonding difference at nonequivalent copper sites is reported. Moreover, benefitting from the natural coupling of ordered and disordered sublattices,&#160;controllable piezoelectricity&#8208;like multilevel switching and bipolar switching with the designed crystal structure and electrical contact is realized, and their application in image enhancement is demonstrated. This work extends the known classes of patternable crystals and atomic switching devices, and ushers in a frontier for image processing with memristors.

         <title>Can We See SEI Directly by&#160;Naked Eyes?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film can be seen directly by&#160;naked eyes based on its intrinsic fluorescence signal, obtained by fluorescent tracers acting as SEI film&#8208;forming additives for electrolytes. This shining SEI allows direct observation and quantification of the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI and reveals SEI formation growth destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles, enriching the knowledge and understanding of SEI.








Abstract
Stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, there are still many puzzles about SEI film that have not been well explained, due to the complexity of electrochemical reactions involving in SEI formation and the absence of direct observation methods for SEI. Here, this work realizes the direct observation of SEI by skillfully designed fluorescent tracers acting as an SEI film&#8208;forming additive for electrolytes. These fluorescent tracers have three important moieties: an olefin group for polymerization on anode surface so as to participate in SEI film formation during charge/discharge cycles, a polar group for Li&#8208;ion conduction, and an AIEgen for fluorescent tracing. Therefore, the tracers participate in SEI film&#8208;forming and result in a shining SEI film. This shining SEI film with intrinsic fluorescence signal allows direct observation and quantification on the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI. These fluorescent tracers can also reveal the SEI formation growth destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles. Several summarized typical macro morphologies and evolution stages of SEI will enrich knowledge and understanding of SEI and help to gain insight into the interaction between electrolyte and anode, electrochemical performance, and cycle life of batteries.

         <dc:description>
The challenge with aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) lies in the&#160;design of suitable cathode materials. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional topological Bi2Se3 with acceptable cation vacancies for ZIBs cathode is constructed through one&#8208;step hydrothermal process, which exhibits both enhanced ion and electron transport capability. The remarkable reversible charge storage capacity points to its promising strategy for achieving high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The challenge with aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) lies in finding suitable cathode materials that can provide high capacity and fast kinetics. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional topological Bi2Se3 with acceptable Bi&#8208;vacancies for ZIBs cathode (Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3) is constructed through one&#8208;step hydrothermal process accompanied by Cu heteroatom introduction. The cation&#8208;deficient Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 nanosheets (&#8776;4&#160;nm) bring improved conductivity from large surface topological metal states contribution and enhanced bulk conductivity. Besides, the increased adsorption energy and reduced Zn2+ migration barrier demonstrated by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the decreased Coulombic ion&#8208;lattice repulsion of Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3. Therefore, Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 exhibits both enhanced ion and electron transport capability, leading to more carrier reversible insertion proved by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). These features endow Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 with sufficient specific capacity (320&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate performance (97&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and reliable cycling stability (70&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles). Furthermore, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped ZIBs employing the Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8722;xSe3 cathode demonstrate respectable performance and superior flexibility even under high mass loading. This work implements a conceptually innovative strategy represented by cation defect design in topological insulator cathode for achieving high&#8208;performance battery electrochemistry.

         <title>Mesostructured Materials with Controllable Long&#8208;Range Orientational Ordering and Anisotropic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High and controllable degrees of macroscopic orientational ordering are demonstrated for mesostructured silica, titania, and carbon films. Judicious selection of synthesis conditions enables the control of the directions and relative rates of solvent removal, surfactant self&#8208;assembly, inorganic&#8208;oxide cross&#8208;linking, and the surfaces at which mesophases grow. The materials exhibit anisotropic properties for applications in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic mesophase materials provide a wide range of tunable properties, which are often highly dependent on their nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, or meso&#8208;scale compositions and structures. Among these are macroscopic orientational order and corresponding anisotropic material properties, the adjustability of which are difficult to achieve. This is due to the complicated transient and coupled transport, chemical reaction, and surface processes that occur during material syntheses. By understanding such processes, general criteria are established and used to prepare diverse mesostructured materials with highly aligned channels with uniform nanometer dimensions and controllable directionalities over macroscopic dimensions and thicknesses. This is achieved by using a micropatterned semipermeable poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp to manage the rates, directions, and surfaces at which self&#8208;assembling phases nucleate and the directions that they grow. This enables mesostructured surfactant&#8208;directed silica and titania composites, including with functional guest species, and mesoporous carbons to be prepared with high degrees of hexagonal order, as well as controllable orthogonal macroscopic orientational order.

     alt="Mesostructured Materials with Controllable Long-Range Orientational Ordering and Anisotropic Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High and controllable degrees of macroscopic orientational ordering are demonstrated for mesostructured silica, titania, and carbon films. Judicious selection of synthesis conditions enables the control of the directions and relative rates of solvent removal, surfactant self-assembly, inorganic-oxide cross-linking, and the surfaces at which mesophases grow. The materials exhibit anisotropic properties for applications in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic&#8211;organic mesophase materials provide a wide range of tunable properties, which are often highly dependent on their nano-, micro-, or meso-scale compositions and structures. Among these are macroscopic orientational order and corresponding anisotropic material properties, the adjustability of which are difficult to achieve. This is due to the complicated transient and coupled transport, chemical reaction, and surface processes that occur during material syntheses. By understanding such processes, general criteria are established and used to prepare diverse mesostructured materials with highly aligned channels with uniform nanometer dimensions and controllable directionalities over macroscopic dimensions and thicknesses. This is achieved by using a micropatterned semipermeable poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp to manage the rates, directions, and surfaces at which self-assembling phases nucleate and the directions that they grow. This enables mesostructured surfactant-directed silica and titania composites, including with functional guest species, and mesoporous carbons to be prepared with high degrees of hexagonal order, as well as controllable orthogonal macroscopic orientational order. The resulting materials exhibit novel anisotropic properties, as demonstrated by the example of direction-dependent photocurrent generation, and are promising for enhancing the functionality of inorganic&#8211;organic nanocomposite materials in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals (PGM), especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, we report the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Herein, we introduce an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrated that the Au&#8208;coating layer was induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, we verified that the suppression of dendrite growth was responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1,000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

Abstract
The immune response in cancer reflects a series of carefully regulated events; however, current tumor immunotherapies typically address a single key aspect to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In the present study, we developed a nanoplatform (Fe3O4@IR820@CpG)&#8208;based immunotherapy strategy that targets the multiple key steps in cancer&#8208;immunity cycle: 1) promotes the release of tumor&#8208;derived proteins (TDPs), including tumor&#8208;associated antigens and pro&#8208;immunostimulatory factors), in addition to the direct killing effect, by photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT); 2) captures the released TDPs and delivers them, together with CpG (a Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 [TLR&#8208;9] agonist) to antigen presenting cells (APCs) to promote antigen presentation and T cell activation; 3) enhances the tumor&#8208;killing ability of T cells by combining with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), which collectively advances our outstanding of the anti&#8208;tumor effects on colorectal, liver and breast cancers. The broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;tumor activity of Fe3O4@IR820@CpG with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 demonstrated that optimally manipulating anti&#8208;cancer immunity not singly but as a group provides promising clinical strategies.

         <title>Healthcare Monitoring Sensors Based on Organic Transistors: Surface/interface Strategy And Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic transistors possess inherent advantages such as flexibility, biocompatibility, customizable chemical structures, solution&#8208;processability, and amplifying capabilities, making them highly promising for portable healthcare sensor applications. Through convenient and diverse modifications at the material and device surfaces or interfaces, organic transistors allow for a wide range of sensor applications spanning from chemical and biological to physical sensing. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the surface and interface engineering aspect associated with four types of typical healthcare sensors. We systematically analyze and highlight the device operation principles, sensing mechanisms, and particularly focus on surface/interface functionalization strategies that contribute to the enhancement of sensing performance. An outlook and perspective on the critical issues and challenges in the field of healthcare sensing using organic transistors are provided as well.

         <title>Glass Microneedles: A Case Study for Regulatory Approval Using a Quality by Design Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this paper, we provide a roadmap for the regulatory approval of one of the exciting and dynamic drug&#160;delivery fields,&#160;microneedles,&#160;by using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach to pharmaceutical product development. In this regard, a quality target product profile (QTPP) and the critical quality attributes (CQA) of microneedles are identified. We discuss a case study of our recently patented method of fabricating glass microneedles&#160;entirely from a therapeutic agent, thus eliminating the requirement for additional excipients. The glass microneedle, ArrayPatch,&#160;is a propriety wearable device with platform potential consisting of an array of sharp, but painless, dissolvable microneedles manufactured with 100% drug. The microneedles penetrate the skin on application and dissolve to deliver a locally effective dose. The&#160;in&#8208;vitro&#160;characterisation of the microneedle CQAs under WHO&#8208;guided stability conditions will be described to assess the manufacturing readiness of ArrayPatch.&#160;&#160;A live technical video, is also provided, presenting a unique procedure of jugular vein cannulation through the ear vein of a pig animal model to study the&#160;in&#8208;vivo&#160;pharmacokinetics of ArrayPatch compared to standard of care marketed products.

Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging plays an increasingly crucial role in clinical radiography, industrial inspection and military applications. However, current X&#8208;ray imaging technologies have difficulty in protecting against information leakage caused by brute force attacks via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. Here we report high&#8208;confidentiality X&#8208;ray imaging encryption by fabricating ultralong radioluminescence memory films composed of lanthanide&#8208;activated nanoscintillators (NaLuF4: Gd3+ or Ce3+) with imperceptible purely&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) emission. Mechanistic investigations unveil that ultralong X&#8208;ray memory is attributed to the long&#8208;lived trapping of thermalized charge carriers within Frenkel defect states and subsequent slow release in the form of imperceptible radioluminescence. The encrypted X&#8208;ray imaging can be securely stored in the memory film for more than 7 days and optically decoded by a layer of perovskite nanocrystal film. Importantly, our encryption strategy can protect X&#8208;ray imaging information against brute force trial&#8208;and&#8208;error attacks through the perception of lifetime change in the persistent radioluminescence. We further demonstrate that the as&#8208;fabricated flexible memory film enables to achieving of three&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray imaging encryption of curved objects with a high spatial resolution of 20 lp/mm and excellent recyclability. This study provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;UV conversion in nanocrystal lattices and opens up a new avenue toward the development of high&#8208;confidentiality, three&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray imaging encryption technologies.

         <title>Embedded Host/Guest Alloy Aggregations Enable High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate molecular aggregations are critical to ternary organic solar cells. In this work, a versatile embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregation in the ternary matrix is reported and the primary driving forces to regulate guest distributions are outlined. With optimized molecular packing and exciton/charge properties, exceptional fill factors over 81% are realized from Y6&#8208;free ternary devices, and 19.2% efficiencies are recorded based on Y6&#8208;family acceptors.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been intensively studied to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Thereinto, the location of the guest component plays a critical role, but few reports have been devoted to this concern. Hereon, the distribution of LA1 as a guest acceptor in a variety of ternary scenarios is reported and the dominating driving forces of managing the guest distribution and operating modes are outlined. Governed by the appropriate relationship of compatibility, crystallinity, and surface energies between host and guest acceptors, as well as interfacial interactions between donor and dual acceptors, most of the LA1 molecules permeate into the internal of host acceptor phases, forming embedded host/guest alloy&#8208;like aggregations. The characteristic distributions greatly optimize the morphologies, maximize energy transfer, and enhance exciton/charge behaviors. Particularly, PM6:IT&#8208;4F:LA1 ternary cells afford high efficiency of 15.27% with impressive fill factors (FF) over 81%. The popularization studies further verify the superiority of the LA1&#8208;involved alloy structures, and with the Y6&#8208;family acceptor as the host component, an outstanding efficiency of 19.17% is received. The results highlight the importance of guest distribution in ternary systems and shed light on the governing factors of distributing the guests in ternary cells.

         <title>Organic Bilayer Heterostructures with Built&#8208;In Exciton Conversion for 2D Photonic Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial growth process, a stepwise seeded growth strategy for precise synthesis of organic bilayer heterostructures with tailored heterojunction surface areas is demonstrated. Furthermore, the relative position and length ratio of component microwires can be finely modulated by controlling the crystallization time of seeded crystals. Notably, these prepared organic heterostructures can be applied in two&#8208;dimensional photonic encryption.








Abstract
Organic multilayer heterostructures with accurate spatial organization demonstrate strong light&#8208;matter interaction from excitonic responses and efficient carrier transfer across heterojunction interfaces, which are considered as promising candidates toward advanced optoelectronics. However, the precise regulation of the heterojunction surface area for finely adjusting exciton conversion and energy transfer is still formidable. Herein, organic bilayer heterostructures (OBHs) with controlled face&#8208;to&#8208;face heterojunction via a stepwise seeded growth strategy, which is favorable for efficient exciton propagation and conversion of optical interconnects are designed and synthesized. Notably, the relative position and overlap length ratio of component microwires (LDSA/LBPEA = 0.39&#8211;1.15) in OBHs are accurately regulated by modulating the crystallization time of seeded crystals, resulting into a tailored heterojunction surface area (R = Loverlap/LBPEA = 37.6%&#8211;65.3%). These as&#8208;prepared OBHs present the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide behaviors for optical outcoupling characteristics with tunable emission colors and intensities, which are applied into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) photonic barcodes. This strategy opens a versatile avenue to purposely design OBHs with tailored heterojunctions for efficient energy transfer and exciton conversion, facilitating the application possibilities of advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Central Core Substitutions and Film&#8208;Formation Process Optimization Enable Approaching 19% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel polymer acceptors based on quinoxaline units are synthesized. Central core substitutions are modified and achieve systemic adjustment of aggregation ability and interaction with polymer donor PM6, leading to different film&#8208;formation processes. As a result, PM6:PQx3&#8208;based devices deliver high power conversion efficiencies (18.06%, one of the highest values for binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells), excellent film&#8208;thickness tolerance, and superior stability.








Abstract
Molecular interactions and film&#8208;formation processes greatly impact the blend film morphology and device performances of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Molecular structure, such as the central cores of polymer acceptors, would significantly influence this process. Herein, the central core substitutions of polymer acceptors are adjusted and three quinoxaline (Qx)&#8208;fused&#8208;core&#8208;based materials, PQx1, PQx2, and PQx3 are synthesized. The molecular aggregation ability and intermolecular interaction are systematically regulated, which subsequently influence the film&#8208;formation process and determine the resulting blend film morphology. As a result, PQx3, with favorable aggregation ability and moderate interaction with polymer donor PM6, achieves efficient all&#8208;PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60%, which could be further improved to 18.06% after carefully optimizing device annealing and interface layer. This impressive PCE is one of the highest values for binary all&#8208;PSCs based on the classical polymer donor PM6. PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o is also involved in promoting light utilization, and the resulting ternary device shows an impressive PCE of 18.82%. In addition, PM6:PQx3&#8208;based devices exhibit high film&#8208;thickness tolerance, superior stability, and considerable potential for large&#8208;scale devices (16.23% in 1 cm2 device). These results highlight the importance of structure optimization of polymer acceptors and film&#8208;formation process control for obtaining efficient and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance AEM based on a new cationic group, N&#8208;methylquinuclidinium, is prepared, which shows ultrahigh alkaline stability and dimensional stability in highly concentrated alkaline solution and at high temperature. A prototype water electrolyzer by sandwiching this AEM between two nickel&#8208;alloy electrodes exhibits superior current density (1.94&#160;A&#160;m&#8722;2) at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;m KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. However, the bottleneck of its development is the poor comprehensive performance of AEM, especially the stability at highly concentrated alkaline condition and temperature. Herein, a new cationic group N&#8208;methylquinuclidinium with enhanced alkaline stability is proposed and hereby a full&#8208;carbon chain poly(aryl quinuclidinium) AEM is prepared. Compared with reported AEMs, it shows ultrahigh comprehensive alkaline stability (no chemical decomposition, no decay of conductivity) in 10&#160;m NaOH aqueous solution at 80&#160;&#176;C for more than 1800&#160;h, excellent dimensional stability (swelling ratio: &lt;10% in pure water, &lt;2% in 10&#160;m NaOH) in OH&#8722; form at 80&#160;&#176;C, high OH&#8722; conductivity (&#8776;139.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#160;&#176;C), and high mechanical properties (tensile strength: 41.5&#160;MPa, elongation at break: 50%). The water electrolyzer using the AEM exhibits a high current density (1.94&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V) when assembled with nickel&#8208;alloy foam electrodes, and high durability when assembled with nickel foam electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anion-exchange-membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. However, the bottleneck of its development is the poor comprehensive performance of AEM, especially the stability at highly concentrated alkaline condition and temperature. Herein, a new cationic group &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylquinuclidinium with enhanced alkaline stability is proposed and hereby a full-carbon chain poly(aryl quinuclidinium) AEM is prepared. Compared with reported AEMs, it shows ultrahigh comprehensive alkaline stability (no chemical decomposition, no decay of conductivity) in 10&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaOH aqueous solution at 80&#160;&#176;C for more than 1800&#160;h, excellent dimensional stability (swelling ratio: &amp;lt;10% in pure water, &amp;lt;2% in 10&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaOH) in OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; form at 80&#160;&#176;C, high OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity (&#8776;139.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#160;&#176;C), and high mechanical properties (tensile strength: 41.5&#160;MPa, elongation at break: 50%). The water electrolyzer using the AEM exhibits a high current density (1.94&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0&#160;V) when assembled with nickel-alloy foam electrodes, and high durability when assembled with nickel foam electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Hierarchical Microdevices Enable Pre&#8208;Programmed Controlled Release for Postsurgical and Unresectable Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfabrication concept, termed &#8220;Hierarchical Multiple Polymers Immobilization&#8221; (HMPI), is proposed to fabricate surface&#8208;erodible hierarchical microdevices, which enable any desired controlled release profile in situ in tumor beds according to clinical medication schedules. Specifically, hierarchical microdevices are tailored to implement multiple courses of single&#8208;drug and multi&#8208;drug controlled release and demonstrate promising alternative options for postsurgical and unresectable tumor control.








Abstract
Drug treatment is required for both resectable and unresectable cancers to strive for any meaningful improvement in&#160;patient outcomes. However, the clinical benefit of receiving conventional systemic administrations is often less than satisfactory. Drug delivery systems are preferable substitutes but still fail to meet diverse clinical demands due to the difficulty in programming drug release profiles. Herein, a microfabrication concept, termed &#8220;Hierarchical Multiple Polymers Immobilization&#8221; (HMPI), is introduced and biodegradable&#8208;polymer&#8208;based hierarchical microdevices (HMDs) that can pre&#8208;program any desired controlled release profiles are engineered. Based on the first&#8208;line medication of pancreatic and breast cancer, controlled release of single gemcitabine and the doxorubicin/paclitaxel combination in situ for multiple courses is implemented, respectively. Preclinical models of postsurgical pancreatic, postsurgical breast, and unresectable breast cancer are established, and the designed HMDs are demonstrated as well&#8208;tolerable and effective treatments for inhibiting tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis. The proposed HMPI strategy allows the creation of tailorable and high&#8208;resolution hierarchical microstructures for pre&#8208;programming controlled release according to clinical medication schedules, which may provide promising alternative treatments for postsurgical and unresectable tumor control.

         <title>Elucidation of Protonation Cooperativity of a STING&#8208;Activating Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physicochemical investigation of a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer, PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PC7A, reveals a protonation cooperativity driven by nanophase transition. This pH&#8208;triggered cooperative system of PC7A highlights a binary proton distribution between disassembled cationic unimers and self&#8208;assembled neutral micelles. The implementation of molecular cooperativity of self&#8208;assembled nanosystems inspires an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing design principle to achieve spatiotemporal precision.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials have the potential to improve the performance and overcome existing barriers of conventional nanotherapeutics. Molecular cooperativity design in stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine can amplify physiological signals, enabling a cooperative response for improved diagnostic and therapeutic precision. Previously, this work reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer, PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PC7A, that possesses innate immune activating properties by binding to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through polyvalent phase condensation. This interaction enhances STING activation and synergizes with the endogenous STING ligand for robust cancer immunotherapy. Despite its successes in innate immune activation, the fundamental physicochemical and pH&#8208;responsive properties of PC7A require further investigation. Here, this study elucidates the protonation cooperativity driven by the phase transition of PC7A copolymer. The highly cooperative system displays an &#8220;all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing&#8221; proton distribution between highly charged unimer (all) and neutral micelle (nothing) states without gradually protonated intermediates. The binary protonation behavior is further illustrated in pH&#8208;precision&#8208;controlled release of a representative anticancer drug, &#946;&#8208;lapachone, by PC7A micelles over a noncooperative PE5A polymer. Furthermore, the bimodal distribution of protons is represented by a high Hill coefficient (nH&#160;&gt;&#160;9), featuring strong positive cooperativity. This study highlights the nanoscale pH cooperativity of an immune activating polymer, providing insights into the physicochemical characterization and design parameters for future nanotherapeutics development.

         <title>Precipitated Iodine Cathode Enabled by Trifluoromethanesulfonate Oxidation for Cathode/Electrolyte Mutualistic Aqueous Zn&#8722;I Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;I batteries hold great potential for high&#8208;safety and sustainable energy storage. However, the iodide shuttling effect and the hydrogen evolution reaction that occur in the aqueous electrolyte remain the main obstacles for their further development. Herein, we present the design of a cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8722;I battery based on the inherent oxidation ability of aqueous trifluoromethanesulfonate ((OTf)&#8722;) electrolyte towards triiodide species. This results in the formation of iodine sediment particles assembled by fine iodine nanocrystals (approximately 10 nm). An iodine host cathode with high areal iodine loading was realized via a spontaneous absorption process that enriched redox&#8208;active iodine and iodide species from aqueous electrolyte onto nanoporous carbon based current collector. By tuning iodide redox process and suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, the assembled CEMA Zn&#8722;I batteries demonstrated a remarkable capacity retention of 76.9% over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, they exhibited a notable rate capability, with a capacity retention of 74.6% when the current density was increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the oxidation effect to repel redox&#8208;active species from the electrolyte to the cathode, paving a new avenue for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8722;I batteries.

         <title>Transferrin Receptor&#8208;Targeted Nonspherical Microbubbles for Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier Sonopermeation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microbubbles (MB) are widely used for ultrasound (US) imaging and drug delivery. MB are typically spherically shaped, due to surface tension. When heated above their glass transition temperature, polymer&#8208;based MB can be mechanically stretched to obtain an anisotropic shape, endowing them with unique features for US&#8208;mediated blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) permeation. We here show that nonspherical MB can be surface&#8208;modified with BBB&#8208;specific targeting ligands, thereby promoting binding to and sonopermeation of blood vessels in the brain. Actively targeted rod&#8208;shaped MB are generated via one&#8208;dimensional stretching of spherical poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) MB and via subsequently functionalizing their shell with anti&#8208;transferrin receptor (TfR) antibodies. Using US and optical imaging, we demonstrate that nonspherical anti&#8208;TfR&#8208;MB bind more efficiently to BBB endothelium than spherical anti&#8208;TfR&#8208;MB, both in vitro and in vivo. BBB&#8208;associated anisotropic MB produced stronger cavitation signals and markedly enhanced BBB permeation and delivery of a model drug as compared to spherical BBB&#8208;targeted MB. These findings exemplify the potential of antibody&#8208;modified nonspherical MB for targeted and triggered drug delivery to the brain.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries Operating at &#8208;60&#176;C Enabled By Co&#8208;Intercalation Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Battery performance at subzero is restricted by sluggish interfacial kinetics. To resolve this issue, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs) based on the polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode with anion storage chemistry and the hydrogen titanate (HTO) anode with K+/solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism are constructed. Both the PTPAn cathode and the HTO anode do not undergo the desolvation process, which can effectively accelerate the interfacial kinetics at subzero. As revealed by theoretical calculations and experimental analysis, the strong K+/solvent binding energy in the dilute electrolyte, the charge shielding effect of the crystal water, and the uniform SEI layer with high content of the flexible organic species synergically promote HTO to undergo K+/solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior. The special co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and anion storage chemistry enable HTO||PTPAn K&#8208;DIBs with superior rate performance and cycle durability, maintaining a capacity retention of 94.1% after 6000 cycles at &#8208;40&#176;C and 91% after 1000 cycles at &#8208;60&#176;C. These results provide a step forward for achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage devices at low temperatures.

To resolve this issue, potassium-based dual-ion batteries (K-DIBs) based on the polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode with anion storage chemistry and the hydrogen titanate (HTO) anode with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/solvent co-intercalation mechanism are constructed. Both the PTPAn cathode and the HTO anode do not undergo the desolvation process, which can effectively accelerate the interfacial kinetics at subzero. As revealed by theoretical calculations and experimental analysis, the strong K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/solvent binding energy in the dilute electrolyte, the charge shielding effect of the crystal water, and the uniform SEI layer with high content of the flexible organic species synergically promote HTO to undergo K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/solvent co-intercalation behavior. The special co-intercalation mechanism and anion storage chemistry enable HTO||PTPAn K-DIBs with superior rate performance and cycle durability, maintaining a capacity retention of 94.1% after 6000 cycles at -40&#176;C and 91% after 1000 cycles at -60&#176;C. These results provide a step forward for achieving high-performance energy storage devices at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Activating Tumor&#8208;Selective Liquid Metal Nanomedicine through Galvanic Replacement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced chemotherapeutic strategies including prodrug and nanocatalytic medicine have significantly advanced tumor&#8208;selective theranostics, but delicate prodrug screening, tedious synthesis, low degradability/biocompatibility of inorganic components and unsatisfied reaction activity complicate treatment efficacies. Here we explore intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplet (LMND) through the galvanic replacement. By utilizing a mechano&#8208;degradable ligand, the resultant size of aqueous LMND is unexpectedly controlled as small as &#8764;20&#160;nm (LMND20). We demonstrate that LMND20 presents excellent tumor penetration and biocompatibility and activates tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, synchronously depleting Cu2+ ions and producing Ga3+ ions through the galvanic replacement. Together with abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, multiple anticancer pathways lead to selective apoptosis and anti&#8208;angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Compared to the preclinical/clinical anticancer drugs of tetrathiomolybdate and Ga(NO3)3, LMND20 administration significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy and survival in a BCap&#8208;37 xenograft mouse model, yet without obvious side effects.

         <title>Physiological Barriers and Strategies of Lipid&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Nucleic Acid Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are currently the most promising delivery vehicles of nucleic acid drugs. However, their delivery efficiency and safety are largely compromised by a cascade of physiological barriers. In this review, the five different levels of physiological barriers for LBNP&#8208;based nucleic acids delivery and the current coping strategies are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are currently the most promising vehicles for nucleic acid drug (NAD) delivery. Although their clinical applications have achieved success, the NAD delivery efficiency and safety are still unsatisfactory, which are, to a large extent, due to the existence of multi&#8208;level physiological barriers in vivo. It is important to elucidate the interactions between these barriers and LBNPs, which will guide more rational design of efficient NAD vehicles with low adverse effects and facilitate broader applications of nucleic acid therapeutics. This review describes the obstacles and challenges of biological barriers to NAD delivery at systemic, organ, sub&#8208;organ, cellular, and subcellular levels. The strategies to overcome these barriers are comprehensively reviewed, mainly including physically/chemically engineering LBNPs and directly modifying physiological barriers by auxiliary treatments. Then the potentials and challenges for successful translation of these preclinical studies into the clinic are discussed. In the end, a forward look at the strategies on manipulating protein corona (PC) is addressed, which may pull off the trick of overcoming those physiological barriers and significantly improve the efficacy and safety of LBNP&#8208;based NADs delivery.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Spatiotemporal Measurement of Extracellular Signaling Molecules Using An Aptamer Switch&#8208;Conjugated Hydrogel Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cells rely on secreted signaling molecules to coordinate essential biological functions including development, metabolism, and immunity. Unfortunately, such signaling processes remain difficult to measure with sufficient chemical specificity and temporal resolution. To address this need, we have developed an aptamer&#8208;conjugated hydrogel matrix that enables continuous fluorescent measurement of specific secreted analytes &#8211; in two dimensions, in real&#8208;time. As a proof of concept, we performed real&#8208;time imaging of Dictyostelium discoideum cells, a well&#8208;studied amoeba model wherein inter&#8208;cellular communication is performed though cAMP signaling. We engineered a set of aptamer switches that generate a rapid and reversible change in fluorescence in response to cAMP signals. By combining multiple switches with different dynamic ranges, we can measure cAMP concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude in a single experiment. These sensors are embedded within a biocompatible hydrogel on which cells are cultured and their cAMP secretions can be imaged using fluorescent microscopy. Using this aptamer&#8208;hydrogel material system, we achieved the first direct measurements of oscillatory cAMP signaling that correlate closely with previous indirect measurements. Using different aptamer switches, this approach could be generalized for measuring other secreted molecules to directly visualize diverse extracellular signaling processes and the biological effects that they trigger in recipient cells.

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally&#8208;friendly semiconductor for stable and high efficiency thin film solar cells, but, like many other polycrystalline materials, is limited by non&#8208;radiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries. Herein, we show how the grain boundary density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#177;40&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 (largest grain &#8764;5&#160;&#181;m) to 327&#177;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 (largest grain &gt;15&#160;&#181;m) by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of the structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, we reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased grain size and improved photovoltaic performance of Sb2S3 solar cells. A critical factor behind the reduction in grain boundary density is the formation of an ultrathin layer of Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which could reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as increase the rate of grain growth. Through a reduction in non&#8208;radiative recombination at grain boundaries and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, we achieved high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%, and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV. This VOC is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films via in&#8208;situ chemical environment tuning, which can be more broadly applied to other thin film systems to improve their photovoltaic performance.

Through a reduction in non-radiative recombination at grain boundaries and/or the CdS/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterointerface as well as improved charge-carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, we achieved high performance Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%, and an open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 796&#160;mV. This &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; is the highest reported thus far for Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; absorber films via in-situ chemical environment tuning, which can be more broadly applied to other thin film systems to improve their photovoltaic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling The Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions, which hinder the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with a textured crystal facets using a novel 2&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side&#8208;reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8211;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogels for in Situ Programming of Car&#8208;T Cells Towards Solid Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell immunotherapy has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfaction in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self&#8208;assembly between cationic polymer mPEG&#8208;PCL&#8208;PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti&#8208;CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD), has been designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieved in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR&#8208;T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (IL&#8208;2, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IFN&#8208;&#947;) or tumor killer protein granzyme B was significantly promoted, which reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhanced the intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer report of using injectable supramolecular hydrogel for in situ reprogramming CAR&#8208;T cells, which might be beneficial for solid tumor CAR&#8208;T immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfaction in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra-tumor CAR-T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self-assembly between cationic polymer mPEG-PCL-PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti-CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and &#945;-cyclodextrin (&#945;-CD), has been designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieved in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR-T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TNF-&#945;, and IFN-&#947;) or tumor killer protein granzyme B was significantly promoted, which reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhanced the intra-tumor CAR-T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscopic 3D Tumor Models with a Self&#8208;Organizing Vascularized Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting and bioengineering approaches are combined to cultivate 3D vascularized tumors, including patient&#8208;derived ones, at the mesoscopic scale. Functional connections between self&#8208;evolved vascular networks and bioprinted endothelium enable the spontaneous migration of cancer cells from tumor spheroids to the fluid flow. This work opens new avenues for exploring the metastatic cascade in vitro at physiologically relevant spatial and temporal scales.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro systems such as multicellular spheroids and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been developed, but often fall short in reproducing the tissue scale and self&#8208;organization of human diseases. A bioprinted artificial tumor model is introduced with endothelial and stromal cells self&#8208;organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. This model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. It is shown that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of cocultivated tumor spheroids. The self&#8208;developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self&#8208;assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient&#8208;derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in the bioreactors. Overall, this modular approach opens up new avenues for studying tumor pathophysiology and cellular interactions in vitro, providing a platform for advanced drug testing while reducing the need for in vivo experimentation.

         <title>Universal Polarization Transformations: Spatial Programming of Polarization Scattering Matrices Using a Deep Learning&#8208;Designed Diffractive Polarization Transformer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal polarization transformer based on a structured diffractive volume optimized using deep learning can synthesize a large set of arbitrarily&#8208;selected, complex&#8208;valued polarization scattering matrices between its input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view. This universal polarization transformation framework is experimentally validated in the terahertz spectrum by fabricating wire&#8208;grid polarizers and integrating them with 3D&#8208;printed diffractive layers to form a physical polarization transformer.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of optical fields having nonuniform polarization distributions presents a challenging task. Here, a universal polarization transformer is demonstrated that can synthesize a large set of arbitrarily&#8208;selected, complex&#8208;valued polarization scattering matrices between the polarization states at different positions within its input and output field&#8208;of&#8208;views (FOVs). This framework comprises 2D arrays of linear polarizers positioned between isotropic diffractive layers, each containing tens of thousands of diffractive features with optimizable transmission coefficients. After its deep learning&#8208;based training, this diffractive polarization transformer can successfully implement NiNo = 10 000 different spatially&#8208;encoded polarization scattering matrices with negligible error, where Ni and No represent the number of pixels in the input and output FOVs, respectively. This universal polarization transformation framework is experimentally validated in the terahertz spectrum by fabricating wire&#8208;grid polarizers and integrating them with 3D&#8208;printed diffractive layers to form a physical polarization transformer. Through this set&#8208;up, an all&#8208;optical polarization permutation operation of spatially&#8208;varying polarization fields is demonstrated, and&#160;distinct spatially&#8208;encoded polarization scattering matrices are simultaneously implemented between the input and output FOVs of a compact diffractive processor. This framework opens up new avenues for developing novel devices for universal polarization control and may find applications in, e.g., remote sensing, medical imaging, security, material inspection, and machine vision.

         <title>High Entropy Oxides Modulate Atomic&#8208;Level Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are introduced as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) to address the electrostatic repulsion between Zn2+ and conventional oxides. Benefiting from the extended &#603;d band and robust structures, the optimized HEOs achieve outstanding rate capabilities (136.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term stability (115.3 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles) in AZIBs.








Abstract
The strong electrostatic interaction between high&#8208;charge&#8208;density zinc ions (112 C mm&#8722;3) and the fixed crystallinity of traditional oxide cathodes with delayed charge compensation hinders the development of high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs).

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy oxides (HEOs) are introduced as cathodes in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) to address the electrostatic repulsion between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and conventional oxides. Benefiting from the extended &lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Aqueous&#8208;Based Inorganic Colloidal Halide Perovskites Customizing Liquid Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of perovskite&#8208;mediated aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with the commercial scintillator AbLS is fabricated. PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their bright emission (photoluminescence quantum yield &gt; 90%), robust stability (100 days), robust radiation hardness (82.8 Gy), and conceptual potential applied in radiation detection from every angle of 360&#176;.








Abstract
Compared to solid scintillators and organic liquid scintillators, aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (AbLS) have more superiority in highly flexible scalability, yet are now limited by their low light yield (&#8776;100 photons MeV&#8722;1). Here, aqueous&#8208;based inorganic colloidal halide perovskites with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of three primary color luminescence up to 88.1% (red), 96% (green), and 81.8% (blue) are respectively synthesized, and a new generation of colloidal perovskite&#8208;mediated AbLS (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with the commercial scintillator AbLS is fabricated. This paper exhibits that the excellent PLQY and colloidal dispersion of halide perovskites benefit from poly(ethylene glycol) modification and this modification ensures the vacancy inhibition and formation of defect&#8211;free surfaces in an aqueous solution. Moreover, their high luminescent emission can be maintained for 100 days at low temperatures, and such modification also promises the heat&#8208;to&#8208;cold customization of operating temperature even in ice below 0 &#176;C. Finally, depending on the light yield of around 3058 and 8037 photons MeV&#8722;1 at room temperature and low temperature, PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their robust radiation hardness (dose rate as high as 23 mGy s&#8722;1) and conceptual application potential in high&#8208;energy ray radiation detection from every angle of 360&#176;.

         <title>Inkjet Printing of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inkjet printing (IJP) is an additive manufacturing process that selectively deposits ink materials, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, to create three&#8208;dimensional (3D) objects or two&#8208;dimensional (2D) patterns with precise control over their structure and composition. This technology has emerged as an attractive and versatile approach to address the ever&#8208;evolving demands of personalized medicine in the healthcare industry. Although originally developed for non&#8208;healthcare applications, IJP harnesses the potential of pharma&#8208;inks, which are meticulously formulated inks containing drugs and pharmaceutical excipients. Delving into the formulation and components of pharma&#8208;inks, the key to precise and adaptable material deposition enabled by IJP is unraveled. The review extends its focus to substrate materials, including paper, films, foams, lenses, and 3D&#8208;printed materials, showcasing their diverse advantages, whilst exploring a wide spectrum of therapeutic applications. Additionally, the potential benefits of hardware and software improvements, along with artificial intelligence integration, are discussed to enhance IJP's precision and efficiency. Embracing these advancements, IJP holds immense potential to reshape traditional medicine manufacturing processes, ushering in the era of medical precision. However, further exploration and optimization are needed to fully utilize IJP's healthcare capabilities. As researchers push the boundaries of IJP, the vision of patient&#8208;specific treatment is on the horizon of becoming a tangible reality.

         <title>Full&#8208;color Generation Via Photo&#8208;tunable Mono Ink for Fast and Elaborate Printings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unlike pigment&#8208;based colors, which are determined by their molecular structure, diverse colors can be expressed by a regular arrangement of nanomaterials. However, existing techniques for constructing such nanostructures have struggled to combine high precision and speed, resulting in a narrow gamut, and prolonged color fabrication time. Here, we report a photo&#8208;tunable mono ink that can generate a wide range of colors by controlling regularly arranged nanostructure. Core&#8208;shell growth controlled by polymerization time precisely regulates the distance between arranged particles at a nanometer&#8208;scale, enabling the generation of various colors. Moreover, the wide and thin arrangement induces constrained out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth, thus facilitating the intricate color generation at the desired location via photo&#8208;polymerization. Upon terminating polymerization by oxygen gas, the generated colors are readily fixed and kept stable. Utilizing programmed ultraviolet illumination, large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution (&#8764;1 &#956;m) full&#8208;color printings are demonstrated at high speed (100 mm2/s).

         <title>Highly&#8208;adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, And Assembling Across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, we designed highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONT) capable of manipulating single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm. Additionally, we introduced a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. We believe that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network with Pd Nanoparticle Nodes Synergizes Oxidase&#8208;Like And Photothermal Properties to Eradicate Oral Polymicrobial Biofilm&#8208;Associated Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing an effective treatment strategy to combat oral diseases caused by complex polymicrobial biofilms remains a great challenge. Herein, we construct a series of metal&#8208;phenolic network with Pd nanoparticle nodes (MPN&#8208;Pd) using polyphenols as stabilizers and reducing agents. Among them, sulfonated lignin&#8208;Pd (SLS&#8208;Pd) with ultrafine size palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and broadband near infrared absorption exhibited excellent oxidase&#8208;like activity and stable photothermal effect. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the superoxide radical generated by SLS&#8208;Pd oxidase&#8208;like activity exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect induced hyperthermia exhibits potent antifungal properties. This difference is further elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis and all&#8208;atom simulation. Moreover, the SLS&#8208;Pd&#8208;mediated synergistic antimicrobial system exhibits remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms. By establishing a root canal model and an oropharyngeal candidiasis model, the feasibility of the synergistic antimicrobial system in treating oral biofilm&#8208;related infections is further validated. This system provides a promising therapeutic approach for polymicrobial biofilm&#8208;associated infections in the oral cavity.

Among them, sulfonated lignin-Pd (SLS-Pd) with ultrafine size palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and broadband near infrared absorption exhibited excellent oxidase-like activity and stable photothermal effect. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the superoxide radical generated by SLS-Pd oxidase-like activity exhibits selective antibacterial effects, while its photothermal effect induced hyperthermia exhibits potent antifungal properties. This difference is further elucidated by RNA-sequencing analysis and all-atom simulation. Moreover, the SLS-Pd-mediated synergistic antimicrobial system exhibits remarkable efficacy in combating various biofilms and polymicrobial biofilms. By establishing a root canal model and an oropharyngeal candidiasis model, the feasibility of the synergistic antimicrobial system in treating oral biofilm-related infections is further validated. This system provides a promising therapeutic approach for polymicrobial biofilm-associated infections in the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Plasmonic Hybrid Nanostructures: A Gateway to Advanced Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chirality introduces a new dimension of functionality to materials, unlocking new possibilities across various fields. When integrated with plasmonic hybrid nanostructures, this attribute synergizes with plasmonic and other functionalities, resulting in unprecedented chiroptical materials that push the boundaries of the system's capabilities. Recent advancements have illuminated the remarkable chiral light&#8208;matter interactions within chiral plasmonic hybrid nanomaterials, allowing for the harnessing of their tunable optical activity and hybrid components. These advancements have led to applications in areas such as chiral sensing, catalysis, and spin optics. Despite these promising developments, there remains a need for a comprehensive synthesis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, as well as a thorough understanding of the construction techniques and practical applications in this field. In this review, we begin with an exploration of the origins of plasmonic chirality and an overview of the latest advancements in the synthesis of chiral plasmonic hybrid nanostructures. Furthermore, we classify and summarize representative emerging categories of hybrid nanomaterials, elucidating their versatile applications. Finally, we engage with the fundamental challenges associated with chiral plasmonic hybrid nanostructures and offer insights into the future prospects of this advanced field.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Multienzymatic Cascades and Nanomaterial Scaffolding &#8208;A Potential Way Forward for The Efficient Biosynthesis of Novel Chemical Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Synthetic biology is touted as the next industrial revolution as it promises access to greener biocatalytic syntheses to replace many industrial organic chemistries. Here, we look to what synthetic biology can offer in the form of multienzyme cascades for the synthesis of the most basic of new materials &#8211; chemicals, including especially designer chemical products and their analogs. Since achieving this is predicated on dramatically expanding the chemical space that enzymes access, such chemistry will probably be undertaken in cell&#8208;free or minimalist formats to overcome the inherent toxicity of non&#8208;natural substrates to living cells. We begin by laying out relevant aspects that need to be considered in the design of multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades for these purposes. We critically review representative multienzymatic cascades, which have been specifically developed for the synthesis of compounds that have either been made only by traditional organic synthesis along with those cascades utilized for novel compound syntheses. Lastly, we provide an overview of strategies that look towards exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale materials phenomena in vitro to direct novel enzymatic biosynthesis and improve catalytic efficiency. We end with a perspective on what is needed for this field to develop in the short and long term.

         <title>Assessing Early Atherosclerosis by Detecting and Imaging of Hypochlorous Acid and Phosphorylation Using Fluorescence Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The assessment of early atherosclerosis (AS) is of great significance for the early diagnosis and mechanism research. Herein, a novel nanoprobe PCN@FL was developed to realize the simultaneous detection and imaging of phosphorylation and hypochlorous acid (HClO). The selective recognition of HClO was achieved through the specific interaction between DMTC and HClO, while the levels of phosphorylation were detected via the specific interaction between Zr (IV) and phosphates. The nanoprobe can be utilized to monitor the fluctuations in HClO and phosphate in early atherosclerosis. It is observed that the levels of HClO and phosphate in the serum of early AS mice are higher those of the normal mice. Ultimately, the levels of hypochlorous acid and phosphorylation in the inner wall of aortic vessels are imaged by two&#8208;photon microscope. The results showed that the levels of HClO and phosphorylation in the early atherosclerotic mice are significantly higher than those of in normal mice. The nanoprobe provides a suitable fluorescent tool for simultaneous detection and imaging of HClO and phosphorylation, which holds promise for early atherosclerotic disease assessment.

         <title>All&#8208;inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, we report a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine). The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way towards their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <title>Dislodgement of Hydrogen Bubbles in Microchannels with Embedded Pillars: An Analytical, Experimental, and Numerical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microchannels with integrated pillars have enhanced the production capabilities and performance of various applications due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. However, emerging gas bubbles can become trapped, potentially limiting the functionality or efficiency of the device when scaled down to the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Understanding the conditions required to dislodge these bubbles is thus critical for optimizing microfluidic devices with complex physical behaviors. This study presents an analytical model that outlines the dislodgment conditions and driving forces for such gas&#8211;liquid flows. These terms are derived from the gas&#8211;liquid interface properties, geometry, and processing parameters. As the density of the pillar arrangement is scaled down, the resistance to bubble dislodgment typically increases. Nevertheless, the bubble is compelled to dislodge at lower pressure loads when critical volumes are reached. This newly discovered effect is particularly noticeable in densely packed arrays and can be explained by the interplay of increased surface tension, geometrical restrictions, and volume&#8208;preserving forces. The analytical terms and effects are validated through novel experimental and numerical methods tailored for microchannels in the low&#8208;micrometer scale, showing strong agreement.

         <title>The Synthescope: A Vision for Combining Synthesis with Atomic Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts toward atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fabrication have gathered momentum. Recent results with electron&#8208;beam manipulation illustrate a significant advance toward atomic&#8208;scale patterning. In this work, the case is made that future efforts in this direction will benefit from reconceptualizing the scanning transmission electron microscope as a combined synthesis and manipulation platform, and simple strategies to incorporate synthesis processes with existing hardware are provided.








Abstract
The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic&#8208;scale material&#8208;manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic&#8208;scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic&#8208;scale structure and chemistry of a few &#8220;active sites&#8221; can have a dramatic impact on larger&#8208;scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic&#8208;scale processes can help point the way to larger&#8208;scale synthesis approaches.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II&#160;Fluorophore with Inverted Dependence of Fluorescence Quantum Yield on Polarity as Potent Phototheranostics for Fluorescence&#8208;Image&#8208;Guided Phototherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorophore AS1 with inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity is used to construct potent phototheranostics (AS1R) for clear delineation and complete elimination of tumors by phototherapy with an ultralow injection dose. Compared with other types of organic phototheranostics, AS1R exhibits better phototheranostic performance in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration.








Abstract
Organic phototheranostics simultaneously having fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) window, and photothermal and photodynamic functions possess great prospects in tumor diagnosis and therapy. However, such phototheranostics generally suffer from low brightness and poor photodynamic performance due to severe solvatochromism. Herein, an organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore AS1, which possesses an inverted dependence of fluorescence quantum yield on polarity, is reported to serve as potent phototheranostics for tumor diagnosis and therapy. After encapsulation of AS1 into nanostructures, the obtained phototheranostics (AS1R) exhibit high extinction coefficients (e.g., 68200&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm), NIR&#8208;II emission with high fluorescence quantum yield up to 4.7% beyond 1000 nm, photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8776;65%, and 1O2 quantum yield up to 4.1%. The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that AS1R is superior to other types of organic phototheranostics in brightness, photothermal effect, and photodynamic performance at the same mass concentration. The excellent phototheranostic performance of AS1R enables clear visualization and complete elimination of tumors using a single and low injection dose. This study demonstrates the merits and prospects of NIR&#8208;II fluorophore with inverted polarity dependence of fluorescence quantum yield as high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents for fluorescence imaging and phototherapy of tumors.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adaptive Polymers Trigger Fission of Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) for enhanced delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The hydrophobicity of polymers at the tumor acidic microenvironment drives the fission of MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and cancer stem cells.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) can function as anticancer drug&#8208;delivery carriers. However, short blood circulation time, large&#8208;size&#8208;induced insufficient tumor accumulation and penetration into tumor parenchyma, as well as limited cellular internalization by tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and difficult intracellular drug release restrict the anticancer activity of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MP&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems. In this work, hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) are anchored to tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs for enhanced delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The polymers are hydrophilic in blood to prolong the circulation time of DOX&#8208;loaded MPs (DOX@MPs), while rapidly switching to hydrophobic at the tumor acidic microenvironment. The hydrophobicity of polymers drives the fission of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration, and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and CSCs. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. The work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived MPs.

         <title>Ultrastrong Ionotronic Films Showing Electrochemical Osmotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastrong nanocomposite is introduced, which is formed based on the two nanoscopic building blocks: large&#8208;size 2D MXene and 1D nanocellulose with very high aspect ratio. In the wet state, the hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite provide high ionotronic conductivity and enable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane actuation with reversible giant strain reaching 85% at only 1 V.








Abstract
A multifunctional soft material with high ionic and electrical conductivity, combined with high mechanical properties and the ability to change shape can enable bioinspired responsive devices and systems. The incorporation of all these characteristics in a single material is very challenging, as the improvement of one property tends to reduce other properties. Here, a nanocomposite film based on charged, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 1D flexible nanocellulose fibrils, and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is presented. The self&#8208;assembly process results in a stratified structure with the nanoparticles aligned in&#8208;plane, providing high ionotronic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as large water uptake. In hydrogel form with 20&#160;wt% liquid, the electrical conductivity is over 200 S cm&#8722;1 and the in&#8208;plane tensile strength is close to 100&#160;MPa. This multifunctional performance results from the uniquely layered composite structure at nano&#8208; and mesoscales. A new type of electrical soft actuator is assembled where voltage as low as &#177;1&#160;V resulted in osmotic effects and giant reversible out&#8208;of&#8208;plane swelling, reaching 85% strain.

The ability to control the deposition of nanoscale layers of silk on semiconductors allows transistors that can controllably operate either in the ionic or dielectric regime to be built. These devices can be produced at scale and allow for a class of hybrid, (bio)functional devices where semiconductors and natural materials coexist, reducing the gap between biology and technology even further.








Abstract
In recent years, increased control over naturally derived structural protein formulations and their self&#8208;assembly has enabled the application of high&#8208;resolution manufacturing techniques to silk&#8208;based materials, leading to bioactive interfaces with unprecedented miniaturized formats and functionalities. Here, a hybrid biopolymer&#8211;semiconductor device, obtained by integrating nanoscale silk layers in a well&#8208;established class of inorganic field&#8208;effect transistors (silk&#8208;FETs), is presented. The devices offer two distinct modes of operation&#8212;either traditional field&#8208;effect or electrolyte&#8208;gated&#8212;enabled by the precisely controlled thickness, morphology, and biochemistry of the integrated silk layers. The different operational modes are selectively accessed by dynamically modulating the free&#8208;water content within the nanoscale protein layer from the vapor phase. The utility of these hybrid devices is illustrated in a highly sensitive and ultrafast breath sensor, highlighting the opportunities offered by the integration of nanoscale biomaterial interfaces in conjunction with traditional semiconductor devices, enabling functional outcomes at the intersection between the worlds of microelectronics and biology.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmed Stem Cell Niches via Orthogonal Extracellular Vesicle&#8211;Cell Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded ligand&#8211;receptor system (DLRS) is developed to program orthogonal interkingdom EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This system enables a DNA&#8208;programmed stem cell niche for stemness maintenance and self&#8208;renewal of female germline stem cells (FGSCs) without the need for living feeder cells.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural carriers for intercellular transfer of bioactive molecules, which are harnessed for wide biomedical applications. However, a facile yet general approach to engineering interspecies EV&#8211;cell communications is still lacking. Here, the use of DNA to encode the heterogeneous interfaces of EVs and cells in a manner free of covalent or genetic modifications is reported, which enables orthogonal EV&#8211;cell interkingdom interactions in complex environments. Cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands and tetrahedral DNA frameworks are employed with complementary sequences to serve as artificial ligands and receptors docking on EVs and living cells, respectively, which can mediate specific yet efficient cellular internalization of EVs via Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. It is shown that based on this system, human cells can adopt EVs derived from the mouse, watermelon, and Escherichia coli. By implementing several EV&#8211;cell circuits, it shows that this DNA&#8208;programmed system allows orthogonal EV&#8211;cell communications in complex environments. This study further demonstrates efficient delivery of EVs with bioactive contents derived from feeder cells toward monkey female germline stem cells (FGSCs), which enables self&#8208;renewal and stemness maintenance of the FGSCs without feeder cells. This system may provide a universal platform to customize intercellular exchanges of materials and signals across species and kingdoms.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of PZT Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record&#8208;high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy&#8208;storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional EDBS of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2), resulting in a record high energy&#8208;storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Scissoring Perfluoroarenes Trigger Photomultiplication in Full Color Organic Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks consisting of photo&#8208;crosslinked polymer donor:perfluoroarene exhibit exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, leading to high EQE photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes together with enhanced stability and fine photo&#8208;patternability, without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. This mechanism is enabled by interfacial energy band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor, as confirmed by photophysical analyses.








Abstract
An unprecedented but useful functionality of perfluoroarenes to enable exciton scissoring in photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (PM&#8208;OPDs) is reported. Perfluoroarenes that are covalently connected to polymer donors via a photochemical reaction enable the demonstration of high external quantum efficiency and B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPDs without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. The operation mechanism of the suggested perfluoroarene&#8208;driven PM&#8208;OPDs, how covalently bonded polymer donor:perfluoroarene PM&#8208;OPDs can perform as effectively as polymer donor:fullerene blend&#8208;based PM&#8208;OPDs, is investigated. By employing a series of arenes and conducting steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy analyses, it is found that interfacial band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor is responsible for exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, which induces photomultiplication. Owing to the acceptor&#8208;free and covalently interconnected photoactive layer in the suggested PM&#8208;OPDs, superior operational and thermal stabilities are observed. Finally, finely patterned B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPD arrays that enable the construction of highly sensitive passive matrix&#8208;type organic image sensors are demonstrated.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

The 3D-printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi-responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D-printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D-printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3-DoF motion into an extrusion-based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo-heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi-actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability and Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.








Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa vs dry) and a work density of &#8776;150&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3 (2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;vs dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

         <title>A Spidroin&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical&#8208;Structure Binder Achieves Highly Integrated Silicon&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution&#8208;based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating huge volume change of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is reported. The AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life.








Abstract
As a promising component for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, silicon&#8208;based electrodes have attracted increasing attention by virtue of their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, fast capacity fading posed by tremendous silicon&#8208;based electrode volume changes during cycling remains a huge challenge before large&#8208;scale applications. In this work, an aqueous&#8211;oil binary solution based blend (AOB) binder characterized by a spidroin&#8208;like hierarchical structure for tolerating the huge volume changes of silicon&#8208;based electrodes is developed. In the AOB binder, the polymer, containing hydrophobic tetrazole groups, denoted as PPB, and the water&#8208;soluble amorphous poly(acrylic acid), mimick the &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix structure of spidroin, respectively. Benefitting from such biomimetic design, the AOB binder enables both high tensile strength and elasticity, and strong electrode adhesion, therefore apparently stabilizing the silicon&#8208;based electrode structure and rendering prolonged electrode cycle life. Such a strategy endows 3.3 Ah soft package cells assembled with Si/C composite anode and NCM811 cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 2.92 Ah after 700 cycles. This work marks a milestone in developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicon&#8208;based electrodes toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;battery applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Intelligent Wearable Devices Using Logical Circuits of Monolithic Gold Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. The monolithically patterned gold nanowires enable robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The multifunctional intelligent wearable devices can sensitively monitor strain and temperature changes with the heating system for various biomedical applications.








Abstract
Although multifunctional wearable devices have been widely investigated for healthcare systems, augmented/virtual realities, and telemedicines, there are few reports on multiple signal monitoring and logical signal processing by using one single nanomaterial without additional algorithms or rigid application&#8208;specific integrated circuit chips. Here, multifunctional intelligent wearable devices are developed using monolithically patterned gold nanowires for both signal monitoring and processing. Gold bulk&#160;and hollow nanowires&#160;show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on&#8208;demand heating systems, and strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro&#8208;wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain&#8208;gated logical circuits. Taken together, this multifunctional intelligent wearable device would be harnessed as a promising platform for futuristic electronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Additive&#8208;Assisted Tellurium Homogenization in ZnSeTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence on aqueous hydrohalic acids poses challenges when working with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors, as seen in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe quantum dots. In this work, a safe and oxygen&#8208;free method is proposed to introduce anhydrous acids into the synthesis using benzenecarbonyl fluoride as a chemical additive. This method enables a controlled release of acid, resulting in a more uniform Te distribution within the ZnSeTe lattice.








Abstract
Addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids during the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is widely employed to achieve high&#8208;quality QDs. However, this reliance on the use of aqueous solutions is incompatible with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors such as those used in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe QDs. Herein, it is shown that this incompatibility leads to phase segregation into Te&#8208;rich and Te&#8208;poor regions, causing spectral broadening and luminescence peak shifting under high laser irradiation and applied electrical bias. Here, a synthetic strategy to produce anhydrous&#8208;HF in situ by using benzenecarbonyl fluoride (BF) as a chemical additive is reported. Through in situ 19F NMR spectroscopy, it is found that BF reacts with surfactants in tandem, ultimately producing intermediary F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;trioctylamine adducts. These act as a pseudo&#8208;HF source that releases anhydrous HF. The controlled release of HF during nucleation and growth steps homogenizes Te distribution in ZnSeTe lattice, leading to spectrally stable blue&#8208;emitting QDs under increasing laser flux from &#8776;3 &#181;W to &#8776;12 mW and applied bias from 2.6 to 10 V. Single&#8208;dot photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and analyses of the absorption, PL and transient absorption spectra together with density functional theory point to the role of anhydrous HF as a Te homogenizer.

         <title>Oriented Perovskite Film from Laser Recrystallization in Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>

&#8220;MAPLA&#8221; employs magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing to control perovskite crystal orientation on substrates, enhancing crystal size, orientation, and stability. Magnetic nanoparticles guide orientational gathering into nanoclusters. Device performance improves with responsivity and detectivity increasing two times, and photocurrent three orders higher than pulsed laser annealing. MAPLA enhances stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction, making MAPLA promising for stable electro&#8208;optical thin films.








Abstract
The orientation of crystals on the substrate and the presence of defects are critical factors in electro&#8208;optic performance. However, technical approaches to guide the orientational crystallization of electro&#8208;optical thin films remain challenging. Here,&#160;a novel physical method called magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted pulse laser annealing (MAPLA) for controlling the orientation of perovskite crystals on substrates is reported. By inducing laser recrystallization of perovskite crystals under a magnetic field and with magnetic nanoparticles, the optical and magnetic fields are found to guide the orientational gathering of perovskite units into nanoclusters, resulting in perovskite crystals with preferred lattice orientation in (110) and (220) perpendicular to the substrate. The perovskite crystals obtained by MAPLA exhibit significantly larger grain size and fewer defects compared to those from pulsed laser annealing (PLA) and traditional thermal annealing, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Furthermore, MAPLA demonstrates enhanced device performance, increasing responsivity and detectivity by two times, and photocurrent by nearly three orders compared with PLA. The introduction of Fe2O3 nanoparticles during MAPLA not only improves crystal size and orientation but also significantly enhances long&#8208;term stability by preventing Pb2+ reduction. The MAPLA method has great potential for fabricating many electro&#8208;optical thin films with desired device properties and stability.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Organic Radical Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous achievement of high efficiency (&gt;17%) and radiance (&gt;1.0 &#215; 105 mW sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is demonstrated based on doublet fluorescence with the combination of a bipolar host and a novel organic radical. Photophysical studies and device characterization support the substantial enhancement of device performance for doublet electroluminescence.








Abstract
Organic radicals have been of interest due to their potential to replace nonradical&#8208;based organic emitters, especially for deep&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electroluminescence (EL), based on the spin&#8208;allowed doublet fluorescence. However, the performance of the radical&#8208;based EL devices is limited by low carrier mobility which causes a large efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities. Here, highly efficient and bright doublet EL devices are reported by combining a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host that supports both electron and hole transport and a tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl&#8208;based radical emitter. Steady&#8208;state and transient photophysical studies reveal the optical signatures of doublet luminescence mechanisms arising from both host and guest photoexcitation. The host system presented here allows balanced hole and electron currents, and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.4% at 707&#160;nm peak emission with substantially improved efficiency roll&#8208;off is reported: over 70% of the maximum EQE (12.2%) is recorded at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and even at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, nearly 50% of the maximum EQE (8.4%) is maintained. This is an important step in the practical application of organic radicals to NIR light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Confining Prepared Ultrasmall Nanozymes Loading ATO for Lung Cancer Catalytic Therapy/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall nPt nanozymes are innovatively fabricated upon AuP via a SiO2 spatial confinement strategy, and then modified with human serum albumin, followed by loading&#160;atovaquone molecules, and encapsulating IR780 in succession, to design AP&#8208;HAI probes in which the IR780's PDT property and the nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes with a high reactive oxygen species (ROS) productivity, which results in outstanding lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
Nanozymes with inherent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic properties combat malignant tumor progression via catalytic therapy, while the therapeutic efficacy still needs to be improved. In this work, ultrasmall platinum nanozymes (nPt) in a confined domain of a wormlike pore channel in gold nanobipyramidal&#8211;mesoporous silica dioxide nanocomposites, producing nanozyme carriers AP&#8208;mSi with photoenhanced peroxidase ability, are innovatively synthesized. Afterward, based on the prepared AP&#8208;mSi, a lung&#8208;cancer nanozymes probe (AP&#8208;HAI) is ingeniously produced by removing the SiO2 template, modifying human serum albumin, and loading atovaquone molecules (ATO) as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborate for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic process of H2O2. Additionally, loaded ATO, a cell respiration inhibitor, can impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness. As a result, IR780's PDT and nPt nanozymes' photoenhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endow probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting antitumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies reveal that the obvious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enables lung&#8208;cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/immunogenic&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photoenhanced nanozyme probes.

         <title>Carrageenan as a Sacrificial Binder for 5&#160;V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#955;&#8208;Carrageenan (CRN) is introduced as a &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder to produce a desired LiSOxF&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase on 5 V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from its innate sulfate functionality. CRN also protects the cathode surface from indiscriminate side reactions by its uniform coverage involving hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction, thereby catching two challenging rabbits of stable cyclability and high&#8208;rate performance simultaneously.








Abstract
5&#160;V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) with its spinel symmetry is a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high&#8208;voltage operation of LNMO renders it vulnerable to interfacial degradation involving electrolyte decomposition, which hinders long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. Herein, this longstanding challenge presented by LNMO is overcome by incorporating a sacrificial binder, namely, &#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CRN), a sulfated polysaccharide. This binder not only uniformly covers the LNMO surface via hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interaction but also offers an ionically conductive cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer containing LiSOxF, a product of the electrochemical decomposition of the sulfate group. Taking advantage of these two auspicious properties, the CRN&#8208;based electrode exhibits cycling and rate performance far superior to that of its counterparts based on the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) and sodium alginate binders. This study introduces a new concept, namely &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; binder, for battery electrodes known to deliver superior electrochemical performance but be adversely affected by interfacial instability.

         <title>An In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembled Bispecific Nanoblocker for Enhancing Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>

A peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker strategy is developed for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells, which enables boosted T&#8208;cells infiltration by CXCR4 blockage and enhanced T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T&#8208;cells activation. However, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components induced by unsatisfactory T&#8208;cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies make it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, a peptide&#8208;based bispecific nanoblocker (BNB) strategy is reported for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that are capable of boosting T&#8208;cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the BNB strategy selectively recognizes and bonds CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self&#8208;assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, BNB exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, that is, the elimination half&#8208;life (t1/2) of BNB in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h which is &#8776;50 times longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcome potential systemic side effects. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T&#8208;cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, these findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Cation&#8211;&#960;&#160;Interactions Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Bright, and Spectrally Stable Rec. 2020 Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;size aromatic amino acid of tryptophan (TRP), featuring strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, is introduced to "clean" the imperfect surface sites of the CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). The as&#8208;formed TRP&#8208;NCs demonstrate increased luminescence efficiency and obviously enhanced spectral stability, which enables the achievement of Rec.2020 pure&#8208;red perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibiting high external quantum efficiency along with superior brightness and spectral stability.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with pure&#8208;red electroluminescence for practical applications remains a critical challenge because of the problematic luminescence property and spectral instability of existing emitters. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs, simultaneously exhibiting exceptional brightness and spectral stability, based on CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) capping with aromatic amino acid ligands featuring cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, are reported. It is proven that strong cation&#8211;&#960; interactions between the PbI6&#8208;octahedra of perovskite units and the electron&#8208;rich indole ring of tryptophan (TRP) molecules not only chemically polish the imperfect surface sites, but also markedly increase the binding affinity of the ligand molecules, leading to high photoluminescence quantum yields and greatly enhanced spectral stability of the CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Moreover, the incorporation of small&#8208;size aromatic TRP ligands ensures superior charge&#8208;transport properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at around 635&#160;nm demonstrate a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a max luminance of 12&#8239;910&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and outstanding spectral stability, representing one of the best&#8208;performing Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs achieved so far.

         <title>Boosting the Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n with continuously controllable surface compositions is synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of 5&#8208;hyfroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibits excellent performance inHMF electrooxidation, with a current density of 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and selectivity of &gt;98% for the 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by: 1) the low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) the low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures are synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; can be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in situ characterizations, contact angle analysis,&#160;and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibits excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Inspired Magnesium&#8211;Oxygen Biobattery with High Energy Density In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery with a double&#8208;membrane structure, inspired by the mitochondrion, is presented. The biobattery exhibits an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1 based on the overall volume of the device in vivo. It also shows excellent biocompatibility, with high device/tissue affinity.








Abstract
Implantable batteries are urgently needed as a power source to meet the demands of the next generation of biomedical electronic devices. However, existing implantable batteries suffer from unsatisfactory energy density, hindering the miniaturization of these devices. Here, a mitochondrion&#8208;inspired magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery that achieves both high energy density and biocompatibility in vivo is reported. The resulting biobattery exhibits a recorded energy density of 2517 Wh&#160;L&#8211;1/1491 Wh&#160;kg&#8211;1 based on the total volume/mass of the device in vivo, which is &#8776;2.5 times higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, and can adapt to different environments for stable discharges. The volume of the magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm3 and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance implantable batteries.

The volume of the magnesium&#8211;oxygen biobattery can be as thin as 0.015 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and can be scaled up to 400 times larger without reducing the energy density. Additionally, it shows a stable biobattery/tissue interface, significantly reducing foreign body reactions. This work presents an effective strategy for the development of high-performance implantable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of a Chemical Bath Deposition Based Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Transport Layer for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tin oxide electron&#8208;transport layer for perovskite solar cells is developed via chemical bath deposition. Oxalic acid, a volatile dicarboxylic acid ligand, functions as a chemical linker to facilitate film deposition and can be readily removed by thermal annealing and a mild H2O2 treatment. The result is an efficient (24.6%) and stable (T85 = 1500&#160;h) perovskite solar cell.








Abstract
Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is widely used to deposit tin oxide (SnOx) as an electron&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnOx particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA is reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, a volatile oxalic acid (OA) is introduced as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H2O2 treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H2O2 treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnOx layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy) confirms that the SnOx surface is dominated by Sn4+, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn2+ and Sn4+. This rational design of a CBD SnOx layer leads to devices with T85 &#8776;1500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA&#8208;based device with T80 &#8776;250&#160;h. The champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnOx to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Fruit&#8208;Derived Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Engineered Structural Droplet Drugs for Enhanced Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fruit&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) exhibit excellent stability and flexibility, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB) and deeply penetrate into glioblastoma tissues by deformation&#8208;amplified endocytosis and membrane fusion. As expected, the ESDDs present more efficient capacities than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs) in accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;glioblastoma efficacy.








Abstract
Existing solid&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems remain a great challenge for glioblastoma chemotherapy due to their poor capacities in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Herein, fruit&#8208;derived extracellular&#8208;vesicle (EV)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDDs) are demonstrated by programming the self&#8208;assembly of fruit&#8208;derived EVs at the DOX@squalene&#8211;PBS interface, greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy against glioblastoma. The ESDDs experience a flexible delivery via deformation&#8208;amplified macropinocytosis and membrane fusion, enabling them to highly efficiently cross the BBB/BBTB and deeply penetrate glioblastoma tissues. As expected, the ESDDs exhibit approximately 2.5&#8208;fold intracellular uptake, 2.2&#8208;fold transcytosis, and fivefold membrane fusion higher than cRGD&#8208;modified EVs (REs), allowing highly efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into the glioblastoma tissues, and thereby significantly extending the survival time of glioblastoma mice.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Generated Electron&#8208;Blocking LiH Enabling an Unprecedented Critical Current Density of Over 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for Solid&#8208;State Hydride Electrolytes</title>

         <dc:description>
A partial dehydrogenation strategy in situ generates an electronic blocking dispersed LiH layer on the particle surfaces of LiBH4&#8208;based electrolyte to realize excellent dendrite suppression capability, expended voltage window, and broadened operational temperature, which extend their applicability in highly safe and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high&#8208;energy density in power&#8208; or energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
LiBH4 is a promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) due to its thermodynamic stability to Li. However, poor Li&#8208;ion conductivities at room temperature, low oxidative stabilities, and severe dendrite growth hamper its application. In this work, a partial dehydrogenation strategy is adopted to in situ generate an electronic blocking layer dispersed of LiH, addressing the above three issues simultaneously. The electrically insulated LiH reduces the electronic conductivity by two orders of magnitude, leading to a 32.0&#8208;times higher critical electrical bias for dendrite growth on the particle surfaces than that of the counterpart. Additionally, this layer not only promotes the Li&#8208;ion conductance by stimulating coordinated rotations of BH4&#8722; and B12H122&#8722;, contributing to a Li&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.38 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also greatly enhances oxidation stability by localizing the electron density on BH4&#8722;, extending its voltage window to 6.0&#160;V. Consequently, this electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) of 15.12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25 &#176;C, long&#8208;term Li plating and stripping stability for 2700&#160;h, and a wide temperature window for dendrite inhibition from &#8722;30 to 150 &#176;C. Its Li&#8208;LiCoO2 cell displays high reversibility within 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V. It is believed that this work provides a clear direction for solid&#8208;state hydride electrolytes.

         <title>Scalable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photoanodes with &gt;100&#160;h Operational Stability Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge for the application of perovskite photoelectrodes for solar fuels and feedstock generation is to overcome their instability in aqueous media and the use of expensive materials. In this work, a CsPbBr3 photoanode is presented that contains solely earth&#8208;abundant materials and reaches over 100&#160;h operational stability, which can be easily extended to weeks.








Abstract
The application of halide perovskites in the photoelectrochemical generation of solar fuels and feedstocks is hindered by the instability of perovskites in aqueous electrolytes and the use of expensive electrode and catalyst materials, particularly in photoanodes driving kinetically slow water oxidation. Here, solely earth&#8208;abundant materials are incorporated to fabricate a CsPbBr3&#8208;based photoanode that reaches a low onset potential of +0.4 VRHE and 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 photocurrent density at +1.23 VRHE for water oxidation, close to the radiative efficiency limit of CsPbBr3. This photoanode retains 100% of its stabilized photocurrent density for more than 100&#160;h of operation by replacing once the inexpensive graphite sheet upon signs of deterioration. The improved performance is due to an efficiently electrodeposited NiFeOOH catalyst on a protective self&#8208;adhesive graphite sheet, and enhanced charge transfer achieved by phase engineering of CsPbBr3. Devices with &gt;1 cm2 area, and low&#8208;temperature processing demonstrate the potential for low capital cost, stable, and scalable perovskite photoanodes.

&lt;p&gt;A critical challenge for the application of perovskite photoelectrodes for solar fuels and feedstock generation is to overcome their instability in aqueous media and the use of expensive materials. In this work, a CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode is presented that contains solely earth-abundant materials and reaches over 100&#160;h operational stability, which can be easily extended to weeks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of halide perovskites in the photoelectrochemical generation of solar fuels and feedstocks is hindered by the instability of perovskites in aqueous electrolytes and the use of expensive electrode and catalyst materials, particularly in photoanodes driving kinetically slow water oxidation. Here, solely earth-abundant materials are incorporated to fabricate a CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based photoanode that reaches a low onset potential of +0.4 &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and 8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; photocurrent density at +1.23 &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; for water oxidation, close to the radiative efficiency limit of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This photoanode retains 100% of its stabilized photocurrent density for more than 100&#160;h of operation by replacing once the inexpensive graphite sheet upon signs of deterioration. The improved performance is due to an efficiently electrodeposited NiFeOOH catalyst on a protective self-adhesive graphite sheet, and enhanced charge transfer achieved by phase engineering of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Devices with &amp;gt;1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, and low-temperature processing demonstrate the potential for low capital cost, stable, and scalable perovskite photoanodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple&#8208;Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, and Anionic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical hollow core&#8211;shell FeMn@CoNi&#8211;Se PBA materials with metallic Ni NPs loading can be synthesized via low&#8208;temperature thermal treatment. The prepared PBA&#8208;Se 350 displays outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, superior to commercial catalysts.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high&#8208;performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core&#8211;shell PBAs are employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enables the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that results in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presents ultralow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low Tafel slope (43.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming leading&#8208;edge PBA&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity is revealed, assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process.&#160;The exsolved Ni NPs are found to help turn the PBAs into Se&#8208;doped core&#8211;shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation are combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway.

         <title>Ultrarapid&#8208;Acting Microneedles for Immediate Delivery of Biotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch to realize immediate delivery of biotherapeutics with negligible residuals in tissue is presented. In this design, accelerated drug release is achieved by incorporating effervescent agents into the needle tip. The rapid release, easy administration, and excellent biocompatibility of URA&#8208;MN are well demonstrated in three different mouse models.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) injection is a common administration route for rapid and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics. However, syringe&#8208;based injections usually require professional assistance and are associated with pain and potential risks of infections, thus leading to undesired patient compliance and poor life quality. Herein, this work presents an ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch for immediate transdermal delivery of therapeutics in a minimally invasive manner. Effervescent agents are incorporated into the tip of URA&#8208;MN for rapid generation of CO2 bubbles upon insertion into the skin, immediately powering the biotherapeutics release within a few minutes. The release kinetics of diverse agents including liraglutide (LRT), insulin, and heparin from the URA&#8208;MN patches are evaluated in three different mouse models, and the rapid release of biotherapeutics and potent therapeutic effects are achieved with only 5 min administration. Noteworthily, attributed to the short application duration and negligible residuals of MN matrix remaining in the skin, the URA&#8208;MN patch shows desirable biocompatibility after six&#8208;week administration.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Electron&#8208;Acceptor Single Crystals with Chiral 2D Supramolecular Organization for Anisotropic Chiral Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing chiral centers into the fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor BTP&#8208;4F yields an intriguing 2D supramolecular organization consisting of intertwined, oppositely helical molecules, in which the intermolecular chiral exciton coupling is responsible for the chirality at the supramolecular level. A significant current dissymmetry factor exceeding &#8722;1.4 is achieved, whose amplified, inverted, and anisotropic current dissymmetry is revealed by the finite element simulations.








Abstract
Supramolecular chiral organization gives &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules access to fascinating specific interactions with circularly polarized light (CPL). Such a feature enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance chiral organic electronic devices that detect or emit CPL directly. Herein, it is shown that chiral fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;acceptor BTP&#8208;4F single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based phototransistors demonstrate distinguished CPL discrimination capability with current dissymmetry factor exceeding 1.4, one of the highest values among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art direct CPL detectors. Theoretical calculations prove that the chirality at the supramolecular level in these enantiomeric single crystals originates from chiral exciton coupling of a unique quasi&#8208;2D&#160;supramolecular organization consisting of interlaced molecules with opposite helical conformation. Impressively, such supramolecular organization produces a higher dissymmetry factor along the preferred growth direction of the chiral single crystals in comparison to that of the short axis direction. Furthermore, the amplified, inverted, and also anisotropic current dissymmetry compared to optical dissymmetry is studied by finite element simulations. Therefore, a unique chiral supramolecular organization that is responsible for the excellent chiroptical response and anisotropic electronic properties is developed, which not only enables the construction of high&#8208;performance CPL detection devices but also allows a better understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in chiral organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of immunothrombosis is an unmet medical need as it relates to prevalent and life&#8208;threatening conditions, including severe COVID&#8208;19&#160;and sepsis. A novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive nanoprobe releases a volatile reporter molecule, when in contact with thrombin. The volatile reporter exits the circulation in the lungs. Analysis of the exhaled breath provides unprecedented quantitative knowledge of thrombin activity in vivo.








Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19&#160;and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, noninvasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air is introduced for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, is selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC is quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS), allowing near real&#8208;time assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS&#8208;based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreases with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin&#8208;sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe is developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing this unmet medical need. This novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques and Spin Hall Magnetoresistance Generated by Twin&#8208;Free and Amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1 Topological Insulator Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a topological insulator with promising applications in spintronics and highly debated charge&#8211;spin conversion properties. Measurements of magnetoresistance and current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit torques in Bi0.9Sb0.1/FeCo bilayers establish an isotropic charge&#8211;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in twin&#8208;free crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 and 0.1 in amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. Depending on temperature, thermally excited bulk carriers and the isotropic surface states contribute to the torques in crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1. &#160;








Abstract
Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices. Bi1&#8722;xSbx is a prominent topological insulator that has a high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and magnitude of the SOTs induced by current&#8208;injection in Bi1&#8722;xSbx remain controversial. Here, the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in twin&#8208;free epitaxial layers of Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) coupled to FeCo are investigated, and compared with those of amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. A large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than 0.1 in the second is found, confirming crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 as a strong spin&#8208;injector material. The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of the electric current, indicating that charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in single&#8208;crystal Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) is isotropic despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, it is found that the damping&#8208;like SOT has a non&#8208;monotonic temperature dependence with a minimum at 20&#160;K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak antilocalization measurements, charge&#8211;spin conversion is concluded to occur via thermally excited holes from the bulk states above 20&#160;K, and conduction through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to decreasing electron&#8211;electron scattering below&#160;20&#160;K.

         <title>Enabling Scalable Polymer Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Reinforced Stable Interface for 4.5&#160;V Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer electrolyte (F&amp;NPE) is developed to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces, which can effectively suppress interfacial parasitic reactions and structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy promising for continuous scalable fabrication is utilized. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve excellent long&#8208;term cyclability even with high cathode loading and thin Li.








Abstract
Hitherto, it remains a great challenge to stabilize electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfaces and impede lithium dendrite proliferation in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich LiNxCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) layer cathodes. Herein, a special molecular&#8208;level&#8208;designed polymer electrolyte is prepared by the copolymerization of hexafluorobutyl acrylate and methylene bisacrylamide to construct dual&#8208;reinforced stable interfaces. Verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, there are favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal anodes and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The SEI enriched in lithiophilic N&#8722;(C)3 guides the homogenous distribution of Li+ and facilitates the transport of Li+ through LiF and Li3N, promoting uniform Li+ plating and stripping. Moreover, the CEI with antioxidative amide groups can suppress the parasitic reactions between cathode and electrolyte and the structural degradation of cathode. Meanwhile, a unique two&#8208;stage rheology&#8208;tuning UV polymerization strategy is utilized, which is quite suited for continuous electrolyte fabrication with environmental friendliness. The fabricated polymer electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. 4.5&#160;V NCM622//Li batteries achieve prolonged operation with a retention rate of 85.0% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides new insights into molecular design and processibility design for polymer&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>MDM2&#8208;Targeting Reassembly Peptide (TRAP) Nanoparticles for p53&#8208;Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATO@MtrapNP construction, followed by MDM2&#8208;trap construction and mutated p53 rescuer delivering for oncotherapy is described. This strategy allows for efficient delivery of p53 mutation rescuers and thus suppresses the associated side effects. At the same time, the MDM2 trap can be constructed to efficiently inhibit MDM2 function, thereby protecting p53 from MDM2 inhibition.








Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Therefore, ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Thus, the MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

         <title>Computationally Guided Synthesis of MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of a dry, fluorine&#8208;free MXene synthesis route is investigated through quantum mechanics calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Computational insights are experimentally validated to demonstrate synthesis of MXenes through dry selective extraction (DSE) of MAX phase precursors using iodine vapor under suitable temperatures and pressures. The DSE approach opens avenues for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of new MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides and nitrides&#160;that&#160;are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based etchants are typically used for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes&#160;and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first&#8208;principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the &#8220;CALculation of PHAse Diagrams&#8221; (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine&#8208;free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.

&lt;p&gt;MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides and nitrides&#160;that&#160;are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric-acid-based etchants are typically used for large-scale and high-throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine-free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes&#160;and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first-principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the &#8220;CALculation of PHAse Diagrams&#8221; (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine-free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pulsed&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Tetragonal BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient pressure induced by a 355&#160;nm pulsed laser (PL) builds a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field on tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T), contributing to the photoinduced carrier separation and band bending of the BTO&#8208;T. The PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and efficient continuous photocatalysis (0.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The recombination of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysts is considered one of the biggest barriers to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysts open a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting the lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requiring external force (e.g., ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring, and ball milling). In this study, a low&#8208;power UV pulsed laser (PL) (3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as a UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T) in the absence of an applied force. The tremendous transient light pressure (5.7 &#215; 107&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO&#8208;T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induces a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes the highest reported performance, reaching a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Metal Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: From Photoactivation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photocorrosion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of plasmonic supercrystals made of Ag@Pt nanoparticles is monitored through operando nanobubble imaging by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy. The degradation mechanisms following light irradiation are investigated at the single supercrystal and nanoparticle level by correlative microscopy and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8211;electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively.








Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. Here, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals are then used as a plasmonic photocatalytic platform for triggering the hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy, which allows gas nanobubble nucleation to be probed at the early stage with high temporal resolution and the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them to be quantified. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy help to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H&#8208;TaS2 demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.








Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non&#8208;magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s&#8208;wave state. Furthermore, many&#8208;body excitations emerge close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. The results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.

         <title>Non&#8208;Lignin Constructing the Gas&#8211;Solid Interface for Enhancing the Photothermal Catalytic Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool (K&#8208;STO/TiN SW) is used to build photothermal&#8211;photocatalytic system. TiN SW enables stable steam production and produced a gas/solid reaction interface with a lower Gibbs free energy. This enables K&#8208;STO to split water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and ensures that the TiN SW substrate material does not involve in the catalytic reaction.








Abstract
The progress of solar&#8208;driven water&#8208;splitting technology has been impeded by the limited light response capability of semiconductor materials. Despite attempts to leverage nearly 50% of infrared radiation for photothermal synergy and catalytic reaction enhancement, heat loss during liquid phase reactions results in low energy conversion efficiency. Here, the photothermally driven catalytic water&#8208;splitting system, which designs K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool at the water&#8211;air interface. Photocatalytic tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the thermal effect transforms liquid water into water vapor, thereby reducing the reaction free energy of catalysts and improving the transmission rate of catalytic products. Hence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 275.46&#160;mmol m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 1.81% under 1 sun irradiation in this gas&#8211;solid system, which is more than twice that of liquid water splitting. This novel photothermal catalytic pathway, which involves a coupled reaction of water evaporation and water splitting, is anticipated to broaden the utilization range of the solar spectrum and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of STH.

         <title>Anion Confinement for Homogeneous Mixed Halide Perovskite Film Growth by Electrospray</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray deposition shows great advance to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components by spatially confining the anion diffusion, which universally improves the homogeneity of perovskite films. As a result, the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs are significantly promoted.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are promising absorbers for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandem solar cells to feasibly surpass Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit with low cost. However, the commonly used mixed halide perovskites suffer from poor stability; particularly, photoinduced phase segregation. Electrospray deposition is developed to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components during film growth by spatially confining the anion diffusion and eliminating the kinetic difference, which universally improves the initial homogeneity of perovskite films regardless of device architectures. It thus promotes the efficiency and stability of corresponding solar cells based on wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#160;eV) absorbers. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.44% and 20.77% are achieved in 0.08 cm2 and 1.0 cm2 devices, respectively. In addition, these devices maintain 90% of their initial PCE after 1550&#160;h of stabilized power output (SPO) tracking upon one sun irradiation (LED) at room temperature.

         <title>An AND Logic Gate for Magnetic&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Ferroptosis Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO) with the function of an AND logic gate are designed and constructed for enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsiveness, whose advantages include the conversion of negative T2 signal to positive T1 signal under the dual action of ROS and GSH in the TME and high&#8208;performance ferroptosis therapy of tumors.








Abstract
To improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficiency and ferroptosis therapy efficacy of exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO, &lt;5&#160;nm) for tumors via enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, inspired by molecular logic gates, a self&#8208;assembled IO with an AND logic gate function is designed and constructed. Typically, cystamine (CA) is conjugated onto the end of poly(2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA&#8208;CA. The PMEMA&#8208;CA is grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)&#8208;loaded IO to form IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA. The self&#8208;assembled IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA (SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA) is obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon&#8211;sulfur single bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to a thio&#8211;oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in the TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+, and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;Colonized Bacteria and Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fusobacterium&#160;nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is presented, by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes&#160;to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum. In F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous colorectal tumor models and a chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer model, such F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine can effectively relieve F. nucleatum&#8208;derived pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Clinical evidence indicates that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, it is found that, owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum and d&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum can colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors can lead to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is designed by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As a result, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies can be successfully restored, as demonstrated in an F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models, and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, this work presents an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimicking nanomedicine that can selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, which is promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

         <title>Phosphorescent&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes with TFB:10 wt% Ir(MDQ)2(acac) as hole&#8208;transport layer and exciton harvester realize a record high external quantum efficiency of 37% (37.3 cd A&#8722;1, 41 lm W&#8722;1) and a central wavelength of 628 nm with narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23.4 nm. The devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.








Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by the quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8211;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here, an exciton sensitizing approach is reported, where excitons form on a phosphorescent&#8208;dye&#8208;doped layer, which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy&#8208;transfer processes, higher device performance can be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye, iridium (III) bis(2&#8208;methyldibenzo&#8208;[f,h]quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac), doped hole&#8208;transporting layer are fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41&#160;lm W&#8722;1, and 37%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic is greatly improved, in that 35% EQE can be well retained at a high luminance level of 450&#8201;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>A Smart Single&#8208;Fluorophore Polymer: Self&#8208;Assembly Shapechromic Multicolor Fluorescence and Erasable Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart single&#8208;fluorophore polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers: amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites, exhibits deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. Besides, PGP driven by its reversible chelation capacity can be used as an advanced fluorescent ink with erasable and recoverable properties.








Abstract
A novel smart fluorescent polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) is developed by incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers at molecular level. The triggers are amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites. PGP exhibits smart deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8211;shell micelles of cyan&#8208;green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep&#8208;blue fluorescence. A quasi&#8208;reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and the resulting intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu2+ and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Asymmetric Directional Control of Thermal Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional control of thermal emission is key to efficient radiative heat transport. However, achieving angular&#8208;asymmetric directionality remains challenging in reciprocal systems due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, asymmetric directional thermal emission is demonstrated using symmetry&#8208;broken metagratings. The design principle holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on thermal&#8208;engineering applications.








Abstract
Control over the directionality of thermal emission plays a fundamental role in efficient heat transport. Although nanophotonic technologies have demonstrated the capability for angular&#8208;selective thermal emission, achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems with energy directed to a single output angle remains challenging due to symmetric band dispersion. In this work, a general strategy for achieving asymmetric directional thermal emission in reciprocal systems is presented. With periodic perturbation and broken mirror symmetry, metasurfaces behave as resonant metagratings whose resonances can be diffracted to symmetric output angles with distinct efficiency, allowing for high emissivity toward a single direction. An asymmetric directional thermal emitter is experimentally demonstrated at mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths with high emissivity (&#603;&#160;=&#160;0.61) at the observation angle of +30&#176;, and low emissivity (&#603; &lt; 0.3) at other angles. This work highlights the potential for manipulating the directionality of thermal emission, which holds promise for developing ultrathin customized thermal sources and impacts on various thermal&#8208;engineering applications.

Immunothrombosis
Thrombin's enzymatic activity in the living organism was for the first time measured in the exhaled breath. Novel nanoprobes released a gaseous reporter in potentially fatal microthrombi. This technology aims to improve precision of care in serious conditions including sepsis, COVID&#8208;19, diabetes complications, and lung fibrosis. More details can be found in article number 2304903 by Ali Hafezi&#8208;Moghadam and co&#8208;workers. Nanoprobes and fibrin strands in a microvessel were digitally painted by Dr. Alexander Schering.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Synthesis
In article number 2301560 by Ondrej Dyck, Andrew R. Lupini, and Stephen Jesse, a vision for a revolution in STEM capabilities is presented. The vision is a &#8220;synthescope&#8221; &#8208; an instrument that can image, characterize, synthesize, and manipulate materials at the atomic scale through advanced microscopy techniques. The critical insight is the delivery of atomized material to the sample for a combined top&#8208;down (fabrication) and bottom&#8208;up (synthesis) approach to atomic&#8208;scale materials engineering.

The nano&#8208;grain architecture composite microstructure of crystalline and amorphous phase with the same composition, achieved through mechanical tailoring, exhibits artificial relaxor ferroelectric behavior, which dramatically expands the material design space.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water&#8208;stable perovskite photocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP&#8208;based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated. This is then followed by presenting several different material design strategies for stability enhancement, including reaction medium modification, material surface protection, structural dimensionality engineering, and chemical composition engineering. Emphases are placed on understanding the effects of these strategies on photocatalytic stability as well as the possible structure&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the possible future research directions for pursuing stable and efficient MHP photocatalysts in order to accelerate their technological maturity on a practical scale are outlined. With that, it is hoped to provide readers a valuable snapshot of this rapidly developing and exciting field.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;Generation Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on using liquid crystals (LCs) to improve driving performance and add special functions to smart RF devices. Since the design of the RF device itself imposes limits on maximization of performance, it must be considered in the materials domain. The fundamental understanding of LCs for advanced reconfigurable telecommunication devices and key research directions are discussed, suggesting design strategies for LCs in advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and functionality.








Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective focuses on using liquid crystals (LCs) to improve driving performance and add special functions to smart RF devices. Since the design of the RF device itself imposes limits on maximization of performance, it must be considered in the materials domain. The fundamental understanding of LCs for advanced reconfigurable telecommunication devices and key research directions are discussed, suggesting design strategies for LCs in advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and functionality.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well-established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high-frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio-frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next-generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer-modified LCs, dual-frequency LCs, and photo-reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state-of-the-art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 45, November 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials, from property prediction and geometry generation to inverse design. It is highly anticipated that deep learning can bring about significant advancements in mechanical metamaterials by creating universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence in the near&#160;future.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>MICROFLUIDIC&#8208;assisted 3d Printing Zinc Powder Anode with 2d Conductive MOF/MXene Heterostructures for High&#8208;stable Zinc&#8208;organic Battery</title>

Abstract
Zinc powder (Zn&#8208;P) anodes have significant advantages in terms of universality and machinability compared with Zn foil anodes. However, their rough surface, which has a high surface area, intensifies the uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions. In this study, an anti&#8208;corrosive Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode with a functional layer formed from a MXene and Cu&#8208;THBQ (MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ) heterostructure was successfully fabricated via microfluidic&#8208;assisted 3D printing. The unusual anti&#8208;corrosive and strong adsorption of Zn ions using the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ functional layer can effectively homogenise the Zn ion flux and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during the repeated process of Zn plating/stripping, thus achieving stable Zn cycling. Consequently, a symmetric cell based on Zn&#8208;P with the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ anode exhibited a highly reversible cycling of 1,800 h at 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a Zn&#8208;organic full battery matched with a 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl organic cathode riveted on graphene delivered a high reversible capacity and maintained a long cycle life.

         <title>Ni Single&#8208;Atoms Based Memristors with Ultrafast Speed and Ultralong Data Retention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memristor with low&#8208;power, high density and scalability fulfills the requirements of the applications of the new computing system beyond Moore's law. However, there are still nonideal device characteristics observed in the memristor to be solved. The important observation is that retention and speed are correlated parameters of memristor with trade off against each other. The delicately modulating distribution and trapping level of defects in electron migration based memristor is expected to provide compromise method to address the contradictory issue of improving both switching speed and retention capability. Here, we report high performance memristor based on structure of ITO/Ni single&#8208;atoms (NiSAs/N&#8208;C)/Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/Au. By utilizing well&#8208;distributed trapping site with reasonable trapping depth, small tunnelling barriers/distance and high charging energy, the memristor with an ultrafast switching speed of 100 ns, extremely long retention capability of 106 s, a low set voltage (Vset) of &#8764;0.7 V, a substantial ON/OFF ration of 103, and a low spatial variation in cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle (500 cycles) and device&#8208;to&#8208;device characteristics (128 devices) has been demonstrated. On the premise of preserving the strengths of a fast switching speed, this memristor exhibits ultralong retention capability comparable to the commercialized flash memory. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the charge distribution surrounding each Ni atom, single&#8208;atom space&#8208;limited effect of NiSAs/N&#8208;C with special structure of Ni&#8208;N4 has been confirmed. Finally, we have further implemented a memristor ratioed logic (MRL) based combinational memristor array including AND, OR, and XOR logic gate to realize the one&#8208;bit full adder.

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IFN&#947; (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Evolutionary Reinforcement of Polymer Networks: A Stepwise&#8208;Enhanced Strategy for Ultra&#8208;robust Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gel materials are appealing due to their diverse applications in biomedicine, soft electronics, sensors and actuators. Nevertheless, the existing synthetic gels are often plagued by feeble network structures and inherent defects associated with solvents, which compromise their mechanical load&#8208;bearing capacity and cast persistent doubts about their reliability. Herein, combined with attractive deep eutectic solvent (DES), we have presented a stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy to fabricate ultra&#8208;robust eutectogels. It focuses on the continuous modulation and optimization of polymer networks through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes, which drives a progressive increase in both quantity and mass of the interconnected polymer chains at microscopic scale, hence contributing to the evolutionary enhancement of network structure. The resultant eutectogel exhibits superb mechanical properties, including record&#8208;breaking strength (31.8&#160;MPa), toughness (76.0&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (25.6&#160;MPa), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation. Moreover, this eutectogel is able to be further programmed through photolithography to in&#8208;situ create patterned eutectogel for imparting specific functionalities. Enhanced by its broad applicability to various DES combinations, this stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is poised to serve as a crucial template and methodology for the future development of robust gels.

&lt;p&gt;Gel materials are appealing due to their diverse applications in biomedicine, soft electronics, sensors and actuators. Nevertheless, the existing synthetic gels are often plagued by feeble network structures and inherent defects associated with solvents, which compromise their mechanical load-bearing capacity and cast persistent doubts about their reliability. Herein, combined with attractive deep eutectic solvent (DES), we have presented a stepwise-enhanced strategy to fabricate ultra-robust eutectogels. It focuses on the continuous modulation and optimization of polymer networks through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes, which drives a progressive increase in both quantity and mass of the interconnected polymer chains at microscopic scale, hence contributing to the evolutionary enhancement of network structure. The resultant eutectogel exhibits superb mechanical properties, including record-breaking strength (31.8&#160;MPa), toughness (76.0&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and Young's modulus (25.6&#160;MPa), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation. Moreover, this eutectogel is able to be further programmed through photolithography to in-situ create patterned eutectogel for imparting specific functionalities. Enhanced by its broad applicability to various DES combinations, this stepwise-enhanced strategy is poised to serve as a crucial template and methodology for the future development of robust gels.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite of the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge&#8208;storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, we elucidate a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#8211;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#8211;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates five&#8208;fold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#8211;Si bond. We also observe that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#8211;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, we also show that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the three&#8208;fold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental XPS data.

         <title>Diffusible Capping Layer Enabled Homogeneous Crystallization and Component Distribution of Hybrid Sequential Deposited Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nowadays the development of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposition (HSD) method has special meaning on textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the common issues of insufficient reaction caused by blocking of perovskite capping layer have been exacerbated in HSD, because evaporated precursors are usually denser with higher crystallinity and the widely used additive&#8208;assisted microstructure is also difficult to access. Here we presented a facile &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; (DPCL) strategy to solve this dilemma. With DPCL, crystallization alleviation of perovskite and more diffusion channels of organic salts can be realized simultaneously, contributing to a homogenization process. The resultant perovskite films exhibited complete conversion, uniform crystallization, enhanced quality and reduced defect, leading to obviously improvements in device efficiency, repeatability, and stability. This work offers a way to promote the development of textured tandems a step further.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights recent representative research progress using metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their composites with antibacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity for the treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. It is, therefore, reviewed the structural&#8211;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discusses how their multifunctionality and customizability can be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Crystallization Control for Ambient Printed FA&#8208;Based Lead Triiodide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization dynamics of &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskites during ambient blade coating are manipulated by employing an additive 1&#8208;butylpyridine tetrafluoroborate (BPyBF4), resulting in the highly crystalline perovskite film with large grains, eliminated voids, and reduced defects. This enables the high power conversion efficiencies of 23.50% and 21.60% for a 0.09 cm2 area device and a 5&#160;cm &#215; 5 cm&#8208;area module, respectively.








Abstract
Upscalable printing of high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is highly desired for commercialization. However, the efficiencies of printed PSCs lag behind those of their lab&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coated counterparts owing to the lack of systematic understanding and control over perovskite crystallization dynamics. Here, the controlled crystallization dynamics achieved using an additive 1&#8208;butylpyridine tetrafluoroborate (BPyBF4) for high&#8208;quality ambient printed &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films are reported. Using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and optical diagnostics, the spontaneous formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from precursors during printing without the involvement of &#160;&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is demonstrated. The addition of BPyBF4 delays the crystallization onset of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhances the conversion from sol&#8208;gel to perovskite, and reduces stacking defects during printing. Therefore, the altered crystallization results in fewer voids, larger grains, and less trap&#8208;induced recombination loss within printed films. The printed PSCs yield high power conversion efficiencies of 23.50% and 21.60% for a&#160;0.09 cm&#8211;2area device and a 5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm&#8208;area module, respectively. Improved device stability is further demonstrated, i.e., approximately 94% of the initial efficiency is retained for over 2400&#160;h under ambient conditions without encapsulation. This study provides an effective crystallization control method for the ambient printing manufacture of large&#8208;area high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel Nir Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound Fwhm Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
There is strong demand for ultra&#8208;efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;UV LED&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED was fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature-dependent decay times. The ultra-broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor-converted LED was fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra-broadband NIR pc-LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high-performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manipulating Vertical Phase Separation Enables Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency via Ternary Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling vertical phase separation of the active layer to enable efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport is crucial to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, how to optimize the vertical phase separation of PPHJ OSCs via molecule design is rarely reported yet. Herein, ternary polymerization strategy is employed to develop a series of polymer donors, DL1&#8208;DL4, and regulate their solubility, molecular aggregation, molecular orientation and miscibility, thus efficiently manipulating vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs. Among them, DL1 not only has enhanced solubility, inhibited molecular aggregation and partial edge&#8208;on orientation to facilitate acceptor molecules, Y6, to permeate into polymer layer and increase donor/acceptor interfaces, but also sustains high crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6 to acquire ordered molecular packing, thus achieving optimized vertical phase separation to well juggle exciton dissociation and charge transport in PPHJ devices. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs gain the best exciton dissociation probability, highest charge carrier mobilities and weakest charge recombination, and thus afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record value for terpolymer donors. It demonstrates that ternary polymerization is an efficient method to optimize vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Reducing Perovskite/C60 Interface Losses via Sequential Interface Engineering for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells hold tremendous potential for realizing efficient tandem solar cells. However, nonradiative recombination and carrier transport losses occurring at the perovskite/electron&#8208;selective contact (e. g. C60) interface present significant obstacles in approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. To address this, we implement a sequential interface engineering (SIE) strategy that involves the deposition of ethylenediamine diiodide (EDAI2) followed by sequential deposition of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Phenethylammonium chloride (4F&#8208;PEACl). The SIE technique synergistically narrows the conduction band offset and reduces recombination velocity at the perovskite/C60 interface. The best&#8208;performing WBG perovskite solar cell (1.67&#160;eV) delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.8% and an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.262&#160;V. Moreover, through integration with double&#8208;textured silicon featuring submicrometer pyramid structures, we attained a stabilized PCE of 29.6% for a 1 cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell (certified PCE of 29.0%).

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Diversity of Coke Deposits on Nano&#8208;Printed Metal Catalysts Visualized by Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract
Coke formation is the prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon wastes block the catalyst surface and hinder further reaction in a broad gamut of industrial chemical processes. Yet, the origins of coke formation and their distribution across the catalyst remain elusive, obstructing the design of coke&#8208;resistant catalysts. Here, we demonstrate the first&#8208;time application of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) as a nanoscale chemical probe to localize and identify coke deposits on a post&#8208;mortem metal nanocatalyst. Monitoring coke at the nanoscale circumvents bulk averaging and reveals the local nature of coke with unmatched detail. The nature of coke is chemically diverse and ranges from nanocrystalline graphite to disordered and polymeric coke, even on a single nanoscale location of a top&#8208;down nano&#8208;printed SiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. Surprisingly, not all Pt is an equal producer of coke, where clear isolated coke &#8220;hotspots&#8221; are present non&#8208;homogeneously on Pt which generate large amounts of disordered coke. After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long&#8208;range transport on the surrounding SiO2 surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free&#8208;up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long&#8208;term catalyst stability.

         <title>Water&#8208;mediated Selectivity Control of Ch3oh Versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe was implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by a two&#8208;step anodization strategy and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization process. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to highly efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to as high as 154.20&#160;&#956;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the total yield of gaseous products CO/CH4 was 147.48&#160;&#956;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt; 99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr nanotube arrays and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8208;solid and gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8764;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce important chemical feedstock of CH3OH.

Moreover, harnessing the high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials, these windows have the potential to generate power, thereby realizing more advanced windows with combined light modulation and energy harvesting capabilities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in various chromic perovskite materials for achieving light modulation, focusing on both perovskite structures and underlying switching mechanisms. The discussion also encompasses device engineering strategies for smart windows, including the improvement of their optical and transition performance, durability, combination with electricity generation, and the evaluation of their energy&#8208;saving performance in building applications. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with perovskite smart windows are explicated, aimed at stimulating more academic research and advancing their pragmatic implementation for building energy efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>

Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, we devised a novel approach by fragmenting graphitic carbon nitride into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4), followed by subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boosted charge dynamics and facilitated more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrated outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#956;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt; 91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpassed pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperformed previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>Synthesis of 2H/fcc&#8208;Heterophase AuCu Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2H/fcc&#8208;heterophase AuCu hierarchical nanostructures, i.e., Au99Cu1 and Au91Cu9, are synthesized via a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets show superior performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction toward the CO production at industrial current densities due to the unique structural features, including unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. 








Abstract
Structural engineering of nanomaterials offers a promising way for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts toward catalysis. However, the delicate modulation of thermodynamically unfavorable nanostructures with unconventional phases still remains a challenge. Here, the synthesis of hierarchical AuCu nanostructures is reported with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H&#8208;type)/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects (e.g., stacking faults, twin boundaries, and grain boundaries), and tunable Cu content. The obtained 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 hierarchical nanosheets exhibit excellent performance for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO, outperforming the 2H/fcc Au91Cu9 and fcc Au99Cu1. The experimental results, especially those obtained by in&#8208;situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, suggest that the enhanced catalytic performance of 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 arises from the unconventional 2H/fcc heterophase, high&#8208;index facets, planar defects, and appropriate alloying of Cu. Impressively, the 2H/fcc Au99Cu1 shows CO Faradaic efficiencies of 96.6% and 92.6% at industrial current densities of 300 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, as well as good durability, placing it among the best CO2 reduction electrocatalysts for CO production. The atomically structural regulation based on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) provides an avenue for the rational design and preparation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Engineering the Intrinsic Chirality of Plasmonic Au@Pd Metamaterials for Highly Sensitive Chiroplasmonic Hydrogen Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the chiroplasmonic properties of helicoid Au nanoparticles and the sensing capability of Pd, helicoid Au@Pd nanoparticles with intrinsic chirality are constructed as metamaterials for chiroplasmonic hydrogen sensing. The helicoid Au@Pd nanoparticles display an unprecedented sensitivity exceeding all plasmonic hydrogen sensors in the visible range, as evidenced by substantial circular dichroism red&#8208;shift up to 206.1&#160;nm upon hydrogen uptake.








Abstract
Metal helicoid nanoparticles with intrinsic 3D chiral structures have emerged as a new class of plasmonic metamaterials with outstanding chiroplasmonic properties. Despite the considerable potential of metal helicoid nanoparticles in chiroplasmonic sensing, their sensing capabilities remain elusive, stressing the need for the rational chirality engineering of helicoid nanoparticles. In this report, Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles with engineered chiroplasmonic properties and integrated hydrogen sensing capabilities are rationally synthesized. As chiroplasmonic metamaterials, the Au@Pd helicoid nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity for hydrogen chiroplasmonic sensing in the visible range. A significant circular dichroism red&#8208;shift as large as 206.1&#160;nm can be achieved when they are exposed to hydrogen. Such a high sensitivity outperforms all the plasmonic hydrogen sensors in the visible range. Besides sensitivity, the chiroplasmonic sensing platform shows a good linear range of 1.5&#8211;6.0% hydrogen concentration with higher figure of merit, excellent selectivity, and good reusability. To further demonstrate its applicability, this chiroplasmonic hydrogen sensing platform is utilized to investigate hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics on Pd. This study heralds a new paradigm for plasmonic hydrogen sensing and highlights the tremendous potential of utilizing helicoid nanoparticles as chiroplasmonic sensing metamaterials by chirality engineering.

         <title>Thermal Rectification in Modularly Designed Bulk Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal rectification is a phenomenon of great practical importance where heat transfer is preferential in one direction. Programmable control of heat transfer in 3D space is key to enable thermal rectification at the macroscale but is rarely realized in natural materials or in current existing devices that are constructed at the nano and micro scales with high system complexity. Here, modularly designed bulk metamaterials that can break the symmetry of heat transfer from one direction to the other are created, leading to thermal rectification in convergent or divergent states by tuning the metamaterial microstructural design. These thermal metamaterials are microstructured composites made using one material composition, however, they offer sufficient microstructural design freedom to allow tunable local thermal properties for unusual macroscopic heat transfer. The strategy and performance achieved are promising for next&#8208;generation thermal management.

         <title>An &#8220;AND&#8221; Logic&#8208;Gated Prodrug Micelle Locally Stimulates Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials that can respond to multiple biomarkers simultaneously, acting as an &#8220;AND&#8221; gate, have the potential to enhance tumor&#8208;targeting for drug delivery. In this study, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;controlled release prodrug micelle is developed for co&#8208;delivering the chemotherapeutic and the STING agonist, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. The drug release is programmed by tumor&#8208;enriched boramino acids (BAA) in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in enhanced tumor targeting. STING agonist is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions. These AND logic&#8208;gated prodrug micelles can achieve tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of STING agonist, leading to significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy in vivo. It is expected that this clinically relevant nano&#8208;platform will provide a rational design of an effective immunotherapy combination regimen to convert immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, addressing the major challenges faced by immunotherapies.

&lt;p&gt;Materials that can respond to multiple biomarkers simultaneously, acting as an &#8220;AND&#8221; gate, have the potential to enhance tumor-targeting for drug delivery. In this study, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic-controlled release prodrug micelle is developed for co-delivering the chemotherapeutic and the STING agonist, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. The drug release is programmed by tumor-enriched boramino acids (BAA) in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in enhanced tumor targeting. STING agonist is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions. These AND logic-gated prodrug micelles can achieve tumor-targeted delivery of STING agonist, leading to significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy in vivo. It is expected that this clinically relevant nano-platform will provide a rational design of an effective immunotherapy combination regimen to convert immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, addressing the major challenges faced by immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mnemonic Rutile&#8211;Rutile Interfaces Triggering Spontaneous Dissociation of Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water interaction with mineral surfaces is a complex living system decisive for any photocatalytic process. Resolving atomistic structure of mineral&#8211;water interfaces is thus crucial for understanding these processes. Fibrous rutile TiO2, grown hydrothermally on twinned rutile seeds under acidic conditions, was studied in terms of interface translation, atomic structure and surface chemistry in the presence of water, by means of advanced microscopy and spectroscopy methods combined with structure modeling and density functional theory calculations. We show that fibers while staying in stable separation during their growth, adopt special crystallographic registry that is controlled by repulsion forces between fully hydroxylated and protonated (110) surfaces. During relaxation, a turbulent proton transfer and cracking of O&#8211;H bonds is observed, generating a strong acidic character via proton jump from bridge &#8211;OHb to terminal &#8211;OHt groups, and spontaneous dissociation of interfacial water via a transient protonation of the &#8211;OHt groups. It is shown, that this specific interface structure can be implemented to induce acidic response in initially neutral medium, when re&#8211;immersed. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a 2D, quantum confined mineral&#8211;water interface, capable of memorizing its past and conveying its structurally encoded properties into a new environment.

         <title>Achieving Reliable and Ultrafast Memristors via Artificial Filaments in Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical implementation of memristors in neuromorphic computing and bio&#8208;mimetic sensing suffers from unexpected temporal and spatial variations due to the stochastic formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs). Here, we patterned the bio&#8208;compatible silk fibroin (SF) with an on&#8208;demand nanocone array by using thermal scanning probe lithography (t&#8208;SPL) to guide and confine the growth of CFs in the Silver/Silk Fibroin/Gold (Ag/SF/Au) memristor. Benefiting from the high fabrication controllability, cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle (temporal) standard deviation of the set voltage for the structured memristor has been significantly reduced by &#8764;95.5% (from 1.535 V to 0.0686 V) and the device&#8208;to&#8208;device (spatial) standard deviation has also been reduced to 0.0648 V. Besides, the statistical relationship between the structural nanocone design and the resultant performance was confirmed, optimizing at the small operation voltage (&#8764;0.5 V) and current (100 nA), ultrafast switching speed (sub&#8208;100 ns), large on/off ratio (104), and the smallest switching slope (SS &lt; 0.01 mV/dec). Finally, the short&#8208;term plasticity and leaky integrated&#8208;and&#8208;fire behavior were emulated, and a reliable thermal nociceptor system was demonstrated for practical neuromorphic applications.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy (SPDT) is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8208;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects were successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated led to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy was realized. Our study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Controlled Growth of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Nanoribbons on 1H&#8208;MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) heterostructures are emerging as alternatives to conventional semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium, and gallium nitride, for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics owing to their ultrathin thickness, absence of dangling bonds, and strong light&#8208;matter interaction. However, the direct growth of 2D heterostructures, especially for those with metastable phases still remains challenging. To obtain 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with designed phases, it is highly desired to develop phase&#8208;controlled synthetic strategies. Here, a facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is reported to prepare vertical 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structures. By simply changing the growth atmosphere, semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 can be in&#8208;situ grown on the top of semiconducting 1H&#8208;MoS2, forming vertical semiconductor/semi&#8208;metal 1H/1T&#8242; heterophase structures with a sharp interface. The integrated device based on the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structure displays a typical rectifying behavior with a current rectifying ratio of &#8764;103. Moreover, the 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2&#8208;based photodetector achieves a responsivity of 1.07 A/W at 532&#160;nm with an ultra&#8208;low dark current of less than 10&#8722;11 A. The aforementioned results indicate that 1H/1T&#8242; MoS2 heterophase structures could be a promising candidate for the future rectifiers and photodetectors. Importantly, our approach might pave the way toward tailoring the phases of TMDs, which can help us understand and utilize phase engineering strategies to promote the performance of electronic devices.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Efficient Boron Interstitially Inserted Ru Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, boron interstitially inserted ruthenium (B&#8208;Ru/C) has been synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for AEMFC, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2, close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial PtRu catalyst. Unexpectedly, instead of the monotonous decline of HOR kinetics with pH as generally believed, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent HOR kinetics on B&#8208;Ru/C is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the upshifted d&#8208;band center of Ru after the intervention of interstitial boron could lead to enhanced adsorption ability of OH and H2O, which together with the reduced energy barrier of water formation, contributes to the outstanding alkaline HOR performance with a mass activity of 1.716&#160;mA &#956;gPGM&#8722;1, which is 13.4&#8208;fold and 5.2&#8208;fold higher than that of Ru/C and commercial Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomaterials for The Immunomodulation of The Cardiosplenic Axis Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>

Abstract
The spleen is an important mediator of both adaptive and innate immunity. As such, attempts to modulate the immune response provided by the spleen may be conducive to improved outcomes for numerous diseases throughout the body. Here, we use biomimicry to rationally design nanomaterials capable of splenic retention and immunomodulation for the treatment of disease in a distant organ, the post&#8208;infarct heart. Engineered senescent erythrocyte&#8208;derived nanotheranostic (eSENTs) were generated, demonstrating significant uptake by the immune cells of the spleen including T and B cells, as well as monocytes and macrophages. When loaded with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), the nanoagents exhibit a potent therapeutic effect, reducing infarct size by 14% at 72 hours post&#8208;myocardial infarction when given as a single intravenous dose 2 hours after injury. These results are supportive of our hypothesis that RBC&#8208;derived biomimicry may provide new approaches for the targeted modulation of the pathological processes involved in myocardial infarction, thus further experiments to decisively confirm the mechanisms of action are currently underway. This novel concept may have far&#8208;reaching applicability for the treatment of a number of both acute and chronic conditions where the immune responses are either stimulated or suppressed by the splenic (auto)immune milieu.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Coated Bacteria Hitchhike on CD11b+ Immune Cells to Boost Tumor Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Bacterial&#8208;based delivery strategies have recently emerged as a unique research direction in the field of drug delivery. However, bacterial vectors are quickly phagocytosed by immune cells after entering the bloodstream. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, herein, we seek to harness the potential of immune cells to delivery micron&#8208;sized bacterial vectors, and find that inactivated bacterial could accumulate at tumor&#8208;site after intravenous injection through CD11b+ cells hitchhiking. To this end, we then design a gold&#8208;platinum bimetallic nanozyme coated bacterial vector (Au&#8208;Pt@VNP20009, APV). Utilizing strong tumor inflammatory response induced by low dose X&#8208;rays, we further heighten the ability of CD11b+ immune cells to assist APV hitchhiking for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery, which could significantly relieve tumor hypoxia and immunosuppression, and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Our work elucidates the potential mechanisms of bacterial vector targeted delivery, opening up new horizons for bacterial vector delivery strategies and clinical tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of High&#8208;Harmonic Generation with Resonance&#8208;Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry&#8208;dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here we&#160;tackle this limitation and introduce an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light&#8208;matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. We&#160;design and fabricate resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone&#8208;like nanoresonators which are made of germanium, and they support high&#8208;Q optical resonances in the mid&#8208;IR spectral range. We&#160;apply this general concept to observe the resonant enhancement of the 3rd and 5th harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical&#160;harmonics.

         <title>Chirality Versus Symmetry: Electron's Spin Selectivity in Nonpolar Chiral Lead&#8211;Bromide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D chiral halide perovskites crystallizing in nonpolar enantiomorphic space groups present incomplete Rashba&#8208;like splittings of the bottom conduction and top valence bands, resulting in rare spin textures and chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. The electron's spin polarization in these stable thin films allows the fabrication of chiro&#8208;spintronic devices such as spin valves.








Abstract
In the last decade, chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the spin&#8208;selective electron transport through chiral molecules, has been described in a large range of materials, from insulators to superconductors. Because more experimental studies are desired for the theoretical understanding of the CISS effect, chiral metal&#8208;halide semiconductors may contribute to the field thanks to their chiroptical and spintronic properties. In this regard, this work uses new chiral organic cations S&#8208;HP1A and R&#8208;HP1A (HP1A = 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;propyl&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium) to prepare 2D chiral halide perovskites (HPs) which crystallize in the enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The fourfold symmetry induces antiferroelectricity along the stacking axis which, combined to incomplete Rashba&#8208;like splitting in each individual 2D polar layer, results in rare spin textures in the band structure. As revealed by magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, these materials show CISS effect with partial spin polarization (SP; &#177;40&#8211;45%). This incomplete effect is efficient enough to drive a chiro&#8208;spintronic device as demonstrated by the fabrication of spin valve devices with magnetoresistance (MR) responses up to 250 K. Therefore, these stable lead&#8211;bromide HP materials not only represent interesting candidates for spintronic applications but also reveal the importance of polar symmetry&#8208;breaking topology for spin selectivity.

         <title>Modulation of Radical Intermediates in Rechargeable Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances about organic radicals in organic electrode materials are reviewed. This review summarizes the importance, the development history, and the formation mechanism of organic radicals in rechargeable organic batteries. Regulation strategies of organic radicals to improve the electrochemical performance of organic electrodes are highlighted. Challenges and perspectives for organic batteries based on radical chemistry are also discussed.








Abstract
Organic materials have been considered as promising electrodes for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries in view of their sustainability, structural flexibility, and potential recyclability. The radical intermediates generated during the redox process of organic electrodes have profound effect on the reversible capacity, operation voltage, rate performance, and cycling stability. However, the radicals are highly reactive and have very short lifetime during the redox of organic materials. Great efforts have been devoted to capturing and investigating the radical intermediates in organic electrodes. Herein, this review summarizes the importance, history, structures, and working principles of organic radicals in rechargeable batteries. More importantly, challenges and strategies to track and regulate the radicals in organic batteries are highlighted. Finally, further perspectives of organic radicals are proposed for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance rechargeable organic batteries.

Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Charged Defects with Multiple Active Sited Macrocyclic Valinomycin for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a macrocyclic material valinomycin (VM) with multiple &#9472;C&#9552;O, &#9472;NH, and &#9472;O&#9472; groups is utilized to manage charged defects by passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ and compensating formamidine vacancy at perovskite surface. VM modification also induces a favorable energy band bending. These advances boost the power conversion efficiency from 21.97% to 24.06% for inverted perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The unavoidably positively and negatively charged defects at the interface between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) often lead to severe surface recombination and unfavorable energy level alignment in inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Inserting interlayers at this interface is an effective approach to eliminate charged defects. Herein, the macrocyclic molecule valinomycin (VM) with multiple active sites of &#9472;C&#9552;O, &#9472;NH, and &#9472;O&#9472; is employed as an interlayer at the perovskite/ETL contact to simultaneously eliminate positively and negatively charged defects. Combined with a series of theoretical calculations and experimental analyzes, it is demonstrated that the &#9472;C&#9552;O and &#9472;O&#9472; groups in VM can immobilize the uncoordinated Pb2+ to manage the positively charged defect and the formation of N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding can recompense the formamidine vacancies to eliminate the negatively charged defect. In addition, the VM interlayer induces a favorable downshift band bending at the perovskite/ETL interface, facilitating charge separation and boosting charge transfer. Thanks to the reduced charged defects and favorable energy level alignment, the fabricated inverted PerSC delivers an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 24.06% with excellent long&#8208;term ambient and thermal stability. This work demonstrates that managing charged defects via multiple functional groups and simultaneously regulating energy level alignment is a reliable strategy to boost the performance of PerSCs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Multi&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing: Active Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since the pioneering work of Kawata and colleagues in 1997, multi&#8208;photon 3D laser printing, also known as direct laser writing (DLW), has made significant advancements in a wide range of fields. Moreover, the development and commercialization of photocurable inks for this technique have expanded rapidly. One of the current trends is the transition from static to active printable materials, often referred to as 4D microprinting, which enables a new degree of control in the printed systems. This review focuses on four primary application areas: microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics, and life sciences, highlighting recent progress and the crucial role of active materials, including liquid crystalline elastomers, hydrogels, shape memory polymers and composites, among others. It also addresses ongoing challenges and provides insights into the future prospects in the different fields.

         <title>Ultrathin, Cationic Covalent Organic Nanosheets for Enhanced CO2&#160;Electroreduction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metalloporphyrins and Metallophthalocyanines have emerged as popular building blocks to develop covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, existing CONs predominantly yield CO, posing a challenge in achieving efficient methanol production through multielectron reduction. Here we report ultrathin, cationic, and cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based CONs (iminium&#8208;CONs) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. The integration of quaternary iminium groups enables the formation of ultrathin morphology with uniformly anchored cobalt active sites, which are pivotal for facilitating rapid multielectron transfer. Moreover, rotating&#8208;disk voltammetry shows that the cationic iminium&#8208;CONs exhibit a lower activity for hydrogen evolution side reaction. Consequently, iminium&#8208;CONs manifest significantly enhanced selectivity for methanol production, as evidenced by a remarkable 711% and 270% improvement in methanol partial current density (jCH3OH) compared to pristine CoTAPc and neutral imine&#8208;CONs, respectively. Under optimized conditions, iminium&#8208;CONs deliver a high jCH3OH of 91.7 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.78 V in a flow cell. Furthermore, iminium&#8208;CONs achieve a global FECH3OH of 54% in a tandem device. Thanks to the single&#8208;site feature, the methanol is produced without the concurrent generation of other liquid byproducts. This work underscores the potential of cationic covalent organic nanosheets as a compelling platform for electrochemical six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol.

         <title>Turing Instability of Liquid&#8208;Solid Metal Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The classical Turing morphogenesis often occurs in non&#8208;metallic solution systems due to the sole competition of reaction and diffusion processes. Here we conceived that gallium (Ga)&#8208;based liquid metals possess the ability to alloy, diffuse, and react with a range of solid metals and thus should display Turing instability leading to a variety of nonequilibrium spatial concentration patterns. We disclosed a general mechanism for obtaining labyrinths, stripes, and spots&#8208;like stationary Turing patterns in the liquid&#8208;solid metal reaction&#8208;diffusion systems (GaX&#8208;Y), taking the gallium indium alloy and silver substrate (GaIn&#8208;Ag) system as a proof of concept. It is only when Ga atoms diffuse over Y much faster than X while X reacts with Y preferentially, that Turing instability occurs. In such a metallic system, Ga serves as an inhibitor and X as an activator. The dominant factors in tuning the patterning process include temperature and concentration. Intermetallic compounds contained in the Turing patterns and their competitive reactions have also been further clarified.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classical Turing morphogenesis often occurs in non-metallic solution systems due to the sole competition of reaction and diffusion processes. Here we conceived that gallium (Ga)-based liquid metals possess the ability to alloy, diffuse, and react with a range of solid metals and thus should display Turing instability leading to a variety of nonequilibrium spatial concentration patterns. We disclosed a general mechanism for obtaining labyrinths, stripes, and spots-like stationary Turing patterns in the liquid-solid metal reaction-diffusion systems (GaX-Y), taking the gallium indium alloy and silver substrate (GaIn-Ag) system as a proof of concept. It is only when Ga atoms diffuse over Y much faster than X while X reacts with Y preferentially, that Turing instability occurs. In such a metallic system, Ga serves as an inhibitor and X as an activator. The dominant factors in tuning the patterning process include temperature and concentration. Intermetallic compounds contained in the Turing patterns and their competitive reactions have also been further clarified. This liquid metal Turing instability mechanism opens many opportunities for constructing micro-structure systems utilizing condensed matter to experimentally explore the general morphogenesis process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation Over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultra&#8208;Small Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>

Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g. the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, we develop a synergistic strategy for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4&#8208;nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol&#183;gCo&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy And Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allows monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, we construct a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging (FLI) of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Ion Engineering Strategies toward High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes and names various types of multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies. The recent advances of aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries are presented, and the reaction mechanisms, application effects, merits, and disadvantages of different multi&#8208;ion strategies are comprehensively evaluated to provide guidance for the development of ideal aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
As alternatives to batteries with organic electrolytes, aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studied. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of the cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of the cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carrier is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, this is the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, and future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high performance.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Management and Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work summarizes the advances in morphology optimization in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells from the viewpoint of efficient charge management and energy loss reduction, aiming to provide useful guidance in further materials design and device optimization and promote further development of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) have received tremendous attention in recent decades because of their advantages over their polymer counterparts. These advantages include well&#8208;defined chemical structures, easy purification, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation. Remarkable progress with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17% has recently been achieved with improved charge management (FF &#215; JSC) and reduced energy loss (Eloss). Morphology control is the key factor in the progress of ASM&#8208;OSCs, which remains a significant challenge because of the similarities in the molecular structures of the donors and acceptors. In this review, the effective strategies for charge management and/or Eloss reduction from the perspective of effective morphology control are summarized. The aim is to provide practical insights and guidance for material design and device optimization to promote further development of ASM&#8208;OSCs to a level where they can compete with or even surpass the efficiency of polymer solar cells.

         <title>Exploiting Unique Features of Microneedles to Modulate Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedle arrays (MNAs) are patches containing short projections long enough to reach dense immune cells below the skin, but short enough to avoid pain receptors. This review focuses on studies in the past 4 years utilizing MNAs to deliver vaccines and immunotherapies to improve disease outcomes.








Abstract
Microneedle arrays (MNAs) are small patches containing hundreds of short projections that deliver signals directly to dermal layers without causing pain. These technologies are of special interest for immunotherapy and vaccine delivery because they directly target immune cells concentrated in the skin. The targeting abilities of MNAs result in efficient immune responses&#8212;often more protective or therapeutic&#8212;compared to conventional needle delivery. MNAs also offer logistical benefits, such as self&#8208;administration and transportation without refrigeration. Thus, numerous preclinical and clinical studies are exploring these technologies. Here the unique advantages of MNA, as well as critical challenges&#8212;such as manufacturing and sterility issues&#8212;the field faces to enable widespread deployment are discussed. How MNA design parameters can be exploited for controlled release of vaccines and immunotherapies, and the application to preclinical models of infection, cancer, autoimmunity, and allergies are explained. Specific strategies are also discussed to reduce off&#8208;target effects compared to conventional vaccine delivery routes, and novel chemical and manufacturing controls that enable cargo stability in MNAs across flexible intervals and temperatures. Clinical research using MNAs is then examined. Drawbacks of MNAs and the implications, and emerging opportunities to exploit MNAs for immune engineering and clinical use are concluded.

         <title>Liquid Metal Combinatorics toward Materials Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article&#160;systematically presents a generalized theoretical frame termed as &#8220;Liquid Metal Combinatorics&#8221; (LMC), and summarized promising candidate technical routes toward new generation liquid metals&#8208;derived functional material discovery. Here, the connotation of LiMjCks$C_k^s$ represents the interaction of liquid metal raw material Li with other materials Mj to generate all possible combinations (Cks$C_k^s$), thus deriving abundant, diverse combination opportunities.








Abstract
Liquid metals and their derivatives provide several opportunities for fundamental and practical exploration worldwide. However, the increasing number of studies and shortage of desirable materials to fulfill different needs also pose serious challenges. Herein, to address this issue, a generalized theoretical frame that is termed as &#8220;Liquid Metal Combinatorics&#8221; (LMC) is systematically presented, and summarizes promising candidate technical routes toward new generation material discovery. The major categories of LMC are defined, and eight representative methods for manufacturing advanced materials are outlined. It is illustrated that abundant targeted materials can be efficiently designed and fabricated via LMC through deep physical combinations, chemical reactions, or both among the main bodies of liquid metals, surface chemicals, precipitated ions, and other materials. This represents a large class of powerful, reliable, and modular methods for innovating general materials. The achieved combinatorial materials not only maintained the typical characteristics of liquid metals but also displayed distinct tenability. Furthermore, the fabrication strategies, wide extensibility, and pivotal applications of LMC are classified. Finally, by interpreting the developmental trends in the area, a perspective on the LMC is provided, which warrants its promising future for society.

         <title>Recent Advances in Biodegradable Green Electronic Materials and Sensor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As environmental issues have become more serious, the necessity for green and biodegradable electronics has been raised. Recent advances in biodegradable conductive materials enable next&#8208;gen electronics. The potent green materials have been applied to practical applications. In this review, various sensor devices based on biodegradable conductive materials are summarized.








Abstract
As environmental issues have become the dominant agenda worldwide, the necessity for more environmentally friendly electronics has recently emerged. Accordingly, biodegradable or nature&#8208;derived materials for green electronics have attracted increased interest. Initially, metal&#8208;green hybrid electronics are extensively studied. Although these materials are partially biodegradable, they have high utility owing to their metallic components. Subsequently, carbon&#8208;framed materials (such as graphite, cylindrical carbon nanomaterials, graphene, graphene oxide, laser&#8208;induced graphene) have been investigated. This has led to the adoption of various strategies for carbon&#8208;based materials, such as blending them with biodegradable materials. Moreover, various conductive polymers have been developed and researchers have studied their potential use in green electronics. Researchers have attempted to fabricate conductive polymer composites with high biodegradability by shortening the polymer chains. Furthermore, various physical, chemical, and biological sensors that are essential to modern society have been studied using biodegradable compounds. These recent advances in green electronics have paved the way toward their application in real life, providing a brighter future for society.

         <title>Biofluid&#8208;Activated Biofuel Cells, Batteries, and Supercapacitors: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive assessment of the new, emerging field of biofluid&#8208;activated energy devices with an emphasis on materials innovation, device design engineering, and systems integration. Sections cover fundamentals and the latest examples of biofluid&#8208;activated biofuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. In&#8208;depth discussions on grand challenges and future prospects are also presented.








Abstract
Recent developments in wearable and implanted devices have resulted in numerous, unprecedented capabilities that generate increasingly detailed information about a user's health or provide targeted therapy. However, options for powering such systems remain limited to conventional batteries which are large and have toxic components and as such are not suitable for close integration with the human body. This work provides an in&#8208;depth overview of biofluid&#8208;activated electrochemical energy devices, an emerging class of energy sources judiciously designed for biomedical applications. These unconventional energy devices are composed of biocompatible materials that harness the inherent chemistries of various biofluids to produce useable electrical energy. This work covers examples of such biofluid&#8208;activated energy devices in the form of biofuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. Advances in materials, design engineering, and biotechnology that form the basis for high&#8208;performance, biofluid&#8208;activated energy devices are discussed. Innovations in hybrid manufacturing and heterogeneous integration of device components to maximize power output are also included. Finally, key challenges and future scopes of this nascent field are provided.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Nanovaccine that Enhances T&#8208;Cell Responses and Efficacy Through Dual Interactions with Dendritic Cells and T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovaccine comprising cancer cell membrane, monophosphoryl lipid A, and anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (named CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28) activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells by interacting with both dendritic cells (DCs) and na&#239;ve T cells. CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 exhibits higher efficacy in tumor&#8208;specific T cell activation and tumor inhibition than nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or na&#239;ve T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28).








Abstract
Conventional approaches to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that primarily activate tumor&#8208;specific T cells via dendritic cells (DCs) often demonstrate limited efficacy due to the suboptimal activation of these T cells. To address this limitation, here a therapeutic cancer nanovaccine is developed that enhances T cell responses by interacting with both DCs and T cells. The nanovaccine is based on a cancer cell membrane nanoparticle (CCM&#8208;MPLA) that utilizes monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. To allow direct interaction between the nanovaccine and tumor&#8208;specific T cells, anti&#8208;CD28 antibodies (aCD28) are conjugated onto CCM&#8208;MPLA, resulting in CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28. This nanovaccine activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in both the presence and absence of DCs. Compared with nanovaccines that interact with either DCs (CCM&#8211;MPLA) or T cells (CCM&#8211;aCD28), CCM&#8211;MPLA&#8211;aCD28 induces more potent responses of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and exhibits a higher antitumor efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. No differences in T cell activation efficiency and therapeutic efficacy are observed between CCM&#8211;MPLA and CCM&#8211;aCD28. This approach may lead to the development of effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines prepared from autologous cancer cells.

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxide crystals have garnered considerable attention because of their remarkable physical properties and potential for versatile applications. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the design, preparation, and application of ultrathin 2D oxides, providing many opportunities for new&#8208;generation advanced technologies. This review focuses on the controllable preparation of 2D oxide crystals and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Based on their bonding nature, the various types of 2D oxide crystals are first summarized, including both layered and nonlayered crystals, as well as their current top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches. Subsequently, in terms of the unique physical and electrical properties of 2D oxides, recent advances in device applications are emphasized, including photodetectors, field&#8208;effect transistors, dielectric layers, magnetic and ferroelectric devices, memories, and gas sensors. Finally, conclusions and future prospects of 2D oxide crystals are presented. It is hoped that this review will provide comprehensive and insightful guidance for the development of 2D oxide crystals and their device applications.

         <title>Efficient Surfactant&#8208;Mediated Photovoltaic Manipulation of fL&#8208;Scale Aqueous Microdroplets for Diverse Optofluidic Applications on LiNbO3 Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is reported. The merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets and the microdroplet&#8208;assisted coupling of focused laser beams are demonstrated. Moreover, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved by leveraging the selective permeability of droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets.








Abstract
The electrodeless biocompatible manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets remains challenging. The appropriate isolation of electrostatic charges from femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets is crucial for electrodeless optoelectronic manipulation based on space&#8208;charge&#8208;density modulation. Here, surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation is proposed, where the surfactant layers self&#8208;assembled at the water&#8211;oil and oil&#8211;Lithium niobate&#160;interfaces are employed to isolate photovoltaic charges. The reduced electrostatic attenuation, remarkable hydrophobicity, and strong electrical breakdown suppression of the surfactant layers enable the stable and swift manipulation of femtoliter&#8208;scale aqueous microdroplets using &#181;W&#8208;level laser in oil media. By virtue of the surfactant&#8208;mediated photovoltaic manipulation, a controllable merging/touching/detaching switch of aqueous microdroplets by adjusting the laser illumination intensity and position is realized and the cascading biochemical operations and microreactions of aqueous microdroplets and microdroplet strings are demonstrated. To demonstrate its potential in photonic Micro&#8208;Electro&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;System assemblies, the end coupling of a focused&#8208;laser&#8208;beam into a ZnO microrod leveraging the refraction effect occurring at the water/oil interface is demonstrated. Moreover, because of the selective permeability of the droplet&#8208;interface&#8208;bilayer developed between the touching microdroplets, in situ adjustment of the size of the microdroplets and the fluorescent solute contained in the microdroplets are achieved, aiming at constructing multicomponent fluorescent microdroplets with tunable whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode characteristics.

         <title>Reshaping Zinc Plating/Stripping Behavior by Interfacial Water Bonding for High&#8208;Utilization&#8208;Rate Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel electrolyte is adopted to bond interface water molecules to suppress water activity and alleviate water&#8208;induced side&#160;reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Due to the interface water bonding effect, symmetric Zn cells assemble with the BC hydrogel electrolyte cycle stably and deliver a high utilization rate (&gt;85%) of Zn anode under harsh test conditions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices; however, severe parasitic reactions lead to the exacerbated production of Zn dendrites that decrease the utilization rate of Zn anodes. Decreasing the electrolyte content and regulating the water activity are efficient means to address these issues. Herein, this work shows that limiting the aqueous electrolyte and bonding water to bacterial cellulose (BC) can suppress side reactions and regulate stable Zn plating/stripping. This approach makes it possible to use less electrolyte and limited Zn foil. A symmetric Zn cell assembles with the hydrogel electrolyte with limited electrolyte (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio E/C = 1.0 g (Ah)&#8722;1) cycled stably at a current density of 6.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved a capacity of 6.5 mA h cm&#8722;2 and depth of discharge of 85%. Full cells with the BC hydrogel electrolyte delivers a discharge capacity of 212 mA h cm&#8722;2 and shows a capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work offers new fundamental insights into the effect of restricting water to reshape the Zn plating/stripping process and provides a route for designing novel hydrogel electrolytes to better stabilize and efficiently utilize the Zn anodes.

         <title>Flexible Optoelectronic Multimodal Proximity/Pressure/Temperature Sensors with Low Signal Interference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensors are proposed by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous structure. Self&#8208;decoupled sensing of proximity/pressure/temperature is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics. Negligible signal interference opens up promising paths for multimodal tactile sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile sensors are a crucial part of intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction and collaboration. Simultaneous detection of proximity, pressure, and temperature on a single sensor can greatly promote the safety, interactivity, and compactness of interaction systems. However, severe signal interference and complex decoupling algorithms hinder the actual applications. Here, this work reports a flexible optoelectronic multimodal sensor capable of detecting and decoupling proximity/pressure/temperature by integrating a light waveguide and an interdigital electrode (IDE) into a compact fibrous sensor. Negligible signal interference is realized by combining heterogeneous sensing mechanisms of optics and electronics, which encodes proximity into capacitance, pressure into light intensity and temperature into resistance. The sensor exhibits a large sensing distance of 225 mm with fast responses for proximity detection, a pressure sensitivity of 0.42 N&#8722;1, and a temperature sensitivity of 7% &#176;C&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a doll equipped with the sensor can accurately discriminate and detect various stimuli, thus achieving safe and immersive interactions with the user. This work opens up promising paths for self&#8208;decoupled multimodal sensors and related human/machine/environment interaction applications.

         <title>3D Printing of High Viscosity UV&#8208;Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 3D printed elastomer parts are prepared by using a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization system from high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin. After thermal treatment, the cross&#8208;linking polymerization of the chain extender and the unblocked isocyanate functional group effectively increases the molecular weight of the elastomer rendering a high mechanical performance (&#8776;a strain of 1600% and a stress of &#8776;26&#160;MPa).








Abstract
Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV&#8208;curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan&#8208;based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high&#8208;viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer&#8208;dominated UV&#8208;curable resin via a dual&#8208;curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high&#8208;viscosity UV&#8208;curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D&#8208;printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields.

         <title>Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Iron Hydroxy Fluorides as Low&#8208;Cost Lithium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials for Stationary Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors report a facile and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of pyrochlore iron (III) hydroxy fluoride (Pyr&#8208;IHF), enabling to produce Pyr&#8208;IHF at a low cost. Pyr&#8208;IHF&#8208;containing cathodes show superior capacity retention of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Pyrochlore&#8208;type iron (III) hydroxy fluorides (Pyr&#8208;IHF) are appealing low&#8208;cost stationary energy storage materials due to the virtually unlimited supply of their constituent elements, their high energy densities, and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion. However, the prohibitively high costs of synthesis and cathode architecture currently prevent their commercial use in low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr&#8208;IHF of &gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr&#8208;IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li&#8208;ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr&#8208;IHF, formed by corner&#8208;sharing FeF6&#8211;x(OH)x octahedra.

Herein, a facile and cost-effective dissolution&#8211;precipitation synthesis of Pyr-IHF from soluble iron (III) fluoride precursors is presented. High capacity retention by synthesized Pyr-IHF of &amp;gt;80% after 600&#160;cycles at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained, without elaborate electrode engineering. Operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction guides the selective synthesis of Pyr-IHF such that different water contents can be tested for their effect on the rate capability. Li-ion diffusion is found to occur in the 3D hexagonal channels of Pyr-IHF, formed by corner-sharing FeF&lt;sub&gt;6&#8211;x&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Fluorescent Polymer: Multi&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with High Dissymmetry Factor and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of emissive chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) is constructed by doping chiral fluorescent helical polymer into nematic liquid crystals. Intense multi&#8208;color circular polarized luminescence and circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are achieved, with high dissymmetry factors (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 and &#8722;1.57, respectively. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is further realized based on multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of N*&#8208;LCs.








Abstract
Chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*&#8208;LCs) can tremendously amplify circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Doped emissive N*&#8208;LCs have been substantially explored. However, their CPL performances still need to be improved, mainly due to the unsatisfying helical twisting power (HTP) of commonly used chiral fluorescent dopants. Chiral fluorescent helical polymers (CFHPs) have outstanding optical activity and CPL performance. The present contribution reports the first success in constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs by doping CFHP into nematic liquid crystals (5CB, N&#8208;LCs). The helical assembly structures of N*&#8208;LCs effectively amplify the CPL signals of the CFHP. Owing to the high HTP of CFHP, the selective reflection band of N*&#8208;LC can be adjusted to fully cover its emission band. A nearly pure CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;1.87 is realized at 9&#160;wt% doping concentration. Taking advantage of the selective reflection mechanism, multi&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs with high glum are fabricated via further adding achiral fluorophores. Also noticeably, circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with glum up to &#8722;1.57 is achieved. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting application is demonstrated by exploiting multi&#8208;mode optical characteristics of the created N*&#8208;LCs. The established strategy for constructing emissive N*&#8208;LCs provides a platform for future exploring of CPL&#8208;active N*&#8208;LCs.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal Particle Modified Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest development of nanoscale metal particle modified single&#8208;atom catalysts (NMP&#8208;SACs) from the aspects of synthesis, characterization techniques, and catalytic applications. The mechanism behind their superior performance in various catalytic applications is discussed. The review ends with relevant challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs in the future.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their well&#8208;defined active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency, and unique unsaturated coordinated structures. However, their effectiveness is limited to reactions requiring active sites containing multiple metal atoms. Furthermore, the loading amounts of single&#8208;atom sites must be restricted to prevent aggregation, which can adversely affect the catalytic performance despite the high activity of the individual atoms. The introduction of nanoscale metal particles (NMPs) into SACs (NMP&#8208;SACs) has proven to be an efficient approach for improving their catalytic performance. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to systematically introduce the synthesis, characterization, and application of NMP&#8208;SACs and the mechanisms behind their superior catalytic performance. This review first presents and classifies the different mechanisms through which NMPs enhance the performance of SACs. It then summarizes the currently reported synthetic strategies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of NMP&#8208;SACs. Moreover, their application in electro/thermo/photocatalysis, and the reasons for their superior performance are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs for the future design of advanced catalysts are addressed.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Sites Regulated by Adjacent Single Co Atoms Anchored on N&#8208;P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Structures for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Fe and Co anchored on nitrogen, phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon hollow nanorod structures (FeCo&#8208;NPC) are synthesized via a phytic acid&#8208;assisted atomization process. Due to the electron asymmetric distribution induced by the introduction of the single Co atoms with Co&#8208;N/P coordination, the as&#8208;prepared FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits significantly boosted electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity and excellent zinc&#8208;air battery performance.








Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment and electron distribution for heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level is an effective strategy to improve electrocatalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Co anchored on nitrogen, phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon hollow nanorod structures (FeCo&#8208;NPC) are rationally designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits significantly boosted electrocatalytic kinetics and greatly upshifts the half&#8208;wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, when utilized as the cathode, the FeCo&#8208;NPC catalyst also displays excellent zinc&#8208;air battery performance. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the introduction of single Co atoms with Co&#8208;N/P coordination around isolated Fe atoms induces asymmetric electron distribution, resulting in the suitable adsorption/desorption ability for oxygen intermediates and the optimized reaction barrier, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity.

Herein, atomically dispersed Fe and Co anchored on nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon hollow nanorod structures (FeCo-NPC) are rationally designed and synthesized. The as-prepared FeCo-NPC catalyst exhibits significantly boosted electrocatalytic kinetics and greatly upshifts the half-wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, when utilized as the cathode, the FeCo-NPC catalyst also displays excellent zinc-air battery performance. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the introduction of single Co atoms with Co-N/P coordination around isolated Fe atoms induces asymmetric electron distribution, resulting in the suitable adsorption/desorption ability for oxygen intermediates and the optimized reaction barrier, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Spintronic Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims at discussing the spin&#8208;related performance and functionalities of diverse emerging spintronic material systems. The spin transport/manipulation properties of organic semiconductors, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, and 2D materials are discussed in the first place, respectively. Following, device multifunctionalities based on these materials are discussed, including spin&#8208;filter effect via chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity, spin&#8208;photovoltaic, spin&#8208;light&#8208;emitting, and spin&#8208;transistor functions.








Abstract
The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultrahigh&#8208;speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge&#8208;based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next&#8208;generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multifunctionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and 2D materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfill the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, these promising materials are systematically reviewed for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) are discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) are overviewed, including the spin&#8208;filter effect, spin&#8208;photovoltaics, spin&#8208;light emitting devices, and spin&#8208;transistor functions. Subsequently, challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics are presented.

         <title>Nanomedicine for T&#8208;Cell Mediated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicines provide modular platforms enabling T&#8208;cell immunotherapy enhancement. The impact of different nanomaterials on immunotherapy and the mechanisms involved deserve further study. Nanomedicine&#8208;based combination therapy can enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, but require rational control over site of action and dose. Overall, nanomedicine offers promising solutions to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, which will further advance its clinical application.








Abstract
T&#8208;cell immunotherapy offers outstanding advantages in the treatment of various diseases, and with the selection of appropriate targets, efficient disease treatment can be achieved. T&#8208;cell immunotherapy has made great progress, but clinical results show that only a small proportion of patients can benefit from T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. The extensive mechanistic work outlines a blueprint for using T cells as a new option for immunotherapy, but also presents new challenges, including the balance between different fractions of T cells, the inherent T&#8208;cell suppression patterns in the disease microenvironment, the acquired loss of targets, and the decline of T&#8208;cell viability. The diversity, flexibility, and intelligence of nanomedicines give them great potential for enhancing T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. Here, how T&#8208;cell immunotherapy strategies can be adapted with different nanomaterials to enhance therapeutic efficacy is discussed. For two different pathological states, immunosuppression and immune activation, recent advances in nanomedicines for T&#8208;cell immunotherapy in diseases such as cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes are summarized. With a focus on T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, this review highlights the outstanding advantages of nanomedicines in disease treatment, and helps advance one's understanding of the use of nanotechnology to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Inhibition of Ion Migration for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resultant perovskite solar cells are intrinsically unstable owing to ion migration, which severely impedes performance enhancement, even with device encapsulation. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding of the origin of ion migration and the action of effective inhibition strategies that are essential for the development of &#8220;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#8221; perovskite solar cells with high intrinsic stability to accelerate commercialization.








Abstract
In recent years, organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites are now emerging as the most attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices, due to their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and low manufacturing cost. However, the resultant perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are intrinsically unstable owing to ion migration, which severely impedes performance enhancement, even with device encapsulation. There is no doubt that the investigation of ion migration and the summarization of recent advances in inhibition strategies are necessary to develop &#8220;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#8221; PVSCs with high intrinsic stability for accelerated commercialization. This review systematically elaborates on the generation and fundamental mechanisms of ion migration in PVSCs, the impact of ion migration on hysteresis, phase segregation, and operational stability, and the characterizations for ion migration in PVSCs. Then, many related works on the strategies for inhibiting ion migration toward highly efficient and stable PVSCs are summarized. Finally, the perspectives on the current obstacles and prospective strategies for inhibition of ion migration in PVSCs to boost operational stability and meet all of the requirements for commercialization success are summarized.

         <title>Interdisciplinary&#8208;Inspired Smart Antibacterial Materials and Their Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the recent advances in smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) focusing on their interdisciplinarity. To combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, SAMs are developed by adopting ideas incubated in materials science, physiology, and biomimicry. More interdisciplinary collaborations are expected for the continuous development, promotion, and clinical adoption of SAMs.








Abstract
The discovery of antibiotics has saved millions of lives, but the emergence of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria has become another problem in modern medicine. To avoid or reduce the overuse of antibiotics in antibacterial treatments, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, pathogen&#8208;targeting nanoparticles, immunogenic nano&#8208;toxoids, and biomimetic materials are being developed to make sterilization better and smarter than conventional therapies. The common goal of smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) is to increase the antibiotic efficacy or function via an antibacterial mechanism different from that of antibiotics in order to increase the antibacterial and biological properties while reducing the risk of drug resistance. The research and development of SAMs are increasingly interdisciplinary because new designs require the knowledge of different fields and input/collaboration from scientists in different fields. A good understanding of energy conversion in materials, physiological characteristics in cells and bacteria, and bactericidal structures and components in nature are expected to promote the development of SAMs. In this review, the importance of multidisciplinary insights for SAMs is emphasized, and the latest advances in SAMs are categorized and discussed according to the pertinent disciplines including materials science, physiology, and biomimicry.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Engineering Efficient CAR&#8208;T Cells via Electroactive Nanoinjection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non&#8208;viral, low&#8208;voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell&#8208;based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR&#8208;T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral&#8208;based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non&#8208;viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co&#8208;culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI&#8208;transfected CAR&#8208;T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells. Given the growing potential of cell&#8208;based immunotherapies, such a platform holds great promise for ex vivo cell engineering, especially in CAR&#8208;T cell therapy.

The engineered ENI platform provides a non-viral, low-voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti-lymphoma CAR-T cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell-based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR-T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral-based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non-viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&amp;gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co-culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI-transfected CAR-T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti-lymphoma CAR-T cells. Given the growing potential of cell-based immunotherapies, such a platform holds great promise for ex vivo cell engineering, especially in CAR-T cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+&#8208;diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, and V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic-migration energy barrier and ideal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher-valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high-rate capability and long-duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material-level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>

It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing&#8208;Enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>

A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Achieving a Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping a Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;doping of magnetic Mn2+ ions in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal can regulate the emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons under high&#8208;energy ray excitation, solving its drawback of slow scintillation decay. This optimization makes the crystal an ideal scintillator for ultrafast, ultrabright, and low&#8208;cost scintillation with significant application prospects.








Abstract
An ultrabright, ultrafast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and is sorely desired in scintillation detection, but has hitherto not been found. Here, a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultrahigh light yield (&#8776;95&#8239;772 photons&#160;per&#160;MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;rays), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;keV), and ultrafast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%) is reported. In mechanism, it is found that micro&#8208;doping of a heterovalent magnetic ion (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;trapped excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8776;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming the slow decay into an ultrafast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times&#160;to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#8208;based cathode&#160;with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD&#8208;COF//AQ all&#8208;organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.








Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR&#8208;Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack-onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY-C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY-C4-based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3-based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY-C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high-performance flexible OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub&#8208;nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high&#8208;speed operation in random&#8208;access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase&#8208;field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non&#8208;equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high&#8208;speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA&#8208;loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;Like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on rational design and selection of fluorophores and phase&#8208;change molecules to construct color&#8208;independent thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) with ultrasensitive thermoresponsive fluorescence switching, high brightness, and superior reversibility and stability to the heating&#8211;cooling cycle is reported. By using these TFMs, a thermo&#8208;controllable multilevel information encryption/decryption is achieved within 10&#160;K temperature change.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8211;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption is proposed, which employs polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8211;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase&#8208;change molecules are systematically studied. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibit over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80%&#160;K&#8722;1, which are first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs can be further developed as information&#8208;storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switching&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

     alt="Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid-like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid-like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid-like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials
In article number 2305472, Xiaobo Zhou, Yuling Qin, Li Wu, and co&#8208;workers present a comprehensive approach for the development of highly sensitive thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) suitable for multilevel information encryption. They employ polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with D&#8211;A&#8211;D type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrices. Thanks to this well&#8208;designed strategy, the resulting TFMs exhibit remarkable fluorescence enhancements within relatively narrow range of temperature variations.

Circularly Polarized Luminescence
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is the emission of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical light, and a key property of certain chiral materials with applications such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. In article number 2302279 by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers, the fundamentals, advances, pitfalls and software for accurately measuring CPL are described.

Extracellular Vesicles
Extracellular vesicles have emerged as therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. However, current techniques for their isolation are relatively inefficient. In article number 2212000, Jean&#8208;Christophe Leroux and co&#8208;workers report the development of a novel electrochemical device with affinity&#8208;based capturing for the rapid isolation of extracellular vesicles from biosamples and their further purification after loading with exogenous compounds.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Recent Progress and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) as emerging carbon nanomaterials have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In this review,&#160;we&#160;focus on the optical properties of CDs based on their structural design and recent trends in electroluminescent LED applications.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs, and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs is presented, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications, and to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, it is concluded with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. It is hoped that this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.
