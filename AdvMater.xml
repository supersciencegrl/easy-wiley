         <title>Graphene&#8208;Perovskite Fibre Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and photodetectors (PDs), into wearables and textiles is of great interest for applications such as healthcare and physiological monitoring. These require flexible/wearable systems adaptable to body motions, thus materials conformable to non&#8208;planar surfaces, and able to maintain performance under mechanical distortions. Here, we&#160;prepare fibre PDs combining rolled graphene layers and photoactive perovskites. Conductive fibres (&#8764;500 &#937;/cm) are made by rolling single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) around silica fibres, followed by deposition of a dielectric layer (Al2O3 and parylene C), another rolled SLG as a channel, and perovskite as photoactive component. The resulting gate&#8208;tunable PD has a response time&#8764;9ms, with an external responsivity&#8764;22kA/W at 488nm for a 1V bias. The external responsivity is two orders of magnitude higher, and the response time one order of magnitude faster, than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable fibre&#8208;based PDs. Under bending at 4mm radius, up to&#8764;80% photocurrent is maintained. Washability tests show&#8764;72% of initial photocurrent after 30 cycles, promising for wearable&#160;applications.

         <title>Augmented Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution by d&#8208;p Orbital Electron Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), and high&#8208;entropy hydroxides (HEHs), have been advanced as a novel frontier in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, their inherent activity deficiency poses a major challenge. To achieve the unlimited goal to tailor the structure&#8208;activity relationship in multicomponent systems, entropy&#8208;driven composition engineering presents substantial potential, by fabricating high&#8208;entropy anion&#8208;regulated transition metal compounds as sophisticated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Herein, we developed a versatile two&#8208;dimensional high&#8208;entropy metal phosphorus trisulfides (HEPS3) as a promising and adjustable platform. Leveraging the multiple electron&#8208;coupling and d&#8208;p orbital hybridization induced by the cocktail effect, we disclose the exceptional oxygen evolution catalytic activity upon van der Waals material (MnFeCoNiZn)PS3, exhibiting an impressively low overpotential of 240&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a minimal Tafel slope of 32&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and negligible degradation under varying current densities for over 96 hours. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further offer insights into the correlation between orbital hybridization and catalytic performance within high&#8208;entropy systems, underscoring the contribution of active phosphorus centers on the substrate to performance enhancements. Moreover, by achieving electron redistribution to optimize the electron coordination environment, this work presents an effective strategy for advanced catalysts in energy&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Heterointerfaces: Unlocking Superior Capacity and Rapid Mass Transfer Dynamics in Energy Storage Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heterogeneous electrode materials possess abundant heterointerfaces with a localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;, which enhances capacity output and accelerates mass/charge transfer dynamics in energy storage devices. These promising features open new possibilities for demanding applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage, and portable electronics. However, the fundamental principles and working mechanisms that govern heterointerfaces are not yet fully understood, impeding the rational design of electrode materials. In this study, we systematically discuss the heterointerface evolution during charging and discharging process as well as the intricate interaction between heterointerfaces and charge/mass transport phenomena. We also provide guidelines along with feasible strategies for engineering structural heterointerfaces to address specific challenges encountered in various application scenarios. This review offers innovative solutions for the development of heterogeneous electrode materials, enabling more efficient energy storage beyond conventional electrochemistry. Furthermore, it provides fresh insights into the advancement of clean energy conversion and storage technologies. This review contributes to the knowledge and understanding of heterointerfaces, paving the way for the design and optimization of next&#8208;generation energy storage materials for a sustainable future.

         <title>Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles Embedded in Dual&#8208;Layered Hydrogel for Programmed ROS Regulation and Comprehensive Tissue Regeneration in Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Burn wounds often bring high risks of delayed healing process and even death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in burn wound repair. However, the dynamic process in wound healing requires both the generation of ROS to inhibit bacteria and the subsequent reduction of ROS levels to initiate and promote tissue regeneration, which calls for a more intelligent ROS regulation dressing system. Hence, a dual&#8208;layered hydrogel (Dual&#8208;Gel) tailored to the process of burn wound repair is designed: the inner layer hydrogel (Gel 2) first responds to bacterial hyaluronidase (Hyal) to deliver aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) functionalized adipose&#8208;derived stem cell nanovesicles, which generate ROS upon light irradiation to eliminate bacteria; then the outer layer hydrogel (Gel 1) continuously starts a long&#8208;lasting consumption of excess ROS at the wound site to accelerate tissue regeneration. Simultaneously, the stem cell nanovesicles trapped in the burns wound also provide nutrients and mobilize neighboring tissues to thoroughly assist in inflammation regulation, cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. In summary, this study develops an intelligent treatment approach on burn wounds by programmatically regulating ROS and facilitating comprehensive wound tissue repair.

         <title>Adaptive Processing Enabled by Sodium Alginate based Complementary Memristor for Neuromorphic Sensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adaptive processing allows sensory systems to autonomically adjust their sensitivity with exposure to a constant sensory stimulus and thus organisms to adapt to environmental variations. Bioinspired&#160;electronics with adaptive functions are highly desirable for the development of neuromorphic sensory systems (NSSs). Herein, the functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity (i.e., Weber's law), as two fundamental cues of sensory adaptation, are biorealistically demonstrated in an Ag nanowire&#8208;embedded sodium alginate based complementary memristor. In particular, Weber's law is experimentally emulated in a single complementary memristor. Furthermore, three types of adaptive NSS unit are constructed to realize a multiple perceptual capability that processes the stimuli of illuminance, temperature, and pressure signals. Taking neuromorphic vision as an example, scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are well reproduced for image enhancement against dark and bright backgrounds. Importantly, an NSS system with multisensory integration function is demonstrated by combining light and pressure spikes, where the accuracy of pattern recognition is obviously enhanced relative to that of an individual sense. Our work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic electronics with adaptive functions and paves the way toward developing a highly efficient NSS.

         <title>Active Fabrics with Controllable Stiffness for Robotic Assistive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives. However, existing assistive fabrics actuated by fluidic or thermal stimuli struggle to adapt to complex body contours and are hindered by challenges such as large volumes after actuation and slow response rates. To overcome these limitations, we draw inspiration from biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, and propose active assistive fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers. Through programmable tessellation of target body shapes into architectured tiles and controlling their interactions by the actuated fibers, our active fabrics can rapidly (within seconds) transition between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&amp;gt; 350 times stiffness change, loading capacity to weight ratio &amp;gt; 50) while minimizing the device volume after actuation. We demonstrate the versatility of our active fabrics as exosuits for tremor suppression and lifting assistance. We also present its potential as body armors for impact mitigation. Electrothermal actuators are integrated for smart actuation with convenient folding capabilities.

         <title>Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endothermic charge separation is found to occur spontaneously in a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA)&#8208;based bulk heterostructure (PM6:Y6), which can be driven by entropy. This process can produce free carriers even with a small interfacial energy level offset, which can contribute to the high performance found in recent NFA organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction is probed by time&#8208;resolved two&#8208;photon photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point&#8208;like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.

         <title>Structurally Tunable Donor&#8722;Bridge&#8722;Fluorophore Architecture Enables Highly Efficient and Concentration&#8208;Independent Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.








Abstract
Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent MR&#8208;TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs. Here, by systematic arrangement of donor triphenylamine and fluorophore BNCz on distinct bridges, a spatial confinement strategy has been developed with a donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture. Structurally fine modulation and progressive evolution to construct molecular entities with congested steric hindrance effect that can suppress intermolecular interactions without substantially affecting the luminescence tone of fluorophore BNCz, resulting in highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent narrowband emitters; through isomer engineering, two isomers BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA and TPA&#8208;PCz&#8208;BN with different crystal stacking patterns are synthesized by altering the connection mode between triphenylamine and BNCz. As a result, BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based device showcases maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.3% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 27 nm at 10 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 32.5% and the emission spectrum is almost unchanged.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25% Efficiency and High Stability Enabled by Crystallization Modulation and Holistic Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles with good dispersion in perovskite inks are facilely synthesized. The addition of these NPs into perovskite inks can effectively facilitate charge extraction and passivate the defects in the holistic perovskite films. The air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells based on indene&#8208;C60 biadduct nanoparticles realize a high power conversion efficiency of 25.1% and improved stability.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (e.g., PCBM and IDIC) frequently serve as interface passivants for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their beneficial passivation effects on perovskite interfaces. However, their passivation to the interiors of perovskite films is greatly limited by their poor solubility in polar solvents and compatibility issues. Here the facile synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) passivants that readily disperse in perovskite inks is reported. Adding these NPs into perovskite inks not only modulates perovskite crystallization, improves film quality and conductivity, but also achieves holistic bulk film passivation. Consequently, blade&#8208;coated p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ICBA NPs achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.1% (independently certified as 25.0%), the highest reported value for air&#8208;processed PSCs irrespective of fabrication methods or device structures. This work develops a novel approach for effective and holistic perovskite passivation by converting conventional passivants to perovskite&#8208;compatible NPs, paving the way for more efficient and stable perovskite solar devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The intercalation of layered materials offers a flexible approach for tailoring their structures and generating unexpected properties. In this review, we provide perspectives on the chemical intercalation of layered materials, including graphite/graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and some particular materials. The characteristics of the different intercalation methods and their chemical mechanisms are discussed. The influence of intercalation on the structural changes of the host materials and the structural change how to affect the intrinsic properties of the intercalation compounds are discussed. Furthermore, we provide a perspective on the applications of intercalation compounds in fields such as energy conversion and storage, catalysis, smart devices, biomedical applications, and environmental remediation. Finally, we provide brief insights into the challenges and future opportunities for the chemical intercalation of layered materials.

Abstract
Anatomizing mixed&#8208;phases, referring to analyzing the mixing profiles and quantifying the phases&#8217; proportions in a material, which is of great significance in the genuine applications. Here, by using SHG polarimetry and PFM techniques, we elucidated the contributions and distributions of two different symmetric phases mixed in an archetype monoaxial molecular ferroelectric, diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPACl). The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and we evidenced the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. Our research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.

         <title>Field&#8208;effect Thermoelectric Hotspot in Monolayer Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene is a promising candidate for the thermal management of downscaled microelectronic devices owing to its exceptional electrical and thermal properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate electrical and thermal interconversions at a nanoscale, particularly in field&#8208;effect transistors with prevalent gate operations, remains elusive. In this study, nanothermometric imaging is employed to examine a current&#8208;carrying monolayer graphene channel sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics. We reveal for the first time that beyond the expected Joule heating, the thermoelectric Peltier effect actively plays a significant role in generating hotspots beneath the gated region. With gate&#8208;controlled charge redistribution and a shift in the Dirac point position, we demonstrate an unprecedented systematic evolution of thermoelectric hotspots, underscoring their remarkable tunability. Our study reveals the field&#8208;effect Peltier contribution in a single graphene&#8208;material channel of transistors, offering valuable insights into field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics and future on&#8208;chip energy management.

         <title>Targeted SERS Imaging and Intraoperative Real&#8208;Time Elimination of Microscopic Tumors for Improved Breast&#8208;Conserving Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Breast&#8208;conserving surgery is the favorable option for breast cancer patients owing to its advantages of less aggressiveness and better cosmetic outcomes over mastectomy. However, it often suffers from post&#8208;surgical lethal recurrence due to the incomplete removal of microscopic tumors. Here, we report a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surgical strategy for precise delineation of tumor margins and intraoperative real&#8208;time elimination of microscopic tumor foci, which is capable of complete surgical removal of breast tumors and significantly improve the outcomes of breast&#8208;conserving surgery without local tumor recurrence. Our technique is chiefly based on the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeting SERS probes with integrated multifunctionalities of ultrahigh sensitive detection, significant HER2 expression suppression, cell proliferation inhibition, and superior photothermal ablation. In a HER2+ breast tumor mouse model, we demonstrate the remarkable capability of our SERS surgical strategy for complete removal of HER2+ breast tumors through SERS&#8208;guided surgical resection and intraoperative real&#8208;time photothermal elimination. Our results show complete eradiation of HER2+ breast tumors without local recurrence, consequently delivering a 100% tumor&#8208;free survival. Expectedly, this SERS surgical strategy holds great promise for clinical treatment of HER2+ breast cancer with improved patients&#8217; survival.

&lt;p&gt;Breast-conserving surgery is the favorable option for breast cancer patients owing to its advantages of less aggressiveness and better cosmetic outcomes over mastectomy.

         <title>Engineering an Organic Nanoplatform for Augmented Pyroeletroimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photothermal immunotherapy has shown great promise in the treatment of tumor metastasis. However, the thermal resistance of tumor cells substantially compromises the treatment effect of photothermal immunotherapy. Herein, a high&#8208;performance organic pyroelectric nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 nanoparticles (NPs), was rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. Biocompatible tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs with excellent pyroelectric and photothermal conversion properties were constructed by assembling organic, low&#8208;bandgap pyroelectric molecules with amphiphilic polymers. After internalization by tumor cells, treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs caused an apparent temperature elevation upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, inducing potent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Additionally, the temperature variations under alternating NIR laser irradiation facilitated reactive oxygen species production for pyroelectric therapy, thus promoting ICD activation and lowering thermal resistance. Importantly, in vivo assessments illustrated that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs in combination with NIR laser exposure notably inhibited primary and distant tumor proliferation and prominently retarded lung metastasis. RNA profiling revealed that treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs markedly suppressed metastasis under NIR laser illumination by downregulating metastasis&#8208;related genes and upregulating immune response&#8208;associated pathways. Therefore, this study provides a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis, thereby overcoming the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Innovative Formulation Platform: Paving the Way for Superior Protein Therapeutics with Enhanced Efficacy and Broadened Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer high therapeutic potency and specificity, the broader adoptions and development of protein therapeutics, however, have been constricted by their intrinsic limitations such as inadequate stability, immunogenicity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and off&#8208;target effects. This review describes a platform technology that formulates individual protein molecules with a thin formulation layer of crosslinked polymers, which confers the protein therapeutics with high activity, enhanced stability, controlled release capability, reduced immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and ability to cross the blood brain barriers. Based on currently approved protein therapeutics, this formulating platform affords the development of a vast family of superior protein therapeutics with improved efficacy and broadened indications at significantly reduced cost.

         <title>Enhanced Ocular Delivery of Beva via Ultra&#8208;Small Polymeric Micelles for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pathological ocular neovascularization resulting from retinal ischemia constitutes a major cause of vision loss. Current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies rely on burdensome intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (Beva). Herein ultrasmall polymeric micelles encapsulating Beva (P@Beva) are developed for noninvasive topical delivery to posterior eye tissues. Beva is efficiently loaded into 11&#160;nm micelles fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of hyperbranched amphiphilic copolymers. The neutral, brush&#8208;like micelles demonstrate excellent drug encapsulation and colloidal stability. In vitro, P@Beva enhances intracellular delivery of Beva in ocular cells versus free drug. Ex vivo corneal and conjunctival&#8208;sclera&#8208;choroidal tissues transport after eye drops are improved 23&#8208;fold and 7.9&#8208;fold, respectively. Anti&#8208;angiogenic bioactivity is retained with P@Beva eliciting greater inhibition of endothelial tube formation and choroid sprouting over Beva alone. Remarkably, in an oxygen&#8208;induced retinopathy (OIR) model, topical P@Beva matching efficacy of intravitreal Beva injection, the clinical standard. Comprehensive biocompatibility verifies safety. Overall, this pioneering protein delivery platform holds promise to shift paradigms from invasive intravitreal injections towards simplified, noninvasive administration of biotherapeutics targeting posterior eye diseases.

         <title>Fast Photoactuation and Environmental Response of Humidity&#8208;Sensitive pDAP&#8208;Silicon Nanocantilevers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocantilevers are made using FIB milling on plasma pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanomembranes. Photoactuation originates in reversible sorption of atmospheric water vapor by the responsive pDAP layer. Rapid photothermal heating leads to the pDAP contraction and cantilever deflection within ms timescales. The straightening is spontaneous, albeit fast, due to the efficient heat dissipation through Si, leading to water absorption and pDAP expansion.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes are a new class of advanced materials that can be harnessed in complex architectures for micro and nano&#8208;manipulators, artificial muscles, energy harvesting, soft robotics, and sensors. The design and fabrication of responsive membranes must meet such challenges as trade&#8208;offs between responsiveness and mechanical durability, volumetric low&#8208;cost production ensuring low environmental impact, and compatibility with standard technologies or biological systems This work demonstrates the fabrication of multi&#8208;responsive, mechanically robust poly(1,3&#8208;diaminopropane) (pDAP) nanomembranes and their application in fast photoactuators. The pDAP films are developed using a plasma&#8208;assisted polymerization technique that offers large&#8208;scale production and versatility of potential industrial relevance. The pDAP layers exhibit high elasticity with the Young's modulus of &#8776;7 GPa and remarkable mechanical durability across 20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C temperatures. Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light&#8208;to&#8208;motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.

Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP-coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi-responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light-to-motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protocell Flow Reactors for Enzyme and Whole&#8208;Cell Mediated Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocell continuous flow reactors consisting of a densely packed array of enzyme&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;containing membranized coacervate vesicles are constructed and used for the spatiotemporal processing of biochemical and whole&#8208;cell mediated catalysis. The engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents offers opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.








Abstract
The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction&#8208;diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions, and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors can offer new opportunities in reactor design and application. Herein, the fabrication of protocell&#8208;based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole&#8208;cell mediated biocatalysis is demonstrated. Semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles are employed as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single&#8208; or multiple&#8208;step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria&#8208;containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme&#8208;mediated L&#8208;DOPA synthesis, and whole&#8208;cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions, is demonstrated. It is shown that the protocell&#8208;nested enzymes and bacterial cells exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non&#8208;encapsulated counterparts. These results provide a step toward the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.

         <title>Treefrog&#8208;Inspired Flexible Electrode with High Permeability, Stable Adhesion, and Robust Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of instable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability that hinder the long&#8208;term application of in vitro bioelectrodes. Inspired by treefrog web and bird's beak, through the optimization design, a web&#8208;like electrode, which can solve these complex integrated challenges, is proposed. Proposed electrode has the most balanced mechanical, electrical, and electrode properties of typical electrodes reported in recent years.









Abstract
Long&#8208;term continuous monitoring (LTCM) of physiological electrical signals is an effective means for detecting several cardiovascular diseases. However, the integrated challenges of stable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability under different skin conditions significantly hinder the application of flexible electrodes in LTCM. This paper proposes a structured electrode inspired by the treefrog web, comprising dispersed pillars at the bottom and asymmetric cone holes at the top. Attachment structures with a dispersed pillar improve the contact stability (adhesion increases 2.79/13.16 times in dry/wet conditions compared to an electrode without structure). Improved permeable duct structure provides high permeability (12 times compared to cotton). Due to high adhesion and permeability, the electrode's durability is 40 times larger than commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The treefrog web&#8208;like electrode has great advantages in permeability, adhesion, and durability, resulting in prospects for application in physiological electrical signal detection and a new design idea for LTCM wearable dry electrodes.

         <title>Fast transfer of triplet to doublet excitons from organometallic host to organic radical semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spin triplet exciton formation sets limits on technologies using organic semiconductors that are confined to singlet&#8208;triplet photophysics. In contrast, excitations in the spin doublet manifold in organic radical semiconductors can show efficient luminescence. Here we explore the dynamics of the spin allowed process of intermolecular energy transfer from triplet to doublet excitons. We employ a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA&#8208;CF3) as a model triplet donor host, since following photoexcitation it undergoes extremely fast intersystem crossing to set up a population of triplet excitons within 4&#160;ps. This enables a foundational study for tracking energy transfer from triplets to a model radical semiconductor, TTM&#8208;3PCz. Over 74% of all radical luminescence originates from the triplet channel in this system under photoexcitation. We find that intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;doublet energy transfer can occur directly and rapidly, with 12% of triplet excitons transferring already on sub&#8208;ns timescales. This enhanced triplet harvesting mechanism is utilised in efficient near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which can be extended to other opto&#8208;electronic and &#8208;spintronic technologies by radical&#8208;based spin control in molecular semiconductors.

         <title>Coupling Anti&#8208;Site Defect and Lattice Tensile Stimulates Facile Isotropic Li&#8208;ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite widely used as a commercial cathode, the anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional channel hopping of lithium ions along the [010] direction in LiFePO4 prevent its application in fast charging conditions. Herein, we employ an ultra&#8208;fast non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) technology to controllably introduce the Li&#8208;Fe anti&#8208;site defects and tensile strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. This design makes the study of the effect of the strain field on the performance further extended from the theoretical calculation to the experimental perspective. The existence of Li&#8208;Fe anti&#8208;site defects makes it feasible for Li+ to move from the 4a site of the edge&#8208;sharing octahedra across the ab plane to 4c site of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, producing a new diffusion channel different from [010]. Meanwhile, the presence of a tensile strain field reduces the energy barrier of the new two&#8208;dimensional diffusion path. In the combination of electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, we demonstrate that the unique multi&#8208;scale coupling structure of Li&#8208;Fe anti&#8208;site defects and lattice strain promotes isotropic two&#8208;dimensional inter&#8208;channel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability (high&#8208;capacity retention of 84.4% after 2000 cycles at 10 C). The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multi&#8208;scale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Rational Design of Si&#9472;Rhodamine as Cathepsin&#8208;pH&#8208;Activated Probe for Accurate Fluorescence Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of machine learning has dramatically revolutionized the process of material discovery. Here, the desired xanthene dyes are rational designed through machine learning and dual&#8208;locked probe for precise imaging of complex hepatocellular carcinoma is constructed. These results not only affirm the validity of the model but also guide the design of novel probes with practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance fluorescent probes stand as indispensable tools in fluorescence&#8208;guided imaging, and are crucial for precise delineation of focal tissue while minimizing unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. Herein, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted strategy to investigate the current available xanthene dyes is first proposed, and a quantitative prediction model to guide the rational synthesis of novel fluorescent molecules with the desired pH responsivity is constructed. Two novel Si&#9472;rhodamine derivatives are successfully achieved and the cathepsin/pH sequentially activated probe Si&#9472;rhodamine&#9472;cathepsin&#8208;pH (SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH) is constructed. The results reveal that SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH exhibits higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of fluorescence imaging, compared to single pH or cathepsin&#8208;activated probe. Moreover, SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH shows strong differentiation abilities for tumor cells and tissues and accurately discriminates the complex hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from normal ones, indicating its significant application potential in clinical practice. Therefore, the continuous development of xanthene dyes and the rational design of superior fluorescent molecules through machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted model broaden the path and provide more advanced methods to researchers.

         <title>3D Intelligent Cloaked Vehicle Equipped with Thousand&#8208;Level Reconfigurable Full&#8208;Polarization Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D full&#8208;polarization cloaking system is proposed and the in situ dynamic invisibility is realized using a travelling vehicle. The cloaking system integrates with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution operation loop, which mainly contains external sensors, high&#8208;performance metasurfaces, and hybrid inverse optimization strategy. Experiment results verifies its performance which yields a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%.








Abstract
A crucial aspect in shielding a variety of advanced electronic devices from electromagnetic detection involves controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves, akin to invisibility cloaks. Decades ago, the exploration of transformation optics heralded the dawn of modern invisibility cloaks, which has stimulated immense interest across various physical scenarios. However, most prior research is simplified to low&#8208;dimensional and stationary hidden objects, limiting their practical applicability in a dynamically changing world. This study develops a 3D large&#8208;scale intelligent cloak capable of remaining undetectable even in non&#8208;stationary conditions. By employing thousand&#8208;level reconfigurable full&#8208;polarization metasurfaces, this work has achieved an exceptionally high degree of freedom in sculpting the scattering waves as desired. Serving as the core computational unit, a hybrid inverse design enables the cloaked vehicle to respond in real&#8208;time, with a rapid reaction time of just 70&#160;ms. These experiments integrate the cloaked vehicle with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution system and evaluate its performance under random static positions and dynamic travelling trajectories, achieving a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%. These findings establish a general paradigm for the next generation of intelligent meta&#8208;devices in real&#8208;world settings, potentially paving the way for an era of &#8220;Electromagnetic Internet of Things.&#8221;

         <title>Adhesive Zwitterionic Poly(ionic liquid) with Unprecedented Organic Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) adhesive, known for its exceptional resistance to organic solvents and recyclability. Utilizing electrostatic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, ZPIL maintains strong adhesion across various substrates and withstands prolonged exposure to organic solvents. This breakthrough addresses key challenges in adhesive technology, offering significant potential for industrial applications in plastics, coatings, and adhesives.








Abstract
The resistance of adhesives to organic solvents is of paramount importance in diverse industries. Unfortunately, many currently available adhesives exhibit either weak intermolecular chain interactions, resulting in insufficient resistance to organic solvents, or possess a permanent covalent crosslinked network, impeding recyclability. This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by formulating zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) derivatives with robust dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, incorporating sulfonic anions and imidazolium cations. Due to its unique dynamic and electrostatic self&#8208;crosslinking structure, the ZPIL exhibits significant adhesion to various substrates and demonstrates excellent recyclability even after multiple adhesion tests. Significantly, ZPIL exhibits exceptional adhesion stability across diverse nonpolar and polar organic solvents, including ionic liquids, distinguishing itself from nonionic polymers and conventional poly(ionic liquid)s. Its adhesive performance remains minimally affected even after prolonged exposure to soaking conditions. The study presents a promising solution for the design of highly organic solvent&#8208;resistant materials for plastics, coatings, and adhesives.

         <title>Eagle&#8208;Eye Inspired Meta&#8208;Device for Phase Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dual&#8208;focus vision observed in eagles' eyes is an intriguing phenomenon that has long captivated scientists. Inspired by this natural occurrence, our research introduces a novel bifocal meta&#8208;device incorporating a polarized camera capable of simultaneously capturing images for two different polarizations with slightly different focal distances. This innovative approach facilitates the concurrent acquisition of underfocused and overfocused images in a single snapshot, enabling the effective extraction of quantitative phase information from the object using the transport of intensity equation. Experimental demonstrations showcase the application of quantitative phase imaging to artificial objects and human embryonic kidney cells, particularly emphasizing the meta&#8208;device's relevance in dynamic scenarios such as laser&#8208;induced ablation in human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, it provides a solution for the quantification during the dynamic process at the cellular level. Notably, the proposed eagle&#8208;eye inspired meta&#8208;device for phase imaging (EIMPI), due to its simplicity and compact nature, holds promise for significant applications in fields such as endoscopy and headsets, where a lightweight and compact setup is essential.

         <title>Large Language Model&#8208;Based AI Agent for Organic Semiconductor Devices Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention recently, however, their application in specialized scientific fields still requires deep adaptation. In this work, we designed an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for organic field effect transistors (OFETs) by integrating the GPT&#8208;4 model with well&#8208;trained machine learning (ML) algorithms. It can efficiently extract the experimental parameters of OFETs from scientific literature and reshape them into a structured database, achieving precision and recall rates both exceeding 92%. Combined with well&#8208;trained ML models, this AI agent can further provide targeted guidance and suggestions for device design. With prompt engineering and human&#8208;in&#8208;loop strategies, the agent extracted sufficient information of 709 OFETs from 277 research articles across different publishers and gathered them into a standardized database containing more than 10000 device parameters. Using this database, we trained a ML model based on XGBoost for device performance judgment. Combined with the interpretation of the high&#8208;precision model, the agent has provided a feasible optimization scheme that has tripled the charge transport properties of DP&#8208;DTT OFETs. Our work is an effective practice of LLMs in the field of organic optoelectronic devices and expands the research paradigm of organic optoelectronic materials and devices.

         <title>Synergistic Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery of Nanoporous Inorganic Crystals as Non&#8208;Absorbable Oral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has taken drug discovery to new heights, where effective ML training requires vast quantities of high&#8208;quality experimental data as input. Non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs) have unique safety advantage for chronic diseases due to their zero systemic exposure, but their empirical discovery is still time&#8208;consuming and costly. Here, a synergistic ML method, integrating small data&#8208;driven multi&#8208;layer unsupervised learning, in silico quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, and minimal wet&#8208;lab experiments was devised to identify the finest NODs from massive inorganic materials to achieve multi&#8208;objective function (high selectivity, large capacity and stability). Based on this method, a NH4&#8208;form nanoporous zeolite with MER framework (NH4&#8208;MER) was discovered for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In 3 different animal models, NH4&#8208;MER showed a superior safety and efficacy profile in reducing blood K+ without Na+ release, which is an unmet clinical need in chronic kidney disease and Gordon's syndrome. Our work provides a synergistic ML method to accelerate the discovery of NODs and other shape&#8208;selective materials.

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) has taken drug discovery to new heights, where effective ML training requires vast quantities of high-quality experimental data as input. Non-absorbable oral drugs (NODs) have unique safety advantage for chronic diseases due to their zero systemic exposure, but their empirical discovery is still time-consuming and costly. Here, a synergistic ML method, integrating small data-driven multi-layer unsupervised learning, in silico quantum-mechanical computations, and minimal wet-lab experiments was devised to identify the finest NODs from massive inorganic materials to achieve multi-objective function (high selectivity, large capacity and stability). Based on this method, a NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-form nanoporous zeolite with MER framework (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MER) was discovered for the treatment of hyperkalemia.

         <title>Dual&#8208;adaptive Heterojunction Synaptic Transistors for Efficient Machine Vision in Harsh Lighting Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photo&#8208;adaptive synaptic devices enable in&#8208;sensor processing of complex illumination scenes, while second&#8208;order adaptive synaptic plasticity improves learning efficiency by modifying the learning rate in a given environment. The integration of above adaptations in one phototransistor device will provide opportunities for developing high&#8208;efficient machine vision system. Here, we report a dually adaptable organic heterojunction transistor as a working unit in the system, which facilitates precise contrast enhancement and improves convergence rate under harsh lighting conditions. The photo&#8208;adaptive threshold sliding originated from the bidirectional photoconductivity caused by the light intensity&#8208;dependent photogating effect. Metaplasticity is successfully implemented owing to the combination of ambipolar behavior and charge trapping effect. By utilizing the transistor array in a machine vision system, the details and edges can be highlighted in the 0.4% low&#8208;contrast images, and a high recognition accuracy of 93.8% with a significantly promoted convergence rate by about 5 times were also achieved. These results open a strategy to fully implement metaplasticity in optoelectronic devices and suggest their vision processing applications in complex lighting scences.

         <title>Mucus&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogels: A Protective Barrier for Cells against Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mucus is a dynamic biological hydrogel, composed primarily of the glycoprotein mucin, exhibits unique biophysical properties and forms a barrier protecting cells against a broad spectrum of viruses. Here we developed a polyglycerol sulfate&#8208;based dendronized mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer (MICP&#8208;1) with &#8764;10% repeating units of activated disulfide as cross&#8208;linking sites. Cryo&#8208;EM analysis of MICP&#8208;1 reveals an elongated single&#8208;chain fiber morphology. MICP&#8208;1 shows potential inhibitory activity against many viruses such as HSV&#8208;1 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (including variants such as Delta and Omicron). MICP&#8208;1 produces hydrogels with viscoelastic properties similar to healthy human sputum and with tuneable microstructures using linear and branched PEG&#8208;thiol as cross&#8208;linkers. Single particle tracking microrheology, EPR and Cryo&#8208;SEM were used to characterize the network structures. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties, along with viscoelastic properties that are tuneable through reduction. A transwell assay was used to investigate the hydrogel's protective properties against viral infection against HSV&#8208;1. Live&#8208;cell microscopy confirmed that these hydrogels can protect underlying cells from infection by trapping the virus, due to both network morphology and anionic multivalent effects. Overall, our novel mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer generates mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels on a multi&#8208;gram scale. These hydrogels can be used as a models for disulfide&#8208;rich airway mucus research, and as biomaterials.

         <title>Electromechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Stereo Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamic terahertz devices are vital for the next generation of wireless communication, sensing and non&#8208;destructive imaging technologies. Metasurfaces have emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform, offering varied functionalities, miniaturization and simplified fabrication compared to their three&#8208;dimensional counterparts. However, the presence of in&#8208;plane mirror symmetry and reduced degree of freedom imposes fundamental limitations on achieving advanced chiral response, beamforming, and reconfiguration capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate a platform composed of electrically actuated resonators that can be colossally reconfigured between planar and 3D geometries. To illustrate the platform, metadevices with 3D Split Ring Resonators have been fabricated wherein we combine two counteracting driving forces &#8211; (i) folding induced by stress mismatch which enables non&#8208;volatile state design, and (ii) unfolding triggered by the strain associated with insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in VO2, which facilitates volatile structural reconfiguration. This large structural reconfiguration space allows for resonance mode switching, widely tunable magnetic and electric polarizabilities, and increased frequency agility. Moreover, the unique properties of VO2 such as the hysteretic nature of its phase transition is harnessed to demonstrate a multi&#8208;state memory. Therefore, these VO2 integrated metadevices are highly attractive for the realization of 6G communication devices such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, holographic beam formers, and spatial light modulators.

         <title>Millifluidic Nanogenerator Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Device for Blood Electrical Conductivity Monitoring at Low Frequency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrical conductivity of blood is a crucial physiological parameter with diverse applications in medical diagnostics. Here, we introduce a novel approach utilizing a portable millifluidic nanogenerator lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip device for measuring blood conductivity at low frequencies. The proposed device employs blood as a conductive substance within its built&#8208;in triboelectric nanogenerator system. Voltage generated by this blood&#8208;based nanogenerator device is analyzed to determine the electrical conductivity of the blood sample. The self&#8208;powering functionality of the device eliminates the need for complex embedded electronics and external electrodes. Experimental results using simulated body fluid and human blood plasma demonstrate the device's efficacy in detecting variations in conductivity related to changes in electrolyte concentrations. Furthermore, we use artificial intelligence models to analyze the generated voltage patterns and to estimate the blood electrical conductivity. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting conductivity based solely on the device&#8208;generated voltage. The 3D&#8208;printed, disposable design of the device enhances portability and usability, providing a point&#8208;of&#8208;care solution for rapid blood conductivity assessment. A comparative analysis with traditional conductivity measurement methods highlights the advantages of the proposed device in terms of simplicity, portability, and adaptability for various applications beyond blood analysis. Finally, we underscore the importance of overcoming the challenge of measuring blood conductivity at frequencies below 100&#160;Hz using the proposed device for the exploration of fundamental biological processes and the advancement of medical treatments reliant on electrical fields.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms have been identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;based Flame Retardants for Polymers: A Bottom&#8208;up Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review is geared towards elucidating the molecular understanding of the carbon&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms for polymers via holistic characterisation combining detailed analytical assessments and computational material science. The use of carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, which include graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon dots (CDs) and fullerenes, in their pure and functionalised forms are initially reviewed to evaluate their flame retardancy performance and to determine their elevation of the flammability resistance on various types of polymers. The early transition metal carbides such as MXenes, regarded as next generation carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, are discussed with respect to their superior flame retardancy and multifunctional applications. At the core of this review is the utilisation of cutting&#8208;edge molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which sets a precedence of an alternative bottom&#8208;up approach to fill the knowledge gap through insights into the thermal resisting process of the carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, such as the formation of carbonaceous char and intermediate chemical reactions offered by the unique carbon bonding arrangements and microscopic in&#8208;situ architectures. Combining MD simulations with detailed experimental assessments and characterisation, a more targeted development as well as a systematic material synthesis framework can be realised for the future development of advanced flame&#8208;retardant polymers.

         <title>Precisely Constructing Orbital&#8208;Coupled Fe&#8208;Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air/Iodide Hybrid Batteries</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are promising for energy storage and conversion. However, the high charging voltage and low energy efficiency hinder their commercialization. Herein, we address these challenges by employing precisely constructed multifunctional Fe&#8208;Co diatomic site catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DACs) and integrating iodide/iodate redox into ZABs to create Zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries (ZAIHBs) with highly efficient multifunctional catalyst. The strong coupling between the 3d orbitals of Fe and Co weakens the excessively strong binding strength between active sites and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox. Consequently, FeCo&#8208;DACs exhibits outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity with a small potential gap (&#916;E = 0.66&#160;V) and outstanding stability. Moreover, an outstanding catalytic performance towards iodide/iodate redox is obtained. Therefore, FeCo&#8208;DAC&#8208;based ZAIHBs exhibit high energy efficiency of up to 75% at 10&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and excellent cycling stability (72% after 500 hours). This research offers critical insights into the rational design of DACs, and paves the way for high&#8208;energy efficiency energy storage devices.

         <title>Optically Actuated soft Microrobot Family for Single&#8208;cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precisely controlled manipulation of non&#8208;adherent single cells is often a pre&#8208;requisite for their detailed investigation. Optical trapping provides a versatile means for positioning cells with sub&#8208;micrometer precision or measuring forces with femto&#8208;Newton resolution. A variant of the technique, called indirect optical trapping, enables single&#8208;cell manipulation with no photodamage and superior spatial control and stability by relying on optically trapped microtools biochemically bound to the cell. High&#8208;resolution 3D lithography enables us to prepare such cell manipulators with any pre&#8208;defined shape, greatly extending the number of achievable manipulation tasks. Here, we present for the first time a novel family of cell manipulators that are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold cells. This provides a more straightforward approach to indirect optical trapping by avoiding biochemical functionalization for cell attachment, and consequently by enabling the manipulated cells to be released at any time. Using the photoresist Ormocomp, we characterize the deformations achievable with optical forces in the tens of pN range and present three modes of single&#8208;cell manipulation as examples to showcase the possible applications such soft microrobotic tools can offer. The applications described here include cell collection, 3D cell imaging and spatially and temporally controlled cell&#8208;cell interaction.

         <title>Advances in Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics: Flexible Transparent Electrodes and Deformable Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems owing to their superior robustness under repetitive tensile strains and their good compatibility. However, reconciling a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency and a reasonable flexibility is a tremendous challenge. In addition, the development of stretchable OPVs must be accelerated to satisfy the increasing requirements of niche markets for mechanical robustness. Stretchable OPV devices can be classified as either structurally or intrinsically stretchable. This paper reviews recent advances in stretchable OPVs, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices. Initially, we provide an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs. Subsequently, research into flexible and stretchable transparent electrodes that directly affect the performances of stretchable OPVs is summarized and analyzed. Overall, this review aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of highly efficient and deformable active materials, whilst also emphasizing advanced strategies for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility of the active layer, including material design, multi&#8208;component settings, and structural optimization.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs), as a class of zero&#8208;dimensional semiconductor materials, have generated widespread interest due to their adjustable band gap, exceptional color purity, near&#8208;unity quantum yield, and solution&#8208;processability. With decades of dedicated research, the potential applications of quantum dots have garnered significant recognition in both the academic and industrial communities. Furthermore, the related quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) stand out as one of the most promising contenders for the next&#8208;generation display technologies. Although QD&#8208;based color conversion films have been applied to improve the color gamut of existing display technologies, the broader application of QLED devices remains in its nascent stages, facing many challenges on the path to commercialization. This review encapsulates the historical discovery and subsequent research advancements in QD materials and their synthesis methods. Additionally, the working mechanisms and architectural design of QLED prototype devices are discussed. Furthermore, the review surveys the latest advancements of QLED devices within the display industry. The narrative concludes with an examination of the challenges and perspectives for QLED technology in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;&#8220;In&#8208;Situ&#8221; Analysis of the Reactive Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface during Magnesium Corrosion using Cryo&#8208;Atom Probe Tomography</title>

Abstract
The early stages of corrosion occurring at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces controls the evolution of the material's degradation process, yet due to their transient state, their analysis remains a formidable challenge. Here we perform corrosion tests on a MgCa alloy, a candidate material for biodegradable implants using pure water as a model system. The corrosion reaction was suspended by plunge freezing into liquid nitrogen. We studied the evolution of the early&#8208;stage corrosion process on the nanoscale by correlating cryo&#8208;atom probe tomography with transmission&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy. We observed the outward growth of Mg hydroxide and the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer consisting of hydroxides of different compositions, mostly monohydroxide Mg(OH) instead of the expected MgO layer. In addition, Ca partitions to these newly formed hydroxides and oxides. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest a domain of stability for this previously experimental unreported Mg(OH) phase. These new approach and findings advance the understanding of the early stages of magnesium corrosion, and in general reactions and processes at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces, which can further facilitate the development of corrosion&#8208;resistant materials or better control of the biodegradation rate of future implants.

         <title>Gradient Doping Enables an Extraordinary Efficiency in Thermoelectric PbTe1&#8722;xIx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient doping is realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that optimizes zT at each portion of the device under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to homogeneous doping.








Abstract
The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generators that have to be operated under a temperature difference (&#916;T) is mainly determined by material's dimensionless figure of merit (zT). However, maximization of zT at each temperature requires an optimization of carrier concentration (nopt) which strongly depends on the temperature and band parameters. Commonly utilized strategy of chemical doping usually enables a homogeneous carrier concentration throughout the material, leading the maximal zT to be achievable only within a narrow temperature range. In this work, a gradiently doping is successfully realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that correspondingly optimizes zT at each portion of the material under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to that of homogeneous doping. Since directional solidification technique commonly enables gradient dopant concentrations in semiconductors, the resultant gradient carrier concentration is illustrated here as an effective approach for advancing thermoelectrics.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Thermal Runaway Mechanism in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Full Cells of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: The Role of Multidirectional Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the fundamental causes of thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in LiNi0.88Co0.1Al0.02O2/graphite full cells, a significant challenge for the electric vehicle industry. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry, the intermediates that establish a self&#8208;amplifying positive feedback loop are comprehensively identified through multidirectional crosstalk.








Abstract
Crosstalk, the exchange of chemical species between battery electrodes, significantly accelerates thermal runaway (TR) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To date, the understanding of their main mechanisms has centered on single&#8208;directional crosstalk of oxygen (O2) gas from the cathode to the anode, underestimating the exothermic reactions during TR. However, the role of multidirectional crosstalk in steering additional exothermic reactions is yet to be elucidated due to the difficulties of correlative in situ analyses of full cells. Herein, the way in which such crosstalk triggers self&#8208;amplifying feedback is elucidated that dramatically exacerbates TR within enclosed full cells, by employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. These findings reveal that ethylene (C2H4) gas generated at the anode promotes O2 evolution at the cathode. This O2 then returns to the anode, further promoting additional C2H4 formation and creating a self&#8208;amplifying loop, thereby intensifying TR. Furthermore, CO2, traditionally viewed as an extinguishing gas, engages in the crosstalk by interacting with lithium at the anode to form Li2CO3, thereby accelerating TR beyond prior expectations. These insights have led to develop an anode coating that impedes the formation of C2H4 and O2, to effectively mitigate TR.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Touch Surfaces to Prevent Cross&#8208;Contamination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;based antimicrobial door handle cover is developed. It completely inhibits the cross&#8208;contamination of Gram&#8208;positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram&#8208;negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungi (Candida albicans).








Abstract
Infection diseases are a major threat to global public health, with nosocomial infections being of particular concern. In this context, antimicrobial coatings emerge as a promising prophylactic strategy to reduce the transmission of pathogens and control infections. Here, antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination are prepared by incorporating iodine&#8208;loaded UiO&#8208;66 microparticles into a potentially biodegradable polyurethane polymer (Baycusan eco E 1000). These covers incorporate MOF particles that serve as both storage reservoirs and delivery systems for the biocidal iodine. Under realistic touching conditions, the door handle covers completely inhibit the transmission of Gram&#8208;positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram&#8208;negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungi (Candida albicans). The covers remain effective even after undergoing multiple contamination cycles, after being cleaned, and when tinted to improve discretion and usability. Furthermore, as the release of iodine from the door handle covers follow hindered Fickian diffusion, their antimicrobial lifetime is calculated to be as long as approximately two years. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of these antimicrobial door handle covers to prevent cross&#8208;contamination, and underline the efficacy of integrating MOFs into innovative technologies.

         <title>Elevating Charge Transport Layer for Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanostructure of elevated hole transport layer between the perovskite grains is introduced to effectively inhibit ion migration in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, achieving a record operational half&#8208;lifetime of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#65292; respectively.








Abstract
Ion migration is a major factor affecting the long term stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which limits their commercialization potential. The accumulation of excess halide ions at the grain boundaries of perovskite films is a primary cause of ion migration in these devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the channels of ion migrations can be effectively impeded by elevating the hole transport layer between the perovskite grain boundaries, resulting in highly stable perovskite LEDs. The unique structure is achieved by reducing the wettability of the perovskites, which prevents infiltration of the upper hole&#8208;transporting layer into the spaces of perovskite grain boundaries. Consequently, nanosized gaps are formed between the excess halide ions and the hole transport layer, effectively suppressing ion migration. With this structure, perovskite LEDs with operational half&#8208;lifetimes of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 respectively are achieved. These lifetimes surpass those of organic LEDs at high brightness. It is further found that this approach can be extended to various perovskite LEDs, showing great promise for promoting perovskite LEDs toward commercial applications.

         <title>Fluid Unidirectional Transport Induced by Structure and Ambient Elements across Porous Materials: From Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spontaneous or non&#8208;spontaneous unidirectional fluid transport across multi&#8208;dimension can occur under specific structural designs and ambient elements for porous materials. While existing reviews have extensively summarized unidirectional fluid transport on surfaces, there is an absence of literature summarizing fluid's unidirectional transport across porous materials. This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs (surface energy, capillary size, topographic curvature) and ambient elements (underwater, under oil, pressure and solar energy). Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8208;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators. Additionally, we have compiled significant principles and formulas from various studies to offer readers valuable references. Simultaneously, we critically assess potential advantages and challenges in these applications and present our perspectives.

         <title>Thiosalicylic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Coordination Structure of Nickel Center via Thermodynamic Modulation for Aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Uniquely functional nanocomplexes with rich coordination environments are critical in energy storage. However, the construction of structurally versatile nanocomplexes remains challenging. In this study, a nickel&#8208;based complex with structural variations is designed via thermodynamic modulation using a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy. A Ni&#8208;based nanomaterial (NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160) with a large specific surface area is synthesized around the competing coordination of the host and guest molecules that differ in terms of the chemical properties of the O and S elements. Concurrently, the coordination environment of NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160 is investigated via X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The thiol functional groups synergistically induced an electron&#8208;rich Ni structure, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The electrochemical performance of an assembled NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160//Zn@CC battery is shown to improve significantly, with a maximum energy density of 0.54 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 49.49&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study provides a new perspective regarding coordination transformations and offers an idea for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

         <title>Designing Advanced Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Alloys by Controlling the Energy State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous alloys, also known as metallic glasses, exhibit many advanced mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, their energy states can vary over a wide range. However, the energy relaxation kinetics are very complex and composed of various types that are coupled with each other. This makes it challenging to control the energy state precisely and to study the energy&#8208;properties relationship. In this brief review, we introduce the recent progresses on studying the enthalpy relaxation kinetics during isothermal annealing, e.g. the observation of two&#8208;step relaxation phenomenon, the detection of relaxation unit (relaxun), the key role of large activation entropy in triggering memory effect, the influence of glass energy state on nanocrystallization. Based on the above knowledge, a new strategy is proposed to design a series of amorphous alloys and their composites consisting of nanocrystals and glass matrix with superior functional properties by precisely controlling the nonequilibrium energy states. As the typical examples, Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with both advanced soft magnetism and good plasticity, Gd&#8208;based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites with large magnetocaloric effect, and Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with high catalytic performance are specifically described.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Copper on Unconventional Phase Metal Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Tandem CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper (Cu) nanomaterials are a unique kind of electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon production in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which holds enormous potential in attaining carbon neutrality. However, phase engineering of Cu nanomaterials remains challenging, especially for the construction of unconventional phase Cu&#8208;based asymmetric heteronanostructures. Here we report the site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase gold (Au) nanorods, obtaining three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu heteronanostructures. Significantly, the resultant fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu Janus nanostructures (JNSs) break the symmetric growth mode of Cu on Au. In electrocatalytic CO2RR, the fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu JNSs exhibit excellent performance in both H&#8208;type and flow cells, with Faradaic efficiencies of 55.5% and 84.3% for ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products, respectively. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8208;Cu JNSs diversifies the CO* adsorption configurations and promotes the CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8208;C coupling towards ethylene generation with reduced energy barriers.

         <title>Bioinspired Superhydrophobic All&#8208;in&#8208;one Coating for Adaptive Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of scalable and passive coatings that can adapt to seasonal temperature changes while maintaining superhydrophobic self&#8208;cleaning functions is crucial for their practical applications. However, the incorporation of passive cooling and heating functions with conflicting optical properties in a superhydrophobic coating is still challenging. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating inspired by the hierarchical structure of a lotus leaf that combines surface wettability, optical structure, and temperature self&#8208;adaptation is obtained through a simple one&#8208;step phase separation process. This coating exhibits an asymmetrical gradient structure with surface&#8208;embedded hydrophobic SiO2 particles and subsurface thermochromic microcapsules within vertically distributed hierarchical porous structures. Moreover, the coating imparts superhydrophobicity, high infrared emission, and thermo&#8208;switchable sunlight reflectivity, enabling autonomous transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating prevents contamination and over&#8208;cooling caused by traditional radiative cooling materials, opening up new prospects for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of intelligent thermoregulatory coatings.

         <title>Unzippable Siamese Nanoparticles for Programmed Two&#8208;Stage Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Epigenetic drugs (epi&#8208;drugs) can destruct cancer cells and initiate both innate and adaptive immunity, yet they have achieved very limited success in solid tumors so far, partly attributing to their concurrent induction of the myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Here, we develop dissociable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) for tumor cell&#8208;targeted delivery of epi&#8208;drug CM&#8208;272 and MDSC&#8208;targeted delivery of small molecule inhibitor Ibrutinib. The SIANPs are assembled via interparticle DNA annealing and detached via tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered strand separation. Such binary regulation induces endogenous retrovirus expression and immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while restraining the immunosuppressive effects of MDSCs, and synergistically promote dendritic cell maturation and CD8+ T cell activation for tumor inhibition. Significantly, immune microenvironment remodeling via SIANPs further overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our study represents a two&#8208;pronged approach for orchestrating immune responses, and pave a new way for employing epi&#8208;drugs in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enhanced UV&#8208;C LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes in the UV&#8208;C spectral range (UV&#8208;C LEDs) can potentially replace bulky and toxic mercury lamps in a wide range of applications including sterilization and water purification. Several obstacles still limit the efficiencies of UV&#8208;C LEDs. Devices in flip&#8208;chip geometry suffer from a huge difference in the work functions between the p&#8208;AlGaN and high&#8208;reflective Al mirrors, whereas the absence of UV&#8208;C transparent current spreading layers limits the development of UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry. Here it is demonstrated that transfer&#8208;free graphene implemented directly onto the p&#8208;AlGaN top layer by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach enables highly efficient 275&#160;nm UV&#8208;C LEDs in both, flip&#8208;chip and standard geometry. In flip&#8208;chip geometry, the graphene acts as a contact interlayer between the Al&#8208;mirror and the p&#8208;AlGaN enabling an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.5% and a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 5.5% at 8&#160;V. Graphene combined with a &#8764;1&#160;nm NiOx support layer allows a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V. In standard geometry graphene acts as a current spreading layer on a length scale up to 1&#160;mm. These top&#8208;emitting devices exhibit a EQE of 2.1% at 8.7&#160;V and a WPE of 1.1%.

         <title>Hybrid Surface Modification and Bulk Doping Enable Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes for High&#8208;voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emerging market demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of energy storage devices has been pushing the disposal of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LiCoO2 (LCO) to shift toward sustainable upgrading into structurally stable high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface commodification strategy has been proposed to render spent LCO (S&#8208;LCO) to operate at high voltages, involving bulk Mn doping, near surface P gradient doping and Li3PO4/CoP (LPO/CP) coating on the LCO surface to yield upcycled LCO (defined as MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP). Benefiting from hybrid surface coating with Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 and electron conductive CoP coupled with Mn and P co&#8208;doping, the optimized MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP cathode exhibits enhanced high&#8208;voltage performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 218.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C with excellent capacity retention of 80.9% (0.5 C) after 200 cycles at a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V, along with 96.3% of capacity retention over 100 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. Our findings might afford meaningful construction for the upcycling of commercial S&#8208;LCO into next&#8208;generation upmarket cathode materials through the elaborate surface and bulk modification design.

         <title>Tandem Fields Facilitating Directional Carrier Migration in Van der Waals Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Piezo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 utilizing sustainable mechanical energy as well as earth&#8208;abundant water and oxygen is a green, cost&#8208;effective and promising approach. However, achieving simultaneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) faces huge challenges due to insufficient synergistic active sites and slow/messy carrier transfer. Herein, a novel 2D/2D van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction consisting of BiOIO3 and carbon nitride (BIO/CN) was elaborately designed for highly efficient overall H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis. Theoretical/experimental results revealed that a Z&#8208;scheme electron transfer was formed and facilitated by the tandem interfacial electric field and the bulk piezo&#8208;polarization field. On this basis, the carriers are efficiently separated while the oxidation/reduction capacity is preserved, thus providing strong driving force for the 2e&#8722; WOR and 2e&#8722; ORR on BIO and CN, respectively. Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic process of WOR and ORR for H2O2 synthesis improved remarkably. Therefore, BIO/CN exhibits an excellent H2O2 yield of 259.8 &#956;M within 30&#160;min in pure water and air atmosphere (without any sacrificial agents and aeration). This study provides a new idea on strategically controlling electron transfer towards high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis and expands the avenue for developing effective environmental purification materials.

         <title>Inhibiting Demetalation of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C via Mn Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Demetalation caused by the electrochemical dissolution of metallic Fe atoms is a major challenge for the practical application of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts. Herein, we construct an efficient single metallic Mn active site to improve the strength of the Fe&#8722;N bond, inhibiting the demetalation effect of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. Mn acts as an electron donor inducing more delocalized electrons to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density, thereby enhancing the Fe&#8722;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. The ORR pathway for the dissociation of Fe&#8208;Mn dual sites can overcome the high energy barriers to direct O&#8722;O bond dissociation and modulate the electronic states of Fe&#8722;N4 sites. The resulting FeMn&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.92&#160;V in alkaline electrolytes. FeMn&#8722;N&#8722;C as a cathode catalyst for Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) has a cycle stability of 700&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and a long cycle stability of more than 210&#160;h under extremely cold conditions at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and stable metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for various energy devices.

         <title>An Equalized Flow Velocity Strategy for Perovskite Colloidal Particles in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The non&#8208;uniform distribution of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor results in an imbalanced response to the shear force during flexible printing process. Herein, we have observed that the continuous disordered migration occurring in perovskite inks significantly contributes to the enlargement of colloidal particles size and diminishes the crystallization activity of the inks. Therefore, we have devised a molecular encapsulation architecture by glycerol monostearate (GMS) to mitigate colloidal particles collisions in the precursor ink, while simultaneously homogenizing the size distribution of perovskite colloids to minimize their diffusion disparities. The utilization of colloidal particles with a molecular encapsulation structure enables the achievement of uniform deposition during the printing process, thereby effectively balancing the crystallization rate and phase transition in the film and facilitating homogeneous crystallization of perovskite films. The large&#8208;area flexible perovskite device (1.01 cm2 and 100 cm2) fabricated through printing processes, achieved an efficiency of 24.45% and 15.87%, respectively, and manifest superior environmental stability, maintained an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric ambiences for 150 days (unencapsulated). This work demonstrates that the dynamics evolution process of colloidal particles in both the precursor ink and printing process represents a crucial stride towards achieving uniform crystallization of perovskite films.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scribed Battery Electrodes for Ultrafast Zinc&#8208;Ion Energy Storage</title>

Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications but are plagued by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials that enable high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and outstanding cycling stability. In this work, we design a laser&#8208;scribed nano&#8208;vanadium oxide (LNVO) cathode that can simultaneously achieve these properties. Our material stores charge through Faradaic redox reactions on/near the surface at fast rates owing to the small grain size (2&#8208;6&#160;nm) of vanadium oxide and interpenetrating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) graphene network, displaying a surface&#8208;controlled capacity contribution (90%&#8208;98%). Multiple characterization techniques unambiguously reveal that zinc and hydronium ions co&#8208;insert with minimal LNVO lattice change upon cycling. As a result, we demonstrate that a high specific capacity of 553 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved by the LNVO/Zn system at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and an impressive 264 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity can be retained at 100 A g&#8722;1 with a 10 s charge/discharge cycle, showing excellent rate capability. The LNVO/Zn is also capable of reaching &gt;90% capacity retention after 3,000 cycles at a high rate of 30 A g&#8722;1, as well as achieving both high energy (369&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and power densities (56,306&#160;W kg&#8722;1). Moreover, the LNVO cathode retains its excellent cycling performance when integrated into quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, further demonstrating mechanical stability and its potential for practical application in wearable and grid&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Electrolytes for Sodium Ion Batteries: The Current Transition from Liquid to Solid and Hybrid systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) have recently garnered significant interest in being employed alongside conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in applications where cost and sustainability are particularly relevant. The rapid progress in NIBs will undoubtedly expedite the commercialization process. In this regard, tailoring and designing electrolyte formulation is a top priority, as they profoundly influence the overall electrochemical performance and thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. Moreover, electrolytes play a critical role in determining the system's safety level and overall lifespan. This review delves into recent electrolyte advancements from liquid (organic and ionic liquid) to solid and quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (dry, hybrid, and single ion conducting electrolyte) for NIBs, encompassing comprehensive strategies for electrolyte design across various materials, systems and their functional applications. Our objective is to offer strategic direction for the systematic production of safe electrolytes and to investigate the potential applications of these designs in real&#8208;world scenarios while thoroughly assessing the current obstacles and forthcoming prospects within this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Modular Engineering of Aptamer&#8208;Based Nanobiotechnology for Conditional Control of ATP Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs in modular engineering of regulatable sensor technology via a combination of aptamer probe design with nanotechnology have allowed conditional control of ATP sensing with improved spatial precision. By highlighting their design motivation and working principles, this perspective intends to provide new insights into the development of nanobiotechnology for spatially controlled ATP detection.








Abstract
Dynamic changes of intracellular, extracellular, and subcellular adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) have fundamental interdependence with the physio&#8208;pathological states of cells. Spatially selective in situ imaging of such ATP dynamics offers valuable mechanistic insights into the related biological activities. Despite significant advances in the design of aptamer sensors for ATP detection, the dearth of methods that enable precise ATP imaging in specific cellular locations remains a challenge in this field. This review focuses on the modular engineering of regulatable sensing technology via the integration of aptamer probe designs with advanced functional nanomaterials, allowing conditional control of ATP sensing and imaging with high spatial precision from subcellular organelles to living animals. Highlighting the recent advances in the design of photo&#8208;triggered nanosensors for spatiotemporally controlled ATP imaging, endogenously&#8208;triggered ATP sensing in a cell&#8208;selective manner, and spatially&#8208;controlled nanodevices for ATP imaging in specific organelles and extracellular microenvironments. Emphasis will be put on elucidating the principles of how nanotechnology can be applied to regulate the spatial precision of aptamer&#8208;based ATP sensing activities. The authors envision that this perspective provides insights into the engineering of aptamer&#8208;based nanobiotechnology for opening new frontiers in precise molecular sensing and other bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Perspective on Tailored Nanostructure&#8208;Dominated SPP Effects for SERS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contributions of tailoring structure&#8208;dominated SPPs to SERS effects can be maximized by achieving highly efficient generation, lossless propagation, highly effective focusing, and perfectly coherent interferences of SPPs through careful quantitative design by combining 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D plasmonic/dielectric nanostructures to enable stronger coupling with LSPR at the hot spots for remarkable SERS performance improvement.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excited by an incident light can normally produce strong surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) at the nanogaps among plasmonic nano&#8208;objects (so&#8208;called hot spots), which is extensively explored. In contrast, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that can be generated by an incident beam via particular structures with a conservation of wave vectors can excite SERS effects as well. SPPs actually play an indispensable role in high&#8208;performance SERS devices but receive much less attention. In this perspective, SPPs and their couplings with LSPR for SERS excitations with differing effectiveness through particular plasmonic/dielectric structures/configurations, along with relevant fabrication approaches, are profoundly reviewed and commented on from a unique perspective from in situ to ex situ excitations of SERS enabled by spatiotemporally separated multiple processes of SPPs. Quantitative design of particular configurations/architectures enabling highly efficient and effective multiple processes of SPPs is particularly emphasized as one giant leap toward ultimate full quantitative design of intrinsically high&#8208;performance SERS chips and very critical for their batch manufacturability and applications as well. The viewpoints and prospects about innovative SERS devices based on tailored structure&#8208;dominated SPPs effects and their coupling with LSPR are presented and discussed.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Nanomaterials for Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensitive and accurate analysis for extracellular vesicles (EVs) has received substantial attention for noninvasive diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Owing to the excellent programmability and modifiability, DNA&#8208;based nanomaterials have emerged as powerful tools for detecting EVs. The recent advancements in EV analysis using a variety of DNA&#8208;based nanomaterials are overviewed and unresolved challenges and perspective directions in the field are discussed.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles comprising a myriad of molecular cargo such as proteins and nucleic acids, playing essential roles in intercellular communication and physiological and pathological processes. EVs have received substantial attention as noninvasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Monolithic 3D Integration of Analog RRAM&#8208;Based Computing&#8208;in&#8208;Memory and Sensor for Energy&#8208;Efficient Near&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (M3D) integration of photosensor array, analog computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM), and Si logic circuits, named M3D&#8208;SAIL is demonstrated, to implement an energy&#8208;efficient near&#8208;sensor computing (NSC) architecture. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 96.7% while with lower energy consumption and faster speed than its 2D counterpart.








Abstract
In the era of the Internet of Things, vast amounts of data generated at sensory nodes impose critical challenges on the data&#8208;transfer bandwidth and energy efficiency of computing hardware. A near&#8208;sensor computing (NSC) architecture places the processing units closer to the sensors such that the generated data can be processed almost in situ with high efficiency. This study demonstrates the monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (M3D) integration of a photosensor array, analog computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM), and Si complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits, named M3D&#8208;SAIL. This approach exploits the high&#8208;bandwidth on&#8208;chip data transfer and massively parallel CIM cores to realize an energy&#8208;efficient NSC architecture. The 1st layer of the Si CMOS circuits serves as the control logic and peripheral circuits. The 2nd layer comprises a 1&#160;k&#8208;bit one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;resistor (1T1R) array with InGaZnOx field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO&#8208;FET) and resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) for analog CIM. The 3rd layer comprises multiple IGZO&#8208;FET&#8208;based photosensor arrays for wavelength&#8208;dependent optical sensing. The structural integrity and function of each layer are comprehensively verified. Furthermore, NSC is implemented using the M3D&#8208;SAIL architecture for a typical video keyframe&#8208;extraction task, achieving a high classification accuracy of 96.7% as well as a 31.5&#215; lower energy consumption and 1.91&#215; faster computing speed compared to its&#160;2D counterpart.

         <title>Natural Wood&#8208;Derived Macroporous Cellulose for Highly Efficient and Ultrafast Elimination of Double&#8208;Stranded RNA from In Vitro&#8208;Transcribed mRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). Scalable mRNA purification can be also achieved by integrating a WMC&#8208;filled column with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromoatography. WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein&#160;mRNA expression efficiency and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a major impurity that can induce innate immune responses and cause adverse drug reactions. Removing dsRNA is an essential and non&#8208;trivial process in manufacturing mRNA. Current methods for dsRNA elimination use either high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography or microcrystalline cellulose, rendering the process complex, expensive, toxic, and/or time&#8208;consuming. This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). With a naturally formed large total pore area and low tortuosity, WMC removes up to 98% dsRNA within 5&#160;min. This significantly shortens the time for mRNA purification and improves purification efficiency. WMC can also be filled into chromatographic columns of different sizes and integrates with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromatography for large&#8208;scale mRNA purification to meet the requirements of mRNA manufacture. This study further shows that WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein mRNA expression efficiency by over 28% and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells. Successfully applying WMC provides an ultrafast and efficient platform for mRNA purification, enabling large&#8208;scale production with significant cost reduction.

The damage&#8208;free single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) dispersed using poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;terephthalamide) (PBIA) are selected as the orientation seed to improve the fiber microstructure and the mechanical properties. The p&#8208;SWNT/PBIA fibers exhibit an increase of 22% in tensile strength and 23% in elongation, with a maximum tensile strength of 7.01&#160;&#177;&#160;0.31&#160;GPa and a reinforcement efficiency of 893.6.








Abstract
Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;terephthalamide) (PBIA) fibers with excellent mechanical properties are widely used in fields that require impact&#8208;resistant materials such as ballistic protection and aerospace. The introduction of heterocycles in polymer chains increases their flexibility and makes it easier to optimize the fiber structure. However, the inadequate orientation of polymer chains is one of the main reasons for the large difference between the measured and theoretical mechanical properties of PBIA fibers. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are selected as an orientation seed. Their structural features allow CNTs to orient during the spinning process, which can induce an orderly arrangement of polymers and improve the orientation of the fiber microstructure. To ensure the complete 1D topology of long CNTs (&#8776;10&#160;&#181;m), PBIA is used as an efficient dispersant to overcome dispersion challenges. The p&#8208;CNT/PBIA fibers (10&#160;&#181;m single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube 0.025&#160;wt%) exhibit an increase of 22% in tensile strength and 23% in elongation, with a maximum tensile strength of 7.01&#160;&#177;&#160;0.31&#160;GPa and a reinforcement efficiency of 893.6. The artificial muscle fabricated using CNT/PBIA fibers exhibits a 34.8% contraction and a 25% lifting of a 2&#160;kg dumbbell, providing a promising paradigm for high&#8208;performance organic fibers as high&#8208;load smart actuators.

         <title>Engineered CpG&#8208;Loaded Nanorobots Drive Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Immunity for TLR9&#8208;Positive Cancer Therapy</title>

In this study, an intelligent tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanorobot is developed that effectively delivers CpG payloads to Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9)&#8208;positive tumors to induce autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death for immunotherapy.








Abstract
Smart nanorobots have emerged as novel drug delivery platforms in nanomedicine, potentially improving anti&#8208;cancer efficacy and reducing side effects. In this study, an intelligent tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanorobot is developed that effectively delivers CpG payloads to Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9)&#8208;positive tumors to induce autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death for immunotherapy. The nanorobots are fabricated by co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of two amphiphilic triblock polymer peptides: one containing the matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;cleaved GPLGVRGS motif to control the mechanical opening of the nanorobots and provide targeting capability for TLR&#8208;9&#8208;positive tumors and the other consisting of an arginine&#8208;rich GRRRDRGRS sequence that can condense nuclear acid payloads through electrostatic interactions. Using multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models, it is investigated whether the intravenous injection of CpG&#8208;loaded nanorobots could effectively deliver CpG payloads to TLR&#8208;9&#8208;positive tumors and elicit anti&#8208;tumor immunity through TLR9 signaling and autophagy. Therefore, besides being a commonly used adjuvant for tumor vaccination, CpG&#8208;loaded nanorobots can effectively reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and suppress tumor growth and recurrence. This nanorobot&#8208;based CpG immunotherapy can be considered a feasible approach to induce anti&#8208;tumor immunity, showing great therapeutic potential for the future treatment of TLR9&#8208;positive cancers.

         <title>Porous 2D Catalyst Covers Improve Photoelectrochemical Water&#8208;Oxidation Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous graphene (pGr)&#8208;covered NiOx electrocatalyst is designed to improve water oxidation of Si&#8208;based photoanodes, compared to the intrinsic Gr cover and cover&#8208;free counterparts. It is demonstrated that a pGr cover with optimized pore size balances the interfacial charge and mass transfer, ensures the structural stability of photoanodes, and enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity of active sites by reducing the reaction overpotential.








Abstract
Confined catalysis under the cover of 2D materials has emerged as a promising approach for achieving highly effective catalysts in various essential reactions. In this work, a porous cover structure is designed to boost the interfacial charge and mass transfer kinetics of 2D&#8208;covered catalysts. The improvement in catalytic performance is confirmed by the photoelectrochemical oxidation evolution reaction (OER) on a photoanode based on an n&#8208;Si substrate modified with a NiOx thin&#8208;film model electrocatalyst covered with a porous graphene (pGr) monolayer. Experimental results demonstrate that the pGr cover enhances the OER kinetics by balancing the charge and mass transfer at the photoanode and electrolyte interface compared to the intrinsic graphene cover and cover&#8208;free control samples. Theoretical investigations further corroborate that the pore edges of the pGr cover boost the intrinsic catalytic activity of active sites on NiOx by reducing the reaction overpotential. Furthermore, the optimized pores, which can be easily controlled by plasma bombardment, allow oxygen molecules produced in the OER to pass through without peeling off the pGr cover, thus ensuring the structural stability of the catalyst. This study highlights the significant role of the porous cover structure in 2D&#8208;covered catalysts and provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Reprogramming&#8208;Inspired Dynamically Responsive Hydrogel Boosts the Induction of Pluripotency via Phase&#8208;Separated Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based strategy is employed to fabricate cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. The cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel boosts the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from mouse and human somatic cells via phase&#8208;separated yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have wide applications in disease modeling, personalized medicine, and tissue engineering. The generation of iPSCs from somatic cells via transcriptional&#8208;factor&#8208; or chemical molecule&#8208;based approaches are time&#8208;consuming and inefficient. Here, a cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel is fabricated via a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based strategy. Human and mouse somatic cells (including senescent cells) are efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. The cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel possesses dynamic bioresponsiveness, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. Mechanistic study demonstrates that the autonomous change of the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel elicits the formation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates with the appropriate timing during cell reprogramming, ensuring a faster and more efficient generation of iPSCs than conventional cell reprogramming approach. Taken together, this study reveals the robust induction of pluripotency by coordination of cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel and phase&#8208;separated biomolecular condensates.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells with Homogeneous Transmission and Colorful Reflection Enabled by an ITO&#8208;Free Microcavity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an indium tin oxide&#8208;free optical microcavity architecture into semitransparent organic photovoltaics for achieving high transmittance homogeneity with controllable reflection through tunning the individual component layer thickness is introduced. And six parameters based on optical characteristics of subunits to provide a quantitative description for the transmittance brightness, transmissive and reflective color purity, and versatility of optical arrays, is proposed.








Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs), owing to the merits of high power generation, thermal insulation, and aesthetic features, have become a promising candidate for intellectual building&#8208; integrated photovoltaic windows.

&lt;p&gt;Here, an indium tin oxide-free optical microcavity architecture into semitransparent organic photovoltaics for achieving high transmittance homogeneity with controllable reflection through tunning the individual component layer thickness is introduced. And six parameters based on optical characteristics of subunits to provide a quantitative description for the transmittance brightness, transmissive and reflective color purity, and versatility of optical arrays, is proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs), owing to the merits of high power generation, thermal insulation, and aesthetic features, have become a promising candidate for intellectual building- integrated photovoltaic windows. However, the traditional optical evaluation only focuses on the transmission properties and ignores the reflection behaviors. And the lack of quantitative descriptions for array appearance hinders implementation of ST-OPV based large-area modules. To tackle with these issues, an indium tin oxide (ITO)-free optical microcavity architecture into ST-OPVs for achieving high homogeneity in transmittance with controllable reflective appearances through tunning the thickness of individual component layers is introduced. A set of parameters based on optical characteristics of sub-units to provide a quantitative description for the transmittance brightness, transmissive and reflective color purity, and versatility of optical arrays, is further proposed. The optical simulations reveal that reflection modulation from blue to red colors can be realized for devices based on various bulk-heterojunction material systems through regulating the thickness of active layers and antireflection coatings. This work offers a viable design strategy for ST-OPVs toward applications in next-generation smart photovoltaic windows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products at CuSiO3/CuO Derived Interfaces in Ordered Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered porous p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO is designed to maximize active interface sites for CO2RR. The resulting p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO exhibits remarkable stability, achieving a high C2+ faradaic efficiency of 91.7% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the active interface facilitates CO2 activation, lowering the formation energy of *OCCOH and enhancing CO2 conversion to C2+.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added multicarbon (C2+) chemicals holds promise for reducing CO2 emissions and advancing carbon neutrality. However, achieving both high conversion rate and selectivity remains challenging due to the limited active sites on catalysts for carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#9472;C) coupling. Herein, porous CuO is coated with amorphous CuSiO3 (p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO) to maximize the active interface sites, enabling efficient CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Significantly, the p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO catalyst exhibits impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.8% in an H&#8208;cell at &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#160;M KHCO3 and remarkable C2H4 and C2+ FEs of 82% and 91.7% in a flow cell at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the active interfaces facilitate CO2 activation and lower the formation energy of the key intermediate *OCCOH, thus promoting CO2 conversion to C2+. This work provides a rational design for steering the active sites toward C2+ products.

Tailored Nanostructure&#8208;Dominated SPP Effects for SERS
In article number 2303001 by Peipei Chen, Weiguo Chu, and co&#8208;workers, the combination of surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmon resonance effects is proposed and discussed for quantitative design of particular nanostructures of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors with possible easy batch manufacture for effective and efficient detection of targets with sizes from sub&#8208;nanometers to tens of nanometers. This would innovate the conventional recognition about SERS sensors and thus endow SERS sensors with adequate animation.

A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type small molecules, with one electron&#8208;donating (D) core flanked by two electron&#8208;accepting (A) units, are an essential branch of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, advances in material development and voltage loss are highlighted. Their roles are reviewed in ternary organic photovoltaics, applications in indoor photovoltaics, and device stability. Finally, the challenges and development directions of these A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type NFAs are discussed.








Abstract
The A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type molecules consist of one electron&#8208;donating (D) core flanked by two electron&#8208;accepting units (A1 and A2) and have emerged as an essential branch of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). These molecules generally possess higher molecular energy levels and wider optical bandgaps compared with those of the classic A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208; and A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs, owing to the attenuated intramolecular charge transfer effect. These characteristics make them compelling choices for the fabrication of high&#8208;voltage organic photovoltaics (OPVs), ternary OPVs, and indoor OPVs. Herein, the recent progress in the A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type NFAs are reviewed, including the molecular engineering, structure&#8208;property relationships, voltage loss (Vloss), device stability, and photovoltaic performance of binary, ternary, and indoor OPVs. Finally, the challenges and provided prospects are discussed for the further development of this type of NFAs.

Abstract
Materialomics integrates experiment, theory, and computation in a high&#8208;throughput manner, and has changed the paradigm for the research and development of new functional materials. Recently, with the rapid development of high&#8208;throughput characterization and machine&#8208;learning technologies, the establishment of biomaterialomics that tackles complex physiological behaviors has become accessible. Breakthroughs in the clinical translation of nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines have been observed. Herein, recent advances in biomaterials, including polymers, lipid&#8208;like materials, and peptides/proteins, discovered through high&#8208;throughput screening or machine learning&#8208;assisted methods, are summarized. The molecular design of structure&#8208;diversified libraries; high&#8208;throughput characterization, screening, and preparation; and, their applications in drug delivery and clinical translation are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the prospects and main challenges in future biomaterialomics and high&#8208;throughput screening development are highlighted.

         <title>Construction of High Accuracy Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Surface/Interface of Nanomaterials&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a groundbreaking tool for the precise simulation of surfaces and interfaces in nanomaterials. This review delineates the fundamental principles, practical implementations, and multifaceted applications of MLIPs for examining the surface and interfacial dynamics of nanoscale materials. Additionally, it addresses the current challenges facing this potent computational methodology.








Abstract
The inherent discontinuity and unique dimensional attributes of nanomaterial surfaces and interfaces bestow them with various exceptional properties. These properties, however, also introduce difficulties for both experimental and computational studies. The advent of machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) addresses some of the limitations associated with empirical force fields, presenting a valuable avenue for accurate simulations of these surfaces/interfaces of nanomaterials. Central to this approach is the idea of capturing the relationship between system configuration and potential energy, leveraging the proficiency of machine learning (ML) to precisely approximate high&#8208;dimensional functions. This review offers an in&#8208;depth examination of MLIP principles and their execution and elaborates on their applications in the realm of nanomaterial surface and interface systems. The prevailing challenges faced by this potent methodology are also discussed.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Single&#8208; and Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest achievements in the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalysis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are summarized. A brief introduction of the fundamentals and fabrication approaches of SACs and DACs is given, followed by highlighting the diverse applications of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal SACs and DACs in solar&#8208;driven artificial photosynthesis. The review ends with relevant opportunities, challenges, and perspectives.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis enables direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion aimed at mitigating environmental pollution and producing solar fuels and chemicals in a green and sustainable approach, and efficient, robust, and low&#8208;cost photocatalysts are the heart of artificial photosynthesis systems. As an emerging new class of cocatalytic materials, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have received a great deal of current attention due to their maximal atom utilization and unique photocatalytic properties, whereas noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free ones impart abundance, availability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness allowing for scalable implementation. This review outlines the fundamental principles and synthetic methods of SACs and DACs and summarizes the most recent advances in SACs (Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, Bi, Al, Sn, Er, La, Ba, etc.) and DACs (CuNi, FeCo, InCu, KNa, CoCo, CuCu, etc.) based on non&#8208;noble metals, confined on an arsenal of organic or inorganic substrates (polymeric carbon nitride, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, carbon, etc.) acting as versatile scaffolds in solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, methane conversion, organic synthesis, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and environmental remediation. The review concludes with the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free SACs and DACs for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectrics: Theories, Materials, and Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D vdW ferroelectric materials reveal great potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics, owing to robust spontaneous polarization, widespread bandgap tunability, inert surfaces, and silicon&#8208;based technology compatibility. This review covers their recent advances in ferroelectricity origin and practical applications, especially in artificial intelligence. The hot topic of sliding ferroelectrics in physical origins and novel properties is also focused on.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials are theory&#8208;predicted or laboratory&#8208;validated to possess in&#8208;plane (IP) and/or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. Due to their dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces, interlayer charge coupling, robust polarization, tunable energy band structures, and compatibility with silicon&#8208;based technologies, vdW ferroelectric materials exhibit great promise in ferroelectric memories, neuromorphic computing, nanogenerators, photovoltaic devices, spintronic devices, and so on. Here, the very recent advances in the field of vdW ferroelectrics (FEs) are reviewed. First, theories of ferroelectricity are briefly discussed. Then, a comprehensive summary of the non&#8208;stacking vdW ferroelectric materials is provided based on their crystal structures and the emerging sliding ferroelectrics. In addition, their potential applications in various branches/frontier fields are enumerated, with a focus on artificial intelligence. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of vdW ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Nanomedicine for T&#8208;Cell Mediated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicines provide modular platforms enabling T&#8208;cell immunotherapy enhancement. The impact of different nanomaterials on immunotherapy and the mechanisms involved deserve further study. Nanomedicine&#8208;based combination therapy can enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, but require rational control over site of action and dose. Overall, nanomedicine offers promising solutions to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, which will further advance its clinical application.








Abstract
T&#8208;cell immunotherapy offers outstanding advantages in the treatment of various diseases, and with the selection of appropriate targets, efficient disease treatment can be achieved. T&#8208;cell immunotherapy has made great progress, but clinical results show that only a small proportion of patients can benefit from T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. The extensive mechanistic work outlines a blueprint for using T cells as a new option for immunotherapy, but also presents new challenges, including the balance between different fractions of T cells, the inherent T&#8208;cell suppression patterns in the disease microenvironment, the acquired loss of targets, and the decline of T&#8208;cell viability. The diversity, flexibility, and intelligence of nanomedicines give them great potential for enhancing T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. Here, how T&#8208;cell immunotherapy strategies can be adapted with different nanomaterials to enhance therapeutic efficacy is discussed. For two different pathological states, immunosuppression and immune activation, recent advances in nanomedicines for T&#8208;cell immunotherapy in diseases such as cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes are summarized. With a focus on T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, this review highlights the outstanding advantages of nanomedicines in disease treatment, and helps advance one's understanding of the use of nanotechnology to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy.

         <title>Emerging Spintronic Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims at discussing the spin&#8208;related performance and functionalities of diverse emerging spintronic material systems. The spin transport/manipulation properties of organic semiconductors, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, and 2D materials are discussed in the first place, respectively. Following, device multifunctionalities based on these materials are discussed, including spin&#8208;filter effect via chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity, spin&#8208;photovoltaic, spin&#8208;light&#8208;emitting, and spin&#8208;transistor functions.








Abstract
The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultrahigh&#8208;speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge&#8208;based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next&#8208;generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multifunctionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and 2D materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfill the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, these promising materials are systematically reviewed for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) are discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) are overviewed, including the spin&#8208;filter effect, spin&#8208;photovoltaics, spin&#8208;light emitting devices, and spin&#8208;transistor functions. Subsequently, challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics are presented.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Management and Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work summarizes the advances in morphology optimization in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells from the viewpoint of efficient charge management and energy loss reduction, aiming to provide useful guidance in further materials design and device optimization and promote further development of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) have received tremendous attention in recent decades because of their advantages over their polymer counterparts. These advantages include well&#8208;defined chemical structures, easy purification, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation. Remarkable progress with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17% has recently been achieved with improved charge management (FF &#215; JSC) and reduced energy loss (Eloss). Morphology control is the key factor in the progress of ASM&#8208;OSCs, which remains a significant challenge because of the similarities in the molecular structures of the donors and acceptors. In this review, the effective strategies for charge management and/or Eloss reduction from the perspective of effective morphology control are summarized.

     alt="Optimization of Charge Management and Energy Loss in All-Small-Molecule Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work summarizes the advances in morphology optimization in all-small-molecule organic solar cells from the viewpoint of efficient charge management and energy loss reduction, aiming to provide useful guidance in further materials design and device optimization and promote further development of all-small-molecule organic solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have received tremendous attention in recent decades because of their advantages over their polymer counterparts. These advantages include well-defined chemical structures, easy purification, and negligible batch-to-batch variation. Remarkable progress with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17% has recently been achieved with improved charge management (FF &#215; &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduced energy loss (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;). Morphology control is the key factor in the progress of ASM-OSCs, which remains a significant challenge because of the similarities in the molecular structures of the donors and acceptors. In this review, the effective strategies for charge management and/or &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; reduction from the perspective of effective morphology control are summarized. The aim is to provide practical insights and guidance for material design and device optimization to promote further development of ASM-OSCs to a level where they can compete with or even surpass the efficiency of polymer solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Sensitive Intelligent Nanosystems: A Promising Strategy for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines promising advances in ultrasound therapy for neurological diseases. It discusses design strategies and diversification types for ultrasound&#8208;sensitive intelligent nanosystems (USINs). Biological applications of USINs&#8208;enhanced ultrasound for neurological disorders are also summarized. Rapid developments in this field are expected to facilitate precise and safe treatments for such diseases.








Abstract
Neurological diseases are a major global health challenge, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Ultrasound therapy plays an irreplaceable role in the treatment of neurological diseases due to its noninvasive, highly focused, and strong tissue penetration capabilities. However, the complexity of brain and nervous system and the safety risks associated with prolonged exposure to ultrasound therapy severely limit the applicability of ultrasound therapy. Ultrasound&#8208;sensitive intelligent nanosystems (USINs) are a novel therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases that bring greater spatiotemporal controllability and improve safety to overcome these challenges. This review provides a detailed overview of therapeutic strategies and clinical advances of ultrasound in neurological diseases, focusing on the potential of USINs&#8208;based ultrasound in the treatment of neurological diseases. Based on the physical and chemical effects induced by ultrasound, rational design of USINs is a prerequisite for improving the efficacy of ultrasound therapy. Recent developments of ultrasound&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers and nanoagents are systemically reviewed. Finally, the challenges and developing prospects of USINs are discussed in depth, with a view to providing useful insights and guidance for efficient ultrasound treatment of neurological diseases.

         <title>Physiological Barriers and Strategies of Lipid&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Nucleic Acid Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 22, May 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are currently the most promising delivery vehicles of nucleic acid drugs. However, their delivery efficiency and safety are largely compromised by a cascade of physiological barriers. In this review, the five different levels of physiological barriers for LBNP&#8208;based nucleic acids delivery and the current coping strategies are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are currently the most promising vehicles for nucleic acid drug (NAD) delivery. Although their clinical applications have achieved success, the NAD delivery efficiency and safety are still unsatisfactory, which are, to a large extent, due to the existence of multi&#8208;level physiological barriers in vivo. It is important to elucidate the interactions between these barriers and LBNPs, which will guide more rational design of efficient NAD vehicles with low adverse effects and facilitate broader applications of nucleic acid therapeutics. This review describes the obstacles and challenges of biological barriers to NAD delivery at systemic, organ, sub&#8208;organ, cellular, and subcellular levels. The strategies to overcome these barriers are comprehensively reviewed, mainly including physically/chemically engineering LBNPs and directly modifying physiological barriers by auxiliary treatments. Then the potentials and challenges for successful translation of these preclinical studies into the clinic are discussed. In the end, a forward look at the strategies on manipulating protein corona (PC) is addressed, which may pull off the trick of overcoming those physiological barriers and significantly improve the efficacy and safety of LBNP&#8208;based NADs delivery.

         <title>Cultivating High&#8208;Performance Flexible All&#8208;in&#8208;One Supercapacitors With 3D Network Through Continuous Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis, harnessing uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose. The design establishes a seamless electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure and facilitates stress transfer within and between layers. Thereby, the supercapacitor demonstrates remarkable shear and bending resistance, presenting a promising approach for the integrated development of high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.








Abstract
Flexible supercapacitors can potentially power next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), a flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm&#8722;2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15&#160;MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6&#160;kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway toward high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.

         <title>Unconventional Band Structure via Combined Molecular Orbital and Lattice Symmetries in a Surface&#8208;Confined Metallated Graphdiyne Sheet</title>

ToC Figure illustrates the emergence of unconventional band structure in mesoscopically (&#8776;1 &#181;m) ordered metallated&#8208;graphdiyne single sheet due to combined frontier molecular orbital and lattice symmetries.








Abstract
Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based monolayers represent the next generation 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials with tunable structures and properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the detection of band formation in atomically thin GY/GDY analogues has been challenging, as both long&#8208;range order and atomic precision have to be fulfilled in the system. The present&#160;work reports direct evidence of band formation in on&#8208;surface synthesized metallated Ag&#8208;GDY sheets with mesoscopic (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m) regularity. Employing scanning tunneling and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopies, energy&#8208;dependent transitions of real&#8208;space electronic states above the Fermi level and formation of the valence band are respectively observed. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the observations and reveal that doubly degenerate frontier molecular orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close to the Fermi level. DFT modeling also indicates an intrinsic band gap for the pristine sheet material, which is retained for a bilayer with h&#8208;BN, whereas adsorption&#8208;induced in&#8208;gap electronic states evolve at the synthesis platform with Ag&#8208;GDY decorating the (111) facet of silver. These results illustrate the tremendous potential for engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries in atomically precise 2D carbon materials.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Volumetric Desalination Capacity Using Compact MoS2 Nanolaminates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 nanolaminates with compact architecture achieved high capacitance up to &#8764;277.5 F cm&#8722;3 under scan rate of 1000 mV s&#8722;1. The electrode demonstrates an exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1 mgNaCl cm&#8722;3 in capacitive deionization. Theoretical analysis reveals 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, and ion hydration, channel confinement also play critical role in ion adsorption.








Abstract
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low&#8208;salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, a high&#8208;density semi&#8208;metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieve high capacitance up to &#8776;277.5&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1 with a lower charge&#8208;transfer resistance and nearly tenfold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrode, is reported. Furthermore, 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 electrode demonstrates exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1&#160;mgNaCl&#160;cm&#8722;3 in CDI experiments. Ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption. Overall, this work provides a new method to design compact 2D&#8208;layered nanolaminates with high&#8208;volumetric performance for CDI desalination.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altermagnets exhibit momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states providing new opportunities for spin electronic devices. Through temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and disordered local moment calculations, it is demonstrated that the relativistic valence band splitting of the prototypical MnTe altermagnet is of magnetic origin. This is attributed to a novel relativistic spin&#8208;splitting phenomenon concurrent with the establishment of the altermagnetic order below the N&#233;el temperature.








Abstract
Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non&#8208;relativistic, momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin&#8208;splitting are documented within the framework of the non&#8208;relativistic spin group symmetry, there is limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin&#8208;splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, &#945;&#8722;MnTe. Employing temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order is elucidated. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature&#8208;dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin&#8208;splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in &#945;&#8722;MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Functionalized Microgels as Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells to Regulate Expansion of T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels are fabricated as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) to present stimulatory ligands specifically on the surface. Surface&#8208;specific functionalization is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coatings, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. Microgels modified with appropriate ligands promote polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific T cell expansion and regulate T cell phenotype and function.








Abstract
Artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system can enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, it is shown that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface&#8208;specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. The authors demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype, and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio, and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.

         <title>5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural and its Downstream Chemicals: A Review of Catalytic Routes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomass assumes an increasingly vital role in the realm of renewable energy and sustainable development due to its abundant availability, renewability, and minimal environmental impact. Within this context, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from sugar dehydration, stands out as a critical bio&#8208;derived product. It serves as a pivotal multifunctional platform compound, integral in synthesizing various vital chemicals, including furan&#8208;based polymers, fine chemicals, and biofuels. The high reactivity of HMF, attributed to its highly active aldehyde, hydroxyl, and furan ring, underscores the challenge of selectively regulating its conversion to obtain the desired products. This review highlights the research progress on efficient catalytic systems for HMF synthesis, oxidation, reduction, and etherification. Additionally, it outlines the techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and prospective research directions for the production of furan&#8208;based chemicals. Despite significant progress in catalysis research, and certain process routes demonstrating substantial economics, with key indicators surpassing petroleum&#8208;based products, a gap persists between fundamental research and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This is due to the lack of comprehensive engineering research on bio&#8208;based chemicals, making the commercialization process a distant goal. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of this field.

         <title>Fully 3D&#8208;Printed Miniature Soft Hydraulic Actuators with Shape Memory Effect for Morphing and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Miniature shape&#8208;morphing soft actuators driven by external stimuli and fluidic pressure hold great promise in morphing matter and small&#8208;scale soft robotics. However, it remains challenging to achieve both rich shape morphing and shape locking in a fast and controlled way due to the limitations of actuation reversibility and fabrication. Here, we report fully 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect for programmable fast shape morphing and shape locking. It combines commercial high&#8208;resolution multi&#8208;material 3D printing of stiff shape memory polymers (SMPs) and soft elastomers and direct printing of microfluidic channels and 2D/3D channel networks embedded in elastomers in a single print run. We demonstrated leveraging spatial patterning of hybrid compositions and expansion heterogeneity of microfluidic channel networks for versatile hydraulically actuated shape morphing, including circular, wavy, helical, saddle, and warping shapes with various curvatures. The morphed shapes can be temporarily locked and recover to their original planar forms repeatedly by activating shape memory effect of the SMPs. Utilizing the fast shape morphing and locking in the miniature actuators, we demonstrated their potential applications in non&#8208;invasive manipulation of small&#8208;scale objects and fragile living organisms, multimodal entanglement grasping, and energy&#8208;saving manipulators.

Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems can emulate biological retinal systems to perceive visual information under different levels of illumination, making them considerable potential for future intelligent vehicles and vision automation.

&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic visual systems can emulate biological retinal systems to perceive visual information under different levels of illumination, making them considerable potential for future intelligent vehicles and vision automation. However, the complex circuits and high operating voltages of conventional artificial vision systems present great challenges for device integration and power consumption. Here, we report bioinspired synaptic transistors based on organic single crystal phototransistors, which exhibit excitation and inhibition synaptic plasticity with time-varying. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers of organic crystal-electret vertical stacks, organic transistors can operate below 1&#160;V with record high on/off ratios close to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and sharp switching with a subthreshold swing of 59.8&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the approach offers visual adaptation with highly localized modulation and over 98.2% recognition accuracy&#160;under different illumination levels.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrochemical Responses of MOF&#8208;74 Via Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Superior Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;defects engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is performed to manipulate the electrochemical response. Using&#160;salicylic acid and cobalt doping for defect introduction, the modified MOF exhibits 4.4 times the discharging capacity of the original, resulting in a superior cathode for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The comprehensive investigations provide critical insights into the electrochemical reconfiguration mechanism.








Abstract
Rationally designed defects in a crystal can confer unique properties. This study showcases a novel dual&#8208;defects engineering strategy to tailor the electrochemical response of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials used for electrochemical energy storage. Salicylic acid (SA) is identified as an effective modulator to control MOF&#8208;74 growth and induce structural defects, and cobalt cation doping is adopted for introducing a second type of defect. The resulting dual&#8208;defects engineered bimetallic MOF exhibits a discharging capacity of 218.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 4.4 times that of the pristine MOF&#8208;74, and significantly improved cycling stability. Moreover, the engineered MOF&#8208;74(Ni0.675Co0.325)&#8208;8//Zn aqueous battery shows top energy/power density performances for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries (266.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 17.22&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). Comprehensive investigations reveal that engineered defects modify the local coordination environment and promote the in situ electrochemical reconfiguration during operation to significantly boost the electrochemical activity. This work suggests that rational tailoring of the defects within the MOF crystal is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of the metal centers and the corresponding electrochemical reconfiguration for electrochemical applications.

This review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest developments in flexible magneto&#8208;sensitive devices, including the fabrications and mechanical regulations of flexible magneto&#8208;sensitive materials and the principles and performances of flexible magnetic sensors, as well as their applications for wearable electronics.








Abstract
Emerging fields, such as wearable electronics, digital healthcare, the Internet of Things, and humanoid robots, highlight the need for flexible devices capable of recording signals on curved surfaces and soft objects. In particular, flexible magnetosensitive devices garner significant attention owing to their ability to combine the advantages of flexible electronics and magnetoelectronic devices, such as reshaping capability, conformability, contactless sensing, and navigation capability. Several key challenges must be addressed to develop well&#8208;functional flexible magnetic devices. These include determining how to make magnetic materials flexible and even elastic, understanding how the physical properties of magnetic films change under external strain and stress, and designing and constructing flexible magnetosensitive devices. In recent years, significant progress is made in addressing these challenges. This study aims to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the most recent developments in flexible magnetosensitive devices. This includes discussions on the fabrications and mechanical regulations of flexible magnetic materials, the principles and performances of flexible magnetic sensors, and their applications for wearable electronics.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Single Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many heterogeneous catalytic processes are key to developing sustainable products and energy. Visualization and analysis of dynamic single atom catalysis provide insights into the processes. The example shows in&#160;situ ESTEM&#8208;HAADF observations of carbon supported platinum catalysts important for fuel cells, revealing single atoms, atom clusters and multiple phases at 400&#160;&#176;C in hydrogen gas. The scale bar is 5&#160;nm.








Abstract
Many industrial chemical processes, including for producing fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental controls, employ heterogeneous solid state catalysts at elevated temperatures in gas or liquid environments. Dynamic reactions at the atomic level play a critical role in catalyst stability and functionality. In situ visualization and analysis of atomic&#8208;scale processes in real time under controlled reaction environments can provide important insights into practical frameworks to improve catalytic processes and materials. This review focuses on innovative real time in situ electron microscopy (EM)&#160;methods, including recent progress in analytical in&#160;situ environmental (scanning) transmission EM (E(STEM), incorporating environmental scanning TEM (ESTEM) and environmental transmission EM (ETEM), with single atom resolution for visualizing and analysing dynamic single atom catalysis under controlled flowing gas reaction environments. ESTEM studies of single atom dynamics of reactions, and of sintering deactivation, contribute to a better&#8208;informed understanding of the yield and stability of catalyst operations. Advances in in situ technologies, including gas and liquid sample holders, nanotomography, and higher voltages, as well as challenges and opportunities in tracking reacting atoms, are highlighted. The findings show that the understanding and application of fundamental processes in catalysis can be improved, with valuable economic, environmental, and societal benefits.

         <title>A Cable&#8208;Stayed Honeycomb Superstructure to Improve the Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Materials via Inhibiting Interlaminar Lattice Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is constructed by inducing high Li/Ni disorder in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. The short&#8208;range order of the honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by the neutron pair distribution function. Benefiting from the high voltage stability and a superior crystal cell evolution mechanism of the cable&#8208;stayed superstructure, excellent cycle performance of the Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell is achieved.








Abstract
In layered Li&#8208;rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in transition metal (TM)&#160;layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li&#8208;rich materials. Here a Li&#8208;rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder is reported, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni&#9472;O bonds act as cable&#8208;stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high&#8208;voltage stability. The cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in&#8208;plane expansion along a&#8208;axis and inhibiting c&#8208;axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li&#8208;rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium&#8208;rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>All&#8208;Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano&#8208;regions over a large area in SrCoO2.5 thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all&#8208;oxide metasurfaces.








Abstract
Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three&#8208;terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non&#8208;uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices.

     alt="All-Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano-regions over a large area in SrCoO&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all-oxide metasurfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three-terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non-uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices. Designer metasurfaces formed in this way from SrCoO&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; thin films display an anomalous optical reflection of light that relies on the uniform and coherent response of all the devices. Beyond oxides, almost any material whose properties can be controlled by the addition or removal of ions via gating can form novel metasurfaces using this technique. These findings provide insights into the electrokinetics of ionic gating and a wide range of applications using synchronized local ionic gating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intranasal Delivery of Near&#8208;Infrared and Magnetic Dual&#8208;Response Nanospheres to Rapidly Produce Antidepressant&#8208;Like and Cognitive Enhancement Effects</title>

Inspired from snuff bottle, a nasal delivery system with the combination of iron supplementation and a peripheral D2 receptor antagonist is developed for dopamine receptors upregulation which can solve a variety of mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and improve cognition of patients.








Abstract
Restricted by synaptic plasticity, dopamine receptor (DR) upregulation takes a long time to work. Moreover, the impact of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) on delivery efficiency restricts the development of drugs. Taking inspiration from snuff bottles, a convenient, fast&#8208;acting, and nonaddictive nasal drug delivery system has been developed to rapidly reshape the balance of synaptic transmitters. This optical and magnetic response system called CFs@DP, comprised of carbonized MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) frameworks (CFs) and domperidone (DP), which can enter the brain via nasal administration. Under dual stimulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and catecholamine&#8208;induced complexation, CFs@DP disintegrates to release iron ions and DP, causing upregulation of the dopamine type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2) receptors, and brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to achieve a therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the DR density of mice (postnatal day 50&#8211;60) increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) after 10 days of therapy, resulting in antidepressant&#8208;like and cognitive enhancement effects. Interestingly, the cognitive enhancement effect of CFs@DP is even working in noniron deficiency (normal fed) mice, making it a promising candidate for application in enhancing learning ability.

         <title>Balancing Polarization and Breakdown for High Capacitive Energy Storage by Microstructure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The compromise of contradictive parameters, polarization and breakdown strength, is necessary to achieve a high energy storage performance. The two can be tuned, regardless of material types, by controlling microstructures: amorphous states possess higher breakdown strength, while crystalline states have larger polarization. However, how to achieve a balance of amorphous and crystalline phases requires systematic and quantitative investigations. Herein, we comprehensively evaluated the trade&#8208;off between polarization and breakdown field with the evolution of microstructure, i.e., grain size and crystallinity, by phase&#8208;field simulations. The results indicate small grain size (&#8764;10&#8208;35&#160;nm) with moderate crystallinity (&#8764;60%&#8764;80%) is more beneficial to maintain relatively high polarization and breakdown field simultaneously, consequently contributing to a high overall energy storage performance. Experimentally, we therefore achieved an ultrahigh energy density of 131 J cm&#8722;3 with a high efficiency of 81.6% in the microcrystal&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase Bi3NdTi4O12 films. This work provides a guidance to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a simple and effective microstructure design.

         <title>Surfactant Self&#8208;Assembly Enhances Tribopositivity of Stretchable Ionic Conductors for Wearable Energy Harvesting and Motion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Boosting stretchability and electric output is critical for high&#8208;performance wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). Herein, for the first time, we propose a new approach for tuning the composition of surface functional groups through surfactant self&#8208;assembly to improve the tribopositivity, where the assembly increases the transferred charge density and the relative permittivity of water polyurethane (WPU). Incorporating bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) and alkali metal ions into a mixture of WPU and the surfactant forms a stretchable film that simultaneously functions as positive tribolayer and electrode, preventing the conventional detachment of tribolayer and electrode in long term usage. Further the introduction of surfactant and alkali metal ions in WPU forms a strong crosslinking network. Resultantly, the conductivity of the crosslinked film reaches 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mS cm&#8722;1 while the elongation at break reaches 362%, which are 4.8&#215;104&#8208;fold and 1.3&#8208;fold higher than pristine WPU, respectively. Moreover, the surfactant self&#8208;assembly impedes the adverse impact of the fluorine&#8208;containing groups on tribopositivity. The self&#8208;assembled and LiTFSI&#8208;doped WPU&#8208;based TENG generates an open circuit voltage of 120&#160;V, a short circuit current of 7.5&#160;&#181;A and a transfer charge of 62 nC, representing a 4&#8208;fold increase compared to LiTFSI&#8208;doped WPU&#8208;based TENG. Consequently, the charge density reaches 155 &#181;C m&#8722;2, being the highest recorded for WPU&#8208;based and stretchable ionic conductive TENG. This work introduces a novel approach for boosting the output charge density while avoiding the adverse effect of ionic salt in solid conductors through a universal surfactant self&#8208;assembly strategy, which can be extended to other materials, such as polyvinyl alcohol. Further, the device was used to monitor and harvest the kinetic energy of human body motion.

         <title>Constructing An Interlaced Catalytic Surface Via Fluorine&#8208;doped Bimetallic Oxides for Oxygen Electrode Processes in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, renowned for their exceptionally high theoretical energy density, have garnered significant interest as a prime candidate for future electric device development. However, practical testing often yields unsatisfactory capacity due to the tendency of their solid&#8208;phase discharge products to cover active sites on the electrode surface. Optimizing the growth mechanism of these solid&#8208;phase products and addressing the storage issue to narrow the gap between actual and theoretical capacities stands as the core challenge in Li&#8211;O2 battery development. Here, a fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) with an interlaced catalytic surface (ICS) and an open, corncob&#8208;like structure is proposed as an oxygen electrode. Unlike conventional oxide electrodes with a &#8220;single adsorption catalytic mechanism&#8221;, the ICS of the CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC electrode offers a compelling &#8220;competitive adsorption catalytic mechanism&#8221;. This is attributed to the diverse selective sites within the ICS, where oxygen sites preferentially facilitate oxygen conversion due to their higher affinity for oxygen, while fluorine sites preferentially contribute to the growth of Li2O2 owing to their stronger affinity for LiO2. This transformation in the formation mechanism of Li2O2 and its morphology from film along the electrode surface to toroidal particles effectively mitigates the issue of buried active sites. Additionally, the unique structure of the CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC electrode aids in the storage and decomposition of Li2O2 products. Its corncob&#8208;like open architecture not only promotes the capture and release of oxygen but also facilitates the formation of well&#8208;contacted Li2O2/electrode interfaces, akin to a &#8220;corn on the cob&#8221; design. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery employing the CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of up to 30923 mAh g&#8211;1 and a lifespan exceeding 580 cycles, surpassing most reported metal oxide&#8208;based cathodes. This work offers a promising solution to the issues of buried active sites and storage of insoluble products in metal&#8208;air batteries.

Abstract
The special properties of rare earth elements have effectively broadened their application fields. How to accurately recognize and efficiently separate target rare earth ions with similar radii and chemical properties remains a formidable challenge. Here, we constructed precise two&#8208;dimensional (2D) heterogeneous channels using engineered E. coli membranes between graphene oxidse (GO) layers. The difference in binding ability and corresponding conformational change between Lanmodulin (LanM) and rare earth ions in the heterogeneous channel allow for precisely recognizing and sieving of scandium ions (Sc3+). The engineered E. coli membranes not only can protect the integrity of structure and functionality of LanM, the rich lipids and sugars but also help the E. coli membranes closely tile on the GO nanosheets through interaction, preventing swelling and controlling interlayer spacing accurately down to the sub&#8208;nanometer. Apparently, the 2D heterogeneous channels showcase excellent selectivity for trivalent ions (SFFe3+/Sc3+&#8776;3), especially for Sc3+ ions in rare earth elements with a high selectivity (SFCe/Sc&#8776;167, SFLa/Sc&#8776;103). The long&#8208;term stability and tensile strain tests verify the membrane's outstanding stability. Thus, this simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective work provides a suggestion for constructing two&#8208;dimensional interlayer heterogeneous channels for precise sieving, and the valuable strategy is proposed for the efficient extraction of Sc.

Abstract
As a central metabolic molecule, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can potentially treat acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, its bioavailability is poor due to short half&#8208;life, instability, the deficiency of targeting, and difficulties in transmembrane transport. Here we designed a physiologically adaptive gallic acid&#8208;NAD+ nanoparticle, that had ultrasmall size and pH&#8208;responsiveness, passed through the glomerular filtration membrane to reach injured renal tubules, and efficiently delivered NAD+ into the kidneys. With an effective accumulation in the kidneys, it restored renal function, immune microenvironment homeostasis, and mitochondrial homeostasis of AKI mice via the NAD+&#8208;Sirt1 axis, and exerted strong antifibrotic effects on the AKI&#8208;to&#8208;CKD transition by inhibiting TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling. It also exhibited excellent stability, biodegradable, and biocompatible properties, ensuring its long&#8208;term safety, practicality, and clinical translational feasibility. The present study shows a potential modality of mitochondrial repair and immunomodulation through nanoagents for the efficient and safe treatment of AKI and CKD.

         <title>Biologicals and Biomaterials for Corneal Regeneration and Vision Restoration in Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scaffolds with stem cells to rehabilitate the ocular surface in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency. Native and synthetic scaffolds, as carriers of stem cells, are being developed and transplanted to treat individuals with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Successful outcomes include restoration of tissue architecture and improvements in ocular health and vision without causing complications.








Abstract
The mammalian cornea is decorated with stem cells bestowed with the life&#8208;long task of renewing the epithelium, provided they remain healthy, functional, and in sufficient numbers. If not, a debilitating disease known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) can develop causing blindness. Decades after the first stem cell (SC) therapy is devised to treat this condition, patients continue to suffer unacceptable failures. During this time, improvements to therapeutics have included identifying better markers to isolate robust SC populations and nurturing them on crudely modified biological or biomaterial scaffolds including human amniotic membrane, fibrin, and contact lenses, prior to their delivery. Researchers are now gathering information about the biomolecular and biomechanical properties of the corneal SC niche to decipher what biological and/or synthetic materials can be incorporated into these carriers. Advances in biomedical engineering including electrospinning and 3D bioprinting with surface functionalization and micropatterning, and self&#8208;assembly models, have generated a wealth of biocompatible, biodegradable, integrating scaffolds to choose from, some of which are being tested for their SC delivery capacity in the hope of improving clinical outcomes for patients with LSCD.

         <title>Promotion of Probabilistic Bit Generation in Mott Devices by Embedded Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the pump&#8211;probe pulse inputs can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of switchable domains in VO2 Mott switches. The study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.








Abstract
Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two&#8208;terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p&#8208;bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p&#8208;bit generation. Herein, it is demonstrated that the randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8211;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO2 Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt&#8208;NP&#8208;containing VO2 threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p&#8208;bit operation (e.g., up to &#8776;300% increase in &#916;Vprobe upon going from (Pt NP/VO2)0 to (Pt NP/VO2)11) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit s&#8722;1), low power consumption (14 nJ per bit), and high stability (&gt;105&#160;200 bits) for p&#8208;bit generation. Thus, the study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

         <title>4D Printing for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews four&#8208;dimensional (4D) (bio&#8208;)printing, highlighting its application in biomedical engineering for developing medical devices (e.g., stents, microneedles (MNs), and implants). It further explores smart biomaterials, external stimuli, and design strategies essential for the success of 4D printing. Additionally, it discusses future research directions, including in vivo tissue regeneration and machine learning&#8208;based modeling to predict the behavior of 4D printed constructs.








Abstract
4D (bio&#8208;)printing endows 3D printed (bio&#8208;)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, microneedles, smart 3D&#8208;cell engineered microenvironments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi&#8208;)stimuli. Here, this work first highlights the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio&#8208;)printing. Then, it presents a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discusses the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including in vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape&#8208;transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning&#8208;based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8211;property and design&#8211;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm&#8208;Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract
Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high&#8208;fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film has been regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to be simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto&#8208;electrical property. Here, we report a 40&#160;nm&#8208;thick film based on photolithographic double&#8208;network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improving opto&#8208;electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&#8722;1 @ &gt; 90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8208;&#960;, electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. We further apply the film onto corrugated facial skin, monitor the subtle electromyogram, and perform machine learning algorithm to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high-fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film has been regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to be simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto-electrical property. Here, we report a 40&#160;nm-thick film based on photolithographic double-network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improving opto-electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; @ &amp;gt; 90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;-&#960;, electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. We further apply the film onto corrugated facial skin, monitor the subtle electromyogram, and perform machine learning algorithm to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Vivo Polymer Mechanochemistry with Polynucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical force to activate latent functionalities in macromolecules and widely relies on ultrasonication techniques. Fundamental constraints of frequency and power intensity have prohibited the application of the polymer mechanochemistry principles in a biomedical context up to now, although medical ultrasound is a clinically established modality. Here, a universal polynucleotide framework is presented that allows the binding and release of therapeutic oligonucleotides, both DNA&#8208; and RNA&#8208;based, as cargo by biocompatible medical imaging ultrasound. It is shown that the high molar mass, colloidal assembly, and a distinct mechanochemical mechanism enable the force&#8208;induced release of cargo and subsequent activation of biological function in vitro and in vivo. Thereby, we introduce a platform for the exploration of biological questions and therapeutics development steered by mechanical force.

         <title>Precisely Controlling Polymer Acceptors with Weak Intramolecular Charge Transfer Effect and Superior Coplanarity for Efficient Indoor All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 27% Efficiency.</title>

Abstract
Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are garnering increasing attention from both the academic and industrial communities due to the pressing demand of the ecosystem of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), emerging as a sub&#8208;type of organic photovoltaics, with the merits of great film&#8208;forming property, remarkable morphological and light stability, hold great promise to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term operation in IPV's application. However, the dearth of polymer acceptors with medium&#8208;bandgap has impeded the rapid development of indoor all&#8208;PSCs. Herein, we report a highly efficient medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor (PYFO&#8208;V) through the synergistic effects of side chain engineering and linkage modulation and apply it for indoor all&#8208;PSCs operation. As a result, the PM6:PYFO&#8208;V&#8208;based indoor all&#8208;PSC yielded a highest efficiency of 27.1% under LED light conditions, marking the highest value for reported binary indoor all&#8208;PSCs to date. More importantly, the blade coated devices using non&#8208;halogenated solvent (o&#8208;xylene) maintained an efficiency over 23%, demonstrating the potential for industry&#8208;scale fabrication. Our work not only highlights the importance of fine&#8208;tuning intramolecular charge transfer effect and intrachain coplanarity in developing high&#8208;performance medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors, but also provides a highly efficient strategy for indoor all&#8208;PSC application.

         <title>Bistable Electrochromic Ionogels via Supramolecular Interactions for Energy&#8208;Efficient Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy leveraging supramolecular interactions is proposed for designing bistable electrochromic materials, facilitating reversible color transitions, stabilizing the colored structure, and enabling spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion for bistable electrochromism. Utilizing biobased building blocks, reusable ITO electrodes, and ionogel functional layers, this approach achieves a flexible, energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable EC displays with excellent bistability.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic (EC) materials and systems offer significant potential for building decarbonization through their optical modulation and energy efficiency. However, challenges such as limited design strategies and bottlenecks in cost, fabrication, and color have hindered the full commercialization of energy&#8208;saving EC windows and displays, with few materials achieving true bistability. Herein, a novel strategy for designing bistable electrochromic materials is proposed by leveraging supramolecular interactions. These interactions facilitate reversible color transitions, stabilize the colored structure, and enable spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion, thereby achieving bistable electrochromism. The mechanisms and materials underlying these unconventional electrochromic systems are substantiated through detailed characterization. This strategy enables the preparation of low&#8208;cost and sustainable transparent electrochromic displays with high performance. Notably, the display information remains clearly visible for more than 2 h without consuming energy. Involving biomass materials and removable device structures also enhances the sustainability and scalability of EC technology applications and development. These results demonstrate the crucial role of supramolecular chemistry in the development of cutting&#8208;edge materials for applications such as energy&#8208;saving smart windows.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Tracking Topological Phase Transition Dynamics of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological phase transition dynamics of polar vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs under thermal and electric fields are revealed at the atomic scale using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Upon heating, no dissociation&#8208;like behavior of polar V&#8208;AV pairs is observed, and the antivortex disappears prior to the vortex. Electric fields can facilitate the approach of adjacent vortex and antivortex cores, leading to their annihilation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;trivial topological structures, such as vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs, have garnered significant attention in the field of condensed matter physics. However, the detailed topological phase transition dynamics of V&#8208;AV pairs, encompassing behaviors like self&#8208;annihilation, motion, and dissociation, have remained elusive in real space. Here, polar V&#8208;AV pairs are employed as a model system, and their transition pathways are tracked with atomic&#8208;scale resolution, facilitated by in situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and phase field simulations. This investigation reveals that polar vortices and antivortices can stably coexist as bound pairs at room temperature, and their polarization decreases with heating. No dissociation behavior is observed between the V&#8208;AV phase at room temperature and the paraelectric phase at high temperature. However, the application of electric fields can promote the approach of vortex and antivortex cores, ultimately leading to their annihilation near the interface. Revealing the transition process mediated by polar V&#8208;AV pairs at the atomic scale, particularly the role of polar antivortex, provides new insights into understanding the topological phases of matter and their topological phase transitions. Moreover, the detailed exploration of the dynamics of polar V&#8208;AV pairs under thermal and electrical fields lays a solid foundation for their potential applications in electronic devices.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ferroelectret Fabrication, Performance Optimization, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectrets demonstrate remarkable flexibility and piezoelectricity attributed to the formation of macrodipoles within the internal cavities of porous dielectric films upon polarization. This article provides a comprehensive review of ferroelectret fabrication techniques with different cavity structures, models for predicting piezoelectric coefficients, methods for enhancing performance, diverse applications, and future trends for large&#8208;scale preparation and integration with wearable systems.








Abstract
The growing demand for wearable devices has sparked a significant interest in ferroelectret films. They possess flexibility and exceptional piezoelectric properties due to strong macroscopic dipoles formed by charges trapped at the interface of their internal cavities. This review of ferroelectrets focuses on the latest progress in fabrication techniques for high temperature resistant ferroelectrets with regular and engineered cavities, strategies for optimizing their piezoelectric performance, and novel applications. The charging mechanisms of bipolar and unipolar ferroelectrets with closed and open&#8208;cavity structures are explained first. Next, the preparation and piezoelectric behavior of ferroelectret films with closed, open, and regular cavity structures using various materials are discussed. Three widely used models for predicting the piezoelectric coefficients (d33) are outlined. Methods for enhancing the piezoelectric performance such as optimized cavity design, utilization of fabric electrodes, injection of additional ions, application of DC bias voltage, and synergy of foam structure and ferroelectric effect are illustrated. A variety of applications of ferroelectret films in acoustic devices, wearable monitors, pressure sensors, and energy harvesters are presented. Finally, the future development trends of ferroelectrets toward fabrication and performance optimization are summarized along with its potential for integration with intelligent systems and large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Instantaneous Thermal Energy for Swift Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Unparalleled Performance in Metal&#8211;Air Batteries and Fuel Cells</title>

This research presents an innovative method, using a 2.5&#8208;min heat treatment, to create highly efficient iron single&#8208;atom catalysts supported by graphene oxide.








Abstract
Based on experimental and computational evidence, phthalocyanine (Pc) compounds in the form of quaternary&#8208;bound metal&#8208;nitrogen (N) atoms are the most effective catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the heat treatment process used in their synthesis may compromise the ideal structure, causing the agglomeration of transition metals. To overcome this issue, a novel method is developed for synthesizing iron (Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts with ideal structures supported by thermally exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). This is achieved through a short heat treatment of only 2.5&#160;min involving FePc and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide in the presence of GO. According to the synthesis mechanism revealed by this study, carbon monoxide acts as a strong linker between the single Fe atoms and graphene. It facilitates the formation of a structure containing oxygen species between FeN4 and graphene, which provides high activity and stability for the ORR. These catalysts possess an enormous number of active sites and exhibit enhanced activity toward the alkaline ORR. They demonstrate excellent performance when applied to real electrochemical devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries and anion exchange membrane fuel cells. It is expected that the instantaneous heat treatment method developed in this study will aid in the development of high&#8208;performing single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite&#8208;Based Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent recombination layers for two&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells are reviewed, including their fundamental functions, photophysical mechanisms, working principles, requirements, and characterization methods. Existing challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Two&#8208;terminal (2T) perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) arouse burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (S&#8211;Q) limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8211;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs are presented. The insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite&#8208;based two&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction TSCs, are also highlighted. Finally, the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on are summarized.

         <title>The Critical Analysis of Membranes toward Sustainable and Efficient Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are considered to be promising for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy with safety, flexibility, and durability. This review analyzes how key parameters of membranes that are critical components in VRFBs influence the device performance. Insights into design strategies for membranes for efficient VRFB are provided.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are a promising technology for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy, combining safety, high capacity, ease of scalability, and prolonged durability; features which have triggered their early commercial implementation. Furthering the deployment of VRFB technologies requires addressing challenges associated to a pivotal component: the membrane. Examples include vanadium crossover, insufficient conductivity, escalated costs, and sustainability concerns related to the widespread adoption of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;based membranes, e.g., perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;performance and sustainable membranes for VRFB, offering insights into prospective research directions to overcome these challenges, are reviewed. The analysis reveals the disparities and trade&#8208;offs between performance advances enabled by PFSA membranes and composites, and the lack of sustainability in their final applications. The potential of PFSA&#8208;free membranes and present strategies to enhance their performance are discussed. This study delves into vital membrane parameters to enhance battery performance, suggesting protocols and design strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance and sustainable VRFB membranes.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exhibiting BT.2020 Color Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#160;molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporating multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission, narrow spectra, and high reverse intersystem crossing&#160;rate. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode fabricated with the designed molecule records maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#160;coordinates of (0.163, 0.046).








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra&#8208;high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand&#8208;fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF&#8208;assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.

&lt;p&gt;Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non-emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra-high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep-blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep-blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long- and short-range charge-transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep-blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand-fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF-assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep-blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room Temperature Reduction of Nitrogen Oxide on Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking a natural enzyme, a sustainable, reducible iron MOF is able to selectively decompose NO
and NO2 into N2 and O2 in ambient conditions, without any reducing agent. This contributes to solve a long&#8208;standing problem in air purification and emissions control, opens new perspectives in heterogeneous catalysis and bridges the gap between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Nitrogen oxides represent one of the main threats for the environment. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, a sustainable solution for NOx removal under environmental conditions is still undefined. Using theoretical modelling, material design, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art investigation methods and mimicking enzymes, it is found that selected porous hybrid iron(II/III) based MOF material are able to decompose NOx, at room temperature, in the presence of water and oxygen, into N2 and O2 and without reducing agents. This paves the way to the development of new highly sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to improve air quality.

         <title>Toward 1D Transport in 3D Materials: SOC&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transport Anisotropy in Sm3ZrBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mechanistically induces 1D charge transport in the bulk, 3D structure Ln3ZrPn5 (Ln = La, Sm; Pn = Sb, Bi). Anisotropic charge transport measurements and electronic structure calculations demonstrate how the anisotropic 3D Fermi Surface of the antimonide is dimensionally reduced to 1D sheets of electron density in the bismuthides.








Abstract
1D charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, it is demonstrated that spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi&#8208;1D charge transport in the Ln3MPn5 (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi&#8208;1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8776;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8776;9.5 and &#8776;22 (&#8776;32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin&#8208;orbit coupling to induce quasi&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.

         <title>Carbonated Beverage Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative approach using Cola&#8208;like supersaturated CO2 for interface upgrading is proposed to stabilize 4.8&#160;V polycrystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, and it is also generalized to high&#8208;voltage single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2. 4.8 V NCM811 delivers an ultra&#8208;high capacity over 235&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and cathode energy over 900 W h kg&#8722;1 and retains &#8776;90% capacity over 100 cycles.








Abstract
Advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilize high upper cut&#8208;off voltages up to 4.8&#160;V versus lithium metal to reach extraordinary energy densities. Such a harsh environment challenges the cathode stability and requires the construction of robust cathode electrolyte interphases at their electrochemical interface. Inspired by carbonated beverages with supersaturated CO2, here, a surface modification strategy that produces effective passivation layer of low modulus from the weakest link, is proposed CO2 bubbles preferentially nucleate and grow at rough surfaces, which in oxide cathodes, are also the local regions offering fast degradation pathway. Metal ion exchange on carbonated layer assists the construction of highly elastic interface under the guidance of packing factor. This method enables surface reconstruction at both primary and secondary particle levels for various cathodes exemplified by high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and LiCoO2 (LCO). Remarkably, with ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8&#160;V versus Li+/Li, over 235 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity, and over 900&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 discharge energy at cathode level, &#8776;90% capacity retention can be obtained for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C with commercial carbonate electrolytes. This carbonated beverage chemistry is promising for constructing high&#8208;quality surface passivation in many extreme&#8208;condition applications beyond battery cathodes.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) was developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy was further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT could be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to a bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveiled the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrated distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>Synergistic Bulk and Surface Engineering for Expeditious and Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Air Electrode</title>

Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) offer the potential for high&#8208;efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R&#8208;PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk&#8208;phase metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in&#8208;situ formation of a metal oxide nano&#8208;catalyst surface modification. This strategy is designed to expedite the ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of air electrodes exhibiting triple (O2&#8722;, H+, e&#8722;) conductivity. Specifically, our engineered air electrode nanocomposite&#8208;Ba(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05F0.1O2.9&#8208;&#948; demonstrates remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity and exceptional durability in R&#8208;PCECs. This is evidenced by significantly improved peak power density from 626&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 to 996&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and highly stable reversibility over a 100&#8208;hour cycling period. This research offers a rational design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance R&#8208;PCEC air electrodes with superior operational activity and stability for efficient and sustainable energy conversion and storage.

&lt;p&gt;Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R-PCECs) offer the potential for high-efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R-PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk-phase metal-oxygen bonds and in-situ formation of a metal oxide nano-catalyst surface modification.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation into Charge Carriers in Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibit a high round&#8208;trip efficiency attributable to the assistance of light&#8208;generated electrons and holes in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Nonetheless, the excitonic effect arising from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes impedes carrier separation, thus hindering efficient utilization of photo&#8208;energy. Herein, porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks with (Fe2Ni)O(COO)6 clusters were used as photocathodes to accelerate exciton dissociation into charge carriers for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The coupling of Ni 3d and Fe 3d orbitals boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer, and hence drives exciton dissociation and activates O2 for superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;) radicals, rather than singlet oxygen (1O2) under photoexcitation. These enable the light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28&#160;V and round&#8208;trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Mechanochemically Robust LiCoO2 with Ultrahigh Capacity and Prolonged Cyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pushing intercalation&#8208;type cathode materials to their theoretical capacity often suffers from fragile Li&#8208;deficient frameworks and severe lattice strain, leading to mechanical failure issues within the crystal structure and fast capacity fading. This is particularly pronounced in layered oxide cathodes because the intrinsic nature of their structures is susceptible to structural degradation with excessive Li extraction, which remains unsolved yet despite attempts involving elemental doping and surface coating strategies. Herein, we develop a mechanochemical strengthening strategy through gradient disordering structure to address these challenges and push the LiCoO2 layered cathode approaching the capacity limit (256 mAh g&#8722;1, up to 93% of Li utilization). This innovative approach also demonstrates exceptional cyclability and rate capability, as validated in practical Ah&#8208;level pouch full cells, surpassing the current performance benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations with multiscale X&#8208;ray, electron diffraction and imaging techniques unveil that the gradient disordering structure notably diminishes the anisotropic lattice strain and exhibits high fatigue resistance, even under extreme delithiation states and harsh operating voltages. Consequently, our designed LiCoO2 cathode impedes the growth and propagation of particle cracks, and mitigates irreversible phase transitions. This work sheds light on promising directions towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery materials through structural chemistry design.

Abstract
Citrate&#8208;based biodegradable polymers have emerged as a distinctive biomaterial platform with tremendous potential for diverse medical applications. By harnessing their versatile chemistry, these polymers exhibit a wide range of material and bioactive properties, enabling them to regulate cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation through energy metabolism, metabonegenesis, angiogenesis and immunomodulation. Moreover, the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the biodegradable poly(octamethylene citrate) (POC)/hydroxyapatite&#8208;based orthopedic fixation devices represent a translational research milestone for biomaterial science. POC joins a short list of biodegradable synthetic polymers that have ever been authorized by the FDA for use in humans. The clinical success of POC has sparked enthusiasm and accelerated the development of next&#8208;generation citrate&#8208;based biomaterials. This review presents a comprehensive, forward&#8208;thinking discussion on the pivotal role of citrate chemistry and metabolism in various tissue regeneration and on the development of functional citrate&#8208;based metabotissugenic biomaterials for regenerative engineering applications.

         <title>Full&#8208;Space Electric Field in Mo&#8208;Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the challenge of inadequate charge kinetics within the photocatalyst, this work has induced a sophisticated full&#8208;space electric field in an atomically dispersed Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5, resulting in a substantial boost in charge separation efficiency and a streamlined charge flow, thereby paving the way for a highly&#8208;efficient artificial photosynthesis process.








Abstract
Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H2 fuel and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, this work overcomes this limitation by inducing the full&#8208;space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5 (Mo&#8208;Zn2In2S5) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full&#8208;space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn2In2S5. Notably, the optimized Mo1.5&#8208;Zn2In2S5 catalyst achieves exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn2S4 by 3.83&#8208; and 4.15&#8208;fold. These findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Single Dispersion of Fe(H2O)2&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Biomimetic CH4 Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined Fe single&#8208;site catalyst is constructed by uniformly dispersing nanosized molecular cluster on the polymeric carbon nitride support. The well&#8208;defined (WO)4&#8208;Fea(H2O)2 site can not only act as active site for dramatically boosting methane&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, but also serves as the model with precise structure for the investigating enzyme&#8208;like catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Direct methane conversion to value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions with in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K9Na2Fe(H2O)2{[&#947;&#8208;SiW9O34Fe(H2O)]}2&#183;25H2O polyoxometalate (Fe&#8208;POM) with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment toward CH4 photooxidation. The Fe&#8208;POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH4 to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1 and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H2O)SiW11O39]5&#8722; with Fe(H2O) active site, [Fe2SiW10O38(OH)]214&#8722; and [P8W48O184Fe16(OH)28(H2O)4]20&#8722; with multinuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single&#8208;dispersion of Fe&#8208;POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single&#8208;cluster functionalized PCN with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)4&#8722;Fe(H2O)2 can supply Fe&#9552;O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)4&#8722;Fea&#8722;Ot&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 intermediate, similar to that for CH4 oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of &#8776;1&#8211;2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well&#8208;defined model for in&#8208;depth mechanism research.

         <title>Nonpersistent Nanoarchitectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpersistent nanoarchitectures comprising cluster&#8208;size gold demonstrate, in combination with radiotherapy, an outperforming therapeutic efficacy on orthotopic human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck squamous cell carcinoma immunocompetent murine models. This approach overcomes the clinical limitations associated to metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated radiotherapy while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to the gold standard, opening new horizons in oral cancer management.









Abstract
Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing locally advanced human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long&#8208;time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post&#8208;treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard&#8208;dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape, and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, it is demonstrated that a new model of nonpersistent gold nanoarchitectures containing cisplatin (NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor&#8208;reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persist for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NP&#8208;based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, these data support the exploiting of nonpersistent metal&#8208;nanomaterial&#8208;mediated approaches for oral cancer management.

         <title>Thickness of Nanoscale Poly(Dimethylsiloxane) Layers Determines the Motion of Sliding Water Drops</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydimethylsiloxane brushes are extensively utilized in material applications as a hydrophobic coating due to the low liquid drop friction and high stability. However, the drop movements still vary depending on how it is prepared. In this work, the film thickness is proved to be a determinant for the water drop dynamic friction on such kind of a surface.








Abstract
Layers of nanometer thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are applied as hydrophobic coatings because of their environmentally friendly and chemically inert properties. In applications such as heat exchangers or fog harvesting, low water drop friction on surfaces is required. While the onset of motion (static friction) has been studied, the knowledge of dynamic friction needs to be improved. To minimize drop friction, it is essential to understand which processes lead to energy dissipation and cause dynamic friction? Here, the dynamic friction of drops on PDMS brushes of different thicknesses is measured, covering the whole available velocity regime. The brush thickness L turns out to be a predictor for drop friction. 4&#8211;5&#160;nm thick PDMS brush shows the lowest dynamic friction. A certain minimal thickness is necessary to form homogeneous surfaces and reduce the attractive van der Waals interaction between water and the substrate. The increase in dynamic friction above L = 5&#160;nm is also attributed to the increasing viscoelastic dissipation of the capillary ridge formed at the contact line. The height of the ridge is related to the brush thickness. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force measurements support this interpretation. Sum&#8208;frequency generation further indicates a maximum order at the PDMS&#8211;water interface at intermediate thickness.

         <title>Planar Chlorination Engineering: A Strategy of Completely Breaking the Geometric Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 Site for Boosting Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is successfully designed by &#8220;NaCl&#8208;co&#8208;pyrolysis&#8221; strategy, which completely breaks the geometric symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activities for both oxygen electroreduction and Zn&#8208;air battery test than traditional Fe&#8208;N4 catalyst, revealing the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion devices.








Abstract
Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is first proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49 and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe&#8208;N4/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst also has excellent stability for 25&#160;000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn&#8208;air battery test, the Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst has the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8211;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the adjacent C&#9472;Cl bond effectively breaks the symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site, downward shifts the d&#8208;band center of Fe, facilitates the reduction and release of OH*, and remarkably lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. This work reveals the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.

&lt;p&gt;The planar chlorination engineering of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site is successfully designed by &#8220;NaCl-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-pyrolysis&#8221; strategy, which completely breaks the geometric symmetry of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site. The Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CNCl catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activities for both oxygen electroreduction and Zn-air battery test than traditional Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, revealing the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site is first proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibits a half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49 and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CNCl catalyst also has excellent stability for 25&#160;000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn-air battery test, the Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CNCl catalyst has the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8211;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt-based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the adjacent C&#9472;Cl bond effectively breaks the symmetry of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site, downward shifts the d-band center of Fe, facilitates the reduction and release of OH&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkably lowers the energy barrier of rate-determining step. This work reveals the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Chiral Calcium Silicate Hydrate Films Promote Vascularization for Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium silicate hydrate films with levorotatory chirality promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis by activating integrin receptors and mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4. This process enhances vascularization at the enthesis and eventually promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rat rotator cuff tear models, underscoring the potential of chiral biomaterials for tissue regeneration via revascularization.








Abstract
Revascularization after rotator cuff repair is crucial for tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing. The chirality of materials has been reported to influence their performance in tissue repair. However, data on the use of chiral structures to optimize biomaterials as a revascularization strategy remain scarce. Here, calcium silicate hydrate (CSO) films with hierarchical chirality on the atomic to micrometer scale are developed. Interestingly, levorotatory CSO (L&#8208;CSO) films promote the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, whereas dextral and racemic CSO films do not induce the same effects. Molecular analysis demonstrates that L&#8208;chirality can be recognized by integrin receptors and leads to the formation of focal adhesion, which activates mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 to conduct Ca2+ influx. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serum response factor is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis. After implanted in a rat rotator cuff tear model, L&#8208;CSO films strongly enhance vascularization at the enthesis, promoting collagen maturation, increasing bone and fibrocartilage formation, and eventually improving the biomechanical strength. This study reveals the mechanism through which chirality influences angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provides a critical theoretical foundation for the clinical application of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Acoustic Metagrating Holograms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D space is studied. Through this analysis, a series of holograms generated by dual&#8208;layer acoustic metagratings is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently.








Abstract
Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in&#8208;plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher&#8208;order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings demonstrate an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL remains limited to 1D metagratings, unable to access 2D holographic images in 3D spaces. Here, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces is investigated. Through this analysis, a series of acoustic metagrating holograms is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently. This study introduces an additional dimension to modern holography design and metasurface wavefront manipulation.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite Nanograin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes in Green&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Gamut with Co&#8208;Additive Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient perovskite nanograin light&#8208;emitting diodes, presenting champion external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 28.4%, 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% at 521, 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17.5&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color, are reported. The performances compare favorably with or exceed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices ever reported.








Abstract
Perovskite nanograins exceeding the Bohr exciton diameter show great potential for high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their bandgap homogeneity, spatial charge confinement, and nonlocal interaction. However, it is challenging to directly synthesize proper nanograins along with reduced crystal defects on functional substrate, and the corresponding high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) have rarely been reported. In this study, crystallization modulation for perovskites with an effective co&#8208;additive system, including lithium bromide, p&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide, and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, is performed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed co&#8208;additive system can synergistically retard perovskite crystallization and reduce crystal defects. Consequently, high&#8208;quality perovskite nanograin solids (&#8776;22.8&#160;nm) are obtained with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8776;88%). These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co&#8208;additive system can be universally applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. These results supplement the research on high&#8208;efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Binary&#8208;Phase on Structural Stability of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces the relationship between different phase ratios in cathode materials and their electrochemical properties for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showing that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. Combines with different characterizations, optional Na0.76Cu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 cathode material with reasonable phase ratios can effectively alleviate the degree of phase transformation under voltage, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The emergence of layered sodium transition metal oxides featuring a multiphase structure presents a promising approach for cathode materials in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showcasing notably improved energy storage capacity. However, the advancement of cathodes with multiphase structures faces obstacles due to the limited understanding of the integrated structural effects. Herein, the integrated structural effects by an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;chemistry analysis in the developed layered cathode system NaxCu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 with purposely designed P2/O3 phase integration, are comprehended. The results affirm that integrated phase ratio plays a pivotal role in electrochemical/structural stability, particularly at high voltage and with the incorporation of anionic redox. In contrast to previous reports advocating solely for the enhanced electrochemical performance in biphasic structures, it is demonstrated that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results, coupled with density functional theory computations further confirm that the biphasic structure with P2:O3 = 4:6 shows suppressed irreversible phase transition at high desodiated states and thus exhibits optimized electrochemical performance. These fundamental discoveries provide clues to the design of high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa Intermetallic Nanocatalysts with Enhanced Methanol Oxidation Performance for Efficient Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticle electrocatalyst is designed, which shows outstanding performance for the methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline&#8211;saline water. Stable energy&#8208;saving hybrid seawater electrolysis is further demonstrated, using the prepared Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa nanoparticles to catalyze the anodic methanol oxidation coupled with the cathodic hydrogen evolution, which completely circumvents the interfering chlorine evolution.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduce the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents ClER. To this end, developing high&#8208;performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, a novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticle (i&#8208;NP) catalyst is reported, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mgPGM&#8722;1), a large specific activity (18.13&#160;mA cmPGM&#8722;2), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt2CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of synergistic OH&#8722; groups near Pd sites. MOR&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis is demonstrated, which continuously operates under 1.23&#160;V for 240&#160;h in simulated seawater and 120&#160;h in natural seawater without notable degradation.

         <title>Multicolor Inks of Black Phosphorus for Midwave&#8208;Infrared Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable process of black phosphorus&#8208;based ink films for multicolored optoelectronic device applications in mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. Through the reduction of black phosphorus particle size distribution, the optical bandgap systematically blueshifts, reaching up to 0.8&#160;eV (&#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m). Conversely, alloying black phosphorus with arsenic induces a redshift in the bandgap to 0.28&#160;eV (&#955; = 4.4&#160;&#181;m).








Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) based ink with a bulk bandgap of 0.33&#160;eV (&#955; = 3.7&#160;&#181;m) has recently been shown to be promising for large&#8208;area, high performance mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics. However, the development of multicolor bP inks expanding across the MWIR wavelength range has been challenging. Here a multicolor ink process based on bP with spectral emission tuned from 0.28&#160;eV (&#955; = 4.4&#160;&#181;m) to 0.8&#160;eV (&#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m) is demonstrated. Specifically, through the reduction of bP particle size distribution (i.e., lateral dimension and thickness), the optical bandgap systematically blueshifts, reaching up to 0.8&#160;eV. Conversely, alloying bP with arsenic (bP1&#8722;xAsx) induces a redshift in the bandgap to 0.28&#160;eV. The ink processed films are passivated with an infrared&#8208;transparent epoxy for stable infrared emission in ambient air. Utilizing these multicolor bP&#8208;based inks as an infrared light source, a gas sensing system is demonstrated that selectively detects gases, such as CO2 and CH4 whose absorption band varies around 4.3 and 3.3&#160;&#181;m, respectively. The presented ink formulation sets the stage for the advancement of multiplex MWIR optoelectronics, including spectrometers and spectral imaging using a low&#8208;cost material processing platform.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Larger Dipole Moments for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to obtain self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with good wettability, adsorbability, and compactness, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs are designed and synthesized with different dipole moments, namely IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibited a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for PSCs based on multipodal SAMs.








Abstract
In the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the wettability, adsorbability, and compactness of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on conductive substrates have critical impacts on the quality of the perovskite films and the defects at the buried perovskite&#8208;substrate interface, which control the efficiency and stability of the devices. Herein, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs, IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3, are designed and synthesized by modulating the position of the two nitrogen atoms of the IDCz unit to improve the molecular dipole moments and strengthen the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Regulating the work functions (WF) of FTO electrodes through molecular dipole moments and energy levels, the perovskite band bends upwards with a small offset for ITO/IDCz&#8208;3/perovskite, thereby promoting hole extraction and blocking electrons. As a result, the inverted PSC employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibits a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for the multipodal SAMs&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with IDCz&#8208;3 can be stored for at least 1800 h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Mott&#8211;Schottky Construction Boosted Plasmon Thermal and Electronic Effects on the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH Nanohybrids for Highly&#8208;Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction can lower the Fermi level/d&#8208;band center of Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G, and strengthen its plasmon effect. The plasmon thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), promote the deprotonation of *OOH, whereas the electronic effect increases the density of charge carriers, and lowers the activation energy of OER, thereby contributing to remarkable OER and overall&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performances.








Abstract
Mott&#8211;Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly&#8208;efficient and closely&#8208;linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well&#8208;designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it is found that the Mott&#8211;Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV&#8208;LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d&#8208;band center (from &#8722;0.89 to &#8722;0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31&#160;eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 to 1.64&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 cm&#8722;3), lower the activation energy of OER (from 30.3 to 17.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Benefiting from these favorable factors, the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G NHs show remarkable electrocatalytic performances, with an overpotential of 178 and 263&#160;mV to afford 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and a low cell voltage of 1.42&#160;V to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation.

         <title>Advanced Anti&#8208;Icing Strategies and Technologies by Macrostructured Photothermal Storage Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the cutting&#8208;edge progress of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;icing and proposes a unique concept of smart surfaces, termed the macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, for all&#8208;day efficient anti&#8208;icing. The MPSS surfaces integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic surfaces, photothermal materials, and energy storage materials, and shall be applied in diverse anti&#8208;icing scenarios.








Abstract
Water is the source of life and civilization, but water icing causes catastrophic damage to human life and diverse industrial processes. Currently, superhydrophobic surfaces (inspired by the lotus effect) aided anti&#8208;icing attracts intensive attention due to their energy&#8208;free property. Here, recent advances in anti&#8208;icing by design and functionalization of superhydrophobic surfaces are reviewed. The mechanisms and advantages of conventional, macrostructured, and photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are introduced in turn. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces, as well as macrostructured ones, easily lose the icephobic property under extreme conditions, while photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces strongly rely on solar illumination. To address the above issues, a potentially smart strategy is found by developing macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, which integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic materials, photothermal materials, and phase change materials (PCMs), and are expected to achieve all&#8208;day anti&#8208;icing in various fields. Finally, the latest achievements in developing MPSS surfaces, showcasing their immense potential, are highlighted. Besides, the perspectives on the future development of MPSS surfaces are provided and the problems that need to be solved in their practical applications are proposed.

         <title>Neutral Cyanine: Ultra&#8208;Stable NIR&#8208;II Merocyanines for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Tumor&#8208;Targeted Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II emissive neutral merocyanine dye is developed based on the clinically used ionic indocyanine green, exhibiting maintained strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, improved photostability, enhanced photothermal performance, bright NIR&#8208;II emission, and specific tumor accumulation. The mCy890 NPs are successfully utilized for efficient in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging and cancer phototheranostics.









Abstract
Fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8208;guided phototheranostics using emission from the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window show significant potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Clinical imaging&#8208;used polymethine ionic indocyanine green (ICG) dye is widely adopted for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) research due to its exceptional photophysical properties. However, ICG has limitations such as poor photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), short&#8208;wavelength emission peak, and liver&#8208;targeting issues, which restrict its wider use. In this study, two ionic ICG derivatives are transformed into neutral merocyanines (mCy) to achieve much&#8208;enhanced performance for NIR&#8208;II cancer phototheranostics. Initial designs of two ionic dyes show similar drawbacks as ICG in terms of poor photostability and low photothermal performance. One of the modified neutral molecules, mCy890, shows significantly improved stability, an emission peak over 1000&#160;nm, and a high photothermal PCE of 51%, all considerably outperform ICG. In vivo studies demonstrate that nanoparticles of the mCy890 can effectively accumulate at the tumor sites for cancer photothermal therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This research provides valuable insights into the development of neutral merocyanines for enhanced cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>Construction of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W at Interfaces of Phase&#8208;Mixed Cobalt Selenide via Spontaneous Phase Transition for Platinum&#8208;Like Hydrogen Evolution Activity and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
W doping induces a spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2. The nanoflower&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst benefits from Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species formed on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side of the phase interface and abundant phase interfaces, exhibiting Pt&#8208;like HER activity and outstanding stability in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective transition metal chalcogenides are highly promising electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, unsatisfactory HER kinetics and stability have severely hindered their applications in industrial water electrolysis. Herein, a nanoflowers&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst ((c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W) is reported. The W doping induces spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2, which not only enables precise regulation of the ratio of two phases but also realizes W doping at the interfaces of two phases. The (c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W catalyst exhibits a Pt&#8208;like HER activity in both alkaline and acidic media, with record&#8208;low HER overpotentials of 29.8&#160;mV (alkaline) and 35.9&#160;mV (acidic) at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, surpassing the vast majority of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic HER. The Pt&#8208;like HER activities originate from the formation of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side at the phase interface, which effectively modulates electron structures of active sites, not only enhancing H2O adsorption and dissociation at Co sites but also optimizing H* adsorption to &#916;GH*&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 at W sites. Benefiting from the abundant phase interfaces, the catalyst also displays outstanding long&#8208;term durability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>A Human&#8208;Scale Clinically Ready Electromagnetic Navigation System for Magnetically Responsive Biomaterials and Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic navigation systems (MNS) facilitate minimally invasive procedures but face cost and infrastructure constraints. The Navion, a portable electromagnetic system, addresses these issues by generating a large magnetic field and is easily deployable in hospitals. It aids in the adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments navigating various microstructures and catheters for medical procedures.








Abstract
Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. The study reports on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through health care facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, the design and implementation approach for the system are introduced and its performance is characterized. Next, in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures is demonstrated using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria&#8208;inspired helical structures are investigated. The navigation of magnetic catheters is also demonstrated in two challenging endovascular tasks: 1) an angiography procedure and 2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosensitizer&#8208;Amplified Antimicrobial Materials for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Ablation of Resistant Pathogens in Ocular Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photodynamic therapy agents combining nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazoles and their modular integration into peptide sequences for broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity is presented. Chemical optimization leads to PEP3 with strong phototoxicity against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria as well as fungi, including MDR pathogens, biofilms, and ex vivo porcine models of microbial keratitis.








Abstract
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug&#8208;resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of photodynamic therapy agents combining nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazoles and their modular integration into peptide sequences for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity is presented. Chemical optimization leads to &lt;b&gt;PEP3&lt;/b&gt; with strong phototoxicity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi, including MDR pathogens, biofilms, and ex vivo porcine models of microbial keratitis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug-resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens. In the present work, a new class of benzodiazole-paired materials is designed as highly potent PDT agents with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity upon illumination with nontoxic light. The results mechanistically demonstrate that the energy transfer and electron transfer between nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazole moieties embedded within pathogen-binding peptide sequences result in increased singlet oxygen generation and enhanced phototoxicity. Chemical optimization renders &lt;b&gt;PEP3&lt;/b&gt; as a novel PDT agent with remarkable activity against MDR bacteria and fungi as well as pathogens at different stages of development (e.g., biofilms, spores, and fungal hyphae), which also prove effective in an ex vivo porcine model of microbial keratitis. The chemical modularity of this strategy and its general compatibility with peptide-based targeting agents will accelerate the design of highly photosensitive materials for antimicrobial PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Palladium Hydride Surface Enabling Simultaneous Bacterial Killing and Osteogenic Formation through Proton Capturing and Activation of Antioxidant System in Immune Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride (PdHx) film, fabricated on titanium implants, exhibits a lattice capable of capturing protons within the bacterial microenvironment, consequently inducing bacterial death. Furthermore, it mimics human antioxidant systems, reshaping the osteogenic immune microenvironment and promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Achieving bacterial killing and osteogenic formation on an implant surface rarely occurs. In this study, a novel surface design&#8211;a palladium hydride (PdHx) film that enables these two distinct features to coexist is introduced. The PdHx lattice captures protons in the extracellular microenvironment of bacteria, disrupting their normal metabolic activities, such as ATP synthesis, nutrient co&#8208;transport, and oxidative stress. This disruption leads to significant bacterial death, as evidenced by RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, the unique enzymatic activity and hydrogen&#8208;loading properties of PdHx activate the human antioxidant system, resulting in the rapid clearance of reactive oxygen species. This process reshapes the osteogenic immune microenvironment, promoting accelerated osteogenesis. These findings reveal that the downregulation of the NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway is critical for activating immune cells toward M2 phenotype polarization. This novel surface design provides new strategies for modifying implant coatings to simultaneously prevent bacterial infection, reduce inflammation, and enhance tissue regeneration, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field of advanced materials.

         <title>Singular Hall Response from a Correlated Ferromagnetic Flat Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological quantum phases have been largely understood in weakly correlated systems, which have identified various quantum phenomena such as spin Hall effect, protected transport of helical fermions, and topological superconductivity. Robust ferromagnetic order in correlated topological materials particularly attracts attention, as it can provide a versatile platform for novel quantum devices. Here, we report singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a van der Waals ferromagnetic semimetal, Fe3GaTe2, with a high Curie temperature of Tc = 347 K. High anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperature, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient are observed in Fe3GaTe2, which implies heavy fermion features in this ferromagnetic topological material. Our scanning tunneling microscopy, circular dichroism in angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations support the original electronic features in the material. Thus, low&#8208;dimensional Fe3GaTe2 with electronic correlation, topology, and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic order appears to be a promising candidate for robust quantum devices.

         <title>3D Printing of Composite Radiation Shielding for Broad Spectrum Protection of Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The miniaturization of satellite systems has compounded the need to protect microelectronic components from damaging radiation. Current approaches to mitigate this damage, such as indiscriminate mass shielding, built&#8208;in redundancies, and radiation hardened electronics, introduce high size, weight, power, and cost penalties that impact the overall performance of the satellite or launch opportunities. Additive manufacturing provides an appealing strategy to deposit radiation shielding only on susceptible components within an electronic assembly. Here, we describe a versatile material platform and process to conformally print customized composite inks at room temperatures directly and selectively onto commercial&#8208;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf electronics. The suite of inks uses a flexible styrene&#8208;isoprene&#8208;styrene block copolymer binder that can be filled with particles of varying atomic densities for varying radiation shielding capabilities. Additionally, the system readily allows blended composites that contain multiple particle species with varying atomic composition within the same structure. The method can produce graded shielding that offers improved radiation attenuation via exquisite control over both shield geometry and composition. We anticipate this alternative to traditional shielding methods will enable the rapid proliferation of the next generation of compact satellite designs.

         <title>High&#8208;Color&#8208;Rendition White QLEDs by Balancing Red, Green and Blue Centres in Eco&#8208;Friendly ZnCuGaS:In@ZnS Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An In3+&#8208;doped strategy in ZnCuGaS@ZnS QDs to balance the carrier distribution among multi&#8208;centers is proposed. The In3+&#8208;doped tactics reduces the proportional variation among each luminescent center over time, and provides the possibility of realizing stable mono&#8208;component electro&#8208;white&#8208;luminescence.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are the key components in the next&#8208;generation lighting and display devices. The inherent toxicity of Cd/Pb&#8208;based quantum dots (QDs) limits the further application in WLEDs. Recently, more attention is focused on eco&#8208;friendly QDs and their WLEDs, especially the phosphor&#8208;free WLEDs based on mono&#8208;component, which profits from bias&#8208;insensitive color stability. However, the imbalanced carrier distribution between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue luminescent centers, even the absence of a certain luminescent center, hinders their balanced and stable photoluminescence/electroluminescence (PL/EL). Here, an In3+&#8208;doped strategy in Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ga&#8208;S@ZnS QDs is first proposed, and the balanced carrier distribution is realized by non&#8208;equivalent substitution and In3+ doping concentration modulation. The alleviation of the green emitter by the In3+&#8208;related red emitter and the compensation of blue emitter by the Zn&#8208;related electronic states contribute to the balanced red&#8208;green&#8208;blue emitting with high PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 95.3% and long lifetime (T90) of over 1100 h in atmospheric conditions. Thus, the In3+&#8208;doped WLEDs can achieve exceedingly slight proportional variations between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue EL intensity over time (&#8710;CIE = (0.007, 0.009)), and high champion CRI of 94.9. This study proposes a single&#8208;component QD with balanced and stable red&#8208;green&#8208;blue PL/EL spectrum, meeting the requirements of lighting and display.

         <title>Assembled/Disassembled Modular Scaffolds for Multicellular Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicellular tissue engineering scaffolds with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types are successfully constructed through the strategy of assembling 3D printed modules loaded with different kinds of cells. Assembled/disassembled modular scaffolds can not only be used for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross&#8208;talk, but also be utilized as cell&#8208;laden implants for the regeneration of complex tissue.








Abstract
The behavior of tissue resident cells can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of cellular interactions. Therefore, it is of significance to precisely control the spatial organization of various cells within multicellular constructs. It remains challenging to construct a versatile multicellular scaffold with ordered spatial organization of multiple cell types. Herein, a modular multicellular tissue engineering scaffold with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types is constructed by assembling varying cell&#8208;laden modules.

&lt;p&gt;Multicellular tissue engineering scaffolds with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types are successfully constructed through the strategy of assembling 3D printed modules loaded with different kinds of cells. Assembled/disassembled modular scaffolds can not only be used for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross-talk, but also be utilized as cell-laden implants for the regeneration of complex tissue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of tissue resident cells can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of cellular interactions. Therefore, it is of significance to precisely control the spatial organization of various cells within multicellular constructs. It remains challenging to construct a versatile multicellular scaffold with ordered spatial organization of multiple cell types. Herein, a modular multicellular tissue engineering scaffold with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types is constructed by assembling varying cell-laden modules. Interestingly, the modular scaffolds can be disassembled into individual modules to evaluate the specific contribution of each cell type in the system. Through assembling cell-laden modules, the macrophage-mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), endothelial cell-MSC, and chondrocyte-MSC co-culture models are successfully established. The in vitro results indicate that the intercellular cross-talk can promote the proliferation and differentiation of each cell type in the system. Moreover, MSCs in the modular scaffolds may regulate the behavior of chondrocytes through the nuclear factor of activated T-Cells (NFAT) signaling pathway. Furthermore, the modular scaffolds loaded with co-cultured chondrocyte-MSC exhibit enhanced regeneration ability of osteochondral tissue, compared with other groups. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy to construct a multicellular tissue engineering scaffold for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross-talk and complex tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Nanofiber Formation Blocks AXL and GAS6 Binding to Suppress Ovarian Cancer Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of in situ nanofiber formation is proposed to inhibit Anexelekto (AXL) signaling to efficiently suppress ovarian cancer development. After administration, Nap&#8208;IR specifically targets AXL on cancer cell membrane, followed by receptor&#8208;instructed nanoparticle&#8208;to&#8208;nanofiber transition. The formed nanofibers block AXL and growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6) binding to inhibit AXL and disrupt its downstream pathway events, leading to enhanced apoptosis of ovarian tumors.








Abstract
Anexelekto (AXL) is an attractive molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy because of its important role in ovarian cancer initiation and progression. To date, several AXL inhibitors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, the disadvantages of low AXL affinity and severe off&#8208;target toxicity of these inhibitors limit their further clinical applications. Herein, by rational design of a nonapeptide derivative Nap&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Glu&#8208;Ile&#8208;Arg&#8208;Leu&#8208;Arg&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys (Nap&#8208;IR), a strategy of in situ nanofiber formation is proposed to suppress ovarian cancer growth. After administration, Nap&#8208;IR specifically targets overexpressed AXL on ovarian cancer cell membranes and undergoes a receptor&#8208;instructed nanoparticle&#8208;to&#8208;nanofiber transition. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that in situ formed Nap&#8208;IR nanofibers efficiently induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by blocking AXL activation and disrupting subsequent downstream signaling events. Remarkably, Nap&#8208;IR can synergistically enhance the anticancer effect of cisplatin against HO8910 ovarian tumors. It is anticipated that the Nap&#8208;IR can be applied in clinical ovarian cancer therapy in the near future.

         <title>TSG6&#8208;Exo@CS/GP Attenuates Endometrium Fibrosis by Inhibiting Macrophage Activation in a Murine IUA Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The illustration depicts the therapeutic effectiveness of an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (CS/GP) loaded with TSG6&#8208;modified&#8208;Exos in an intrauterine adhesion model. The TSG6&#8208;Exo@CS/GP system enables sustained release of TSG6&#8208;modified&#8208;Exos, resulting in reduced levels of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 by inhibiting M1&#8208;like macrophages and inhibiting alpha&#8208;smooth muscle actin and collagen I expression owing to the activation of stromal fibroblasts, ultimately suppressing endometrium fibrosis.








Abstract
Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is characterized by the formation of fibrous scar tissue within the uterine cavity, which significantly impacts female reproductive health and even leads to infertility. Unfortunately, severe cases of IUA currently lack effective treatments. This study presents a novel approach that utilizes tumor necrosis factor&#8208;(TNF) stimulated gene 6 (TSG6)&#8208;modified exosomes (Exos) in conjunction with an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (CS/GP) to mitigate the occurrence of IUA by reducing endometrium fibrosis in a mouse IUA model. This study demonstrate that TSG6&#8208;modified Exos effectively inhibits the activation of inflammatory M1&#8208;like macrophages during the initial stages of inflammation and maintains the balance of macrophage phenotypes (M1/M2) during the repair phase. Moreover, TSG6 inhibits the interaction between macrophages and endometrial stromal fibroblasts, thereby preventing the activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, this research indicates that CS/GP facilitates the sustained release of TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, leading to a significant reduction in both the manifestations of IUA and the extent of endometrium fibrosis. Collectively, through the successful construction of CS/GP loaded with TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, a reduction in the occurrence and progression of IUA is achieved by mitigating endometrium fibrosis. Consequently, this approach holds promise for the treatment of IUA.

         <title>Ultrahigh Nonlinear Responses from MXene Plasmons in the Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an important discovery regarding the optical properties of MXenes, demonstrating that 2D Ti3C2Tx generates a strong plasmonic phenomenon in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared range through acoustic plasmon modes. Additionally, this finding is leveraged to achieve record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficients at short&#8208;wavelength infrared wavelengths.








Abstract
Surface plasmons in 2D materials such as graphene exhibit exceptional field confinement. However, the low electron density of majority of 2D materials, which are semiconductors or semimetals, has limited their plasmons to mid&#8208;wave or long&#8208;wave infrared regime. This study demonstrates that a 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene with high electron density can not only support strong plasmon confinement with an acoustic plasmon mode in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, but also provide ultrahigh nonlinear responses. The acoustic MXene plasmons (AMPs) in the MXene (Ti3C2Tx)&#8211;insulator (SiO2)&#8211;metal (Au) nanostructure generate in the 1.5&#8211;6.0 &#181;m wavelength range, exhibiting a two orders of magnitude reduction in wavelength compared to wavelength in free space. Furthermore, AMP resonators with patterned Au rods exhibit a record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficient of 1.37 &#215; 10&#8722;2 m&#160;W&#8722;1 at wavelength of 1.56 &#181;m, &#8776;3 orders of magnitude greater than the highest value recorded for other 2D materials. These results indicate that MXenes can overcome fundamental plasmon wavelength limitations of previously studied 2D materials, providing groundbreaking opportunities in nonlinear optical applications, including all&#8208;optical processing and ultrafast optical switching.

         <title>TiO2 Nano&#8208;Biopatterning Reveals Optimal Ligand Presentation for Cell&#8211;Matrix Adhesion Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric nano&#8208;biopatterning technology is developed, enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy that is not possible for conventional plasmonic nanopatterns with quenching effects. Through simulations and experiments, the interactions between nanopatterns with adjacent fluorescence and surrounding lipid membranes are studied. It facilitates precise quantitative cell&#8208;biology studies to investigate molecular&#8208;scale signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.








Abstract
Nanoscale organization of transmembrane receptors is critical for cellular functions, enabled by the nanoscale engineering of bioligand presentation. Previously, a spatial threshold of &#8804;60&#160;nm for integrin binding ligands in cell&#8211;matrix adhesion is demonstrated using monoliganded gold nanoparticles. However, the ligand geometric arrangement is limited to hexagonal arrays of monoligands, while plasmonic quenching limits further investigation by fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution imaging. Here, these limitations are overcome with dielectric TiO2 nanopatterns, eliminating fluorescence quenching, thus enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanopatterns. By dual&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging, high precision and consistency among nanopatterns, bioligands, and integrin nanoclusters are observed, validating the high quality and integrity of both nanopattern functionalization and passivation. By screening TiO2 nanodiscs with various diameters, an increase in fibroblast cell adhesion, spreading area, and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization on 100 nm diameter compared with smaller diameters was observed. Focal adhesion kinase is identified as the regulatory signal. These findings explore the optimal ligand presentation when the minimal requirements are sufficiently fulfilled in the heterogenous extracellular matrix network of isolated binding regions with abundant ligands. Integration of high&#8208;fidelity nano&#8208;biopatterning with super&#8208;resolution imaging allows precise quantitative studies to address early signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale organization of transmembrane receptors is critical for cellular functions, enabled by the nanoscale engineering of bioligand presentation. Previously, a spatial threshold of &#8804;60&#160;nm for integrin binding ligands in cell&#8211;matrix adhesion is demonstrated using monoliganded gold nanoparticles. However, the ligand geometric arrangement is limited to hexagonal arrays of monoligands, while plasmonic quenching limits further investigation by fluorescence-based high-resolution imaging. Here, these limitations are overcome with dielectric TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanopatterns, eliminating fluorescence quenching, thus enabling super-resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanopatterns. By dual-color super-resolution imaging, high precision and consistency among nanopatterns, bioligands, and integrin nanoclusters are observed, validating the high quality and integrity of both nanopattern functionalization and passivation. By screening TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanodiscs with various diameters, an increase in fibroblast cell adhesion, spreading area, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization on 100 nm diameter compared with smaller diameters was observed. Focal adhesion kinase is identified as the regulatory signal. These findings explore the optimal ligand presentation when the minimal requirements are sufficiently fulfilled in the heterogenous extracellular matrix network of isolated binding regions with abundant ligands. Integration of high-fidelity nano-biopatterning with super-resolution imaging allows precise quantitative studies to address early signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>STING Membrane Prevents Post&#8208;Surgery Tissue Adhesion and Tumor Recurrence of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel stimulator of interferon genes &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane is developed to overcome colorectal cancer recurrence and post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion. The gambogic acid prodrug and STING agonist are continuously released from the core and shell layers, respectively, efficiently inducing immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and evoking the systemic anticancer immunity by activating the Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) synthase/STING pathway.








Abstract
Surgery is the standard treatment regimen for resectable colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is very hard to completely remove all cancer cells in clinical practice, leading to the high recurrence rates of the disease. Moreover, the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion greatly prevents the possibility of reoperation, significantly limiting the long&#8208;term surviving of CRC patients. To overcome CRC recurrence and avoid the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion, this work develops a novel stimulator of interferon genes &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane based on the coaxial electrospinning technology and hyaluronic acid modification. A reactive oxygen species responsive prodrug of gambogic acid (GB) and a potent STING agonist (CDN) are coloaded in the core&#8211;shell structure of the membrane, which endows the loaded drug with sustained and sequential release patterns. The localized delivery of GB and CDN can selectively induce efficient immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and then evoke the systemic anticancer immunity by activating the Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) synthase/STING pathway. As&#8208;designed &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane not only safely prevents tumor recurrence through the synergistic chemoimmunotherapy but also efficiently avoids the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion, facilitating the clinical intervention of CRC.

         <title>Capillarity Enabled Large&#8208;Array Liquid Metal Electrodes for Compact and High&#8208;Throughput Dielectrophoretic Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile method is proposed to integrate high&#8208;density thick liquid metal alloy (LMA) electrodes in microfluidic devices, leveraging the passive control ability of capillary burst valves with carefully designed burst pressures. This allows self&#8208;assembly of LMA electrode array through simple hand&#8208;push injection. The fabricated 5000 pairs of LMA electrodes are demonstrated to achieve ten times higher throughput in dielectrophoresis deflection.








Abstract
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) particle separation has label&#8208;free, well&#8208;controllable, and low&#8208;damage merits. Sidewall microelectrodes made of liquid metal alloy (LMA) inherits the additional advantage of thick electrodes to generate impactful DEP force. However, existing LMA electrode&#8208;based devices lack the ability to integrate large&#8208;array electrodes in a compact footprint, severely limiting flow rate and thus throughput. Herein, a facile and versatile method is proposed to integrate high&#8208;density thick LMA electrodes in microfluidic devices, taking advantage of the passive control ability of capillary burst valves (CBVs). CBVs with carefully designed burst pressures are co&#8208;designed in microfluidic channels, allowing self&#8208;assembly of LMA electrode array through simple hand&#8208;push injection. The arrayed electrode configuration brings the accumulative DEP deflection effect. Specifically, The fabricated 5000 pairs of sidewall electrodes in a compact chip are demonstrted to achieve ten times higher throughput in DEP deflection. The 5000&#8208;electrode&#8208;pair device is applied to successfully separate four mixed samples, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and A549 cells&#160;with the flow rate of 70 &#181;L min&#8722;1. It is envisioned that this work can greatly facilitate LMA electrode array fabrication and offer a robust and versatile platform for DEP separation applications.

         <title>Orally Ingested Self&#8208;Powered Stimulators for Targeted Gut&#8211;Brain Axis Electrostimulation to Treat Obesity and Metabolic Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After oral administration in mice, the piezoelectric BTO@Cap particles target and bind to the capsaicin&#8208;sensitive mucosal nerve endings on the gastric surface. In response to gastric movement, these particles spontaneously generate mild electric pulses, stimulating the vagal afferent fibers. These fibers then transmit the stimulated signals to the brain, regulating food intake and energy expenditure, ultimately facilitating obesity management.








Abstract
Obesity is a significant health concern that often leads to metabolic dysfunction and chronic diseases. This study introduces a novel approach to combat obesity using orally ingested self&#8208;powered electrostimulators. These electrostimulators consist of piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) particles conjugated with capsaicin (Cap) and aim to activate the vagus nerve. Upon ingestion by diet&#8208;induced obese (DIO) mice, the BTO@Cap particles specifically target and bind to Cap&#8208;sensitive sensory nerve endings in the gastric mucosa. In response to stomach peristalsis, these particles generate electrical signals. The signals travel via the gut&#8211;brain axis, ultimately influencing the hypothalamus. By enhancing satiety signals in the brain, this neuromodulatory intervention reduces food intake, promotes energy metabolism, and demonstrates minimal toxicity. Over a 3&#8208;week period of daily treatments, DIO mice treated with BTO@Cap particles show a significant reduction in body weight compared to control mice, while maintaining their general locomotor activity. Furthermore, this BTO@Cap particle&#8208;based treatment mitigates various metabolic alterations associated with obesity. Importantly, this noninvasive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;administer intervention holds potential for addressing other intracerebral neurological diseases.

         <title>Colloidal Synthesis of P&#8208;Type Zn3As2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals with high crystallinity and accurate stoichiometry are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based approach by adjusting the precursor concentration. The synthesized colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals are successfully employed for the first time in p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors, resulting in enhanced p&#8208;type characteristics and increased hole mobility via phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange.








Abstract
Zinc pnictides, particularly Zn3As2, hold significant promise for optoelectronic applications owing to their intrinsic p&#8208;type behavior and appropriate bandgaps. However, despite the outstanding properties of colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals, research in this area is lacking because of the absence of suitable precursors, occurrence of surface oxidation, and intricacy of the crystal structures. In this study, a novel and facile solution&#8208;based synthetic approach is presented for obtaining highly crystalline p&#8208;type Zn3As2 nanocrystals with accurate stoichiometry. By carefully controlling the feed ratio and reaction temperature, colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals are successfully obtained. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the conversion of As precursors in the initial phases of Zn3As2 synthesis is elucidated. Furthermore, these nanocrystals are employed as active layers in field&#8208;effect transistors that exhibit inherent p&#8208;type characteristics with native surface ligands. To enhance the charge transport properties, a dual passivation strategy is introduced via phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange, leading to enhanced hole mobilities as high as 0.089 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes to the advancement of nanocrystal synthesis, but also opens up new possibilities for previously underexplored p&#8208;type nanocrystal research.

An effective additive (BAH2) is in situ synthesized in perovskite precursor solution by a two&#8208;step addition reaction of but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;amine hydrochloride (BAH) toward formamidinium iodide (FAI) to regulate nucleation and growth of perovskite film along preferred orientation and release lattice strain by forming a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite. Consequently, the BAH&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 25.19% and improved stability.








Abstract
Developing an additive to effectively regulate the perovskite crystallization kinetics for the optimized optoelectronic properties of perovskite film plays a vital role in obtaining high efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new additive is designed and directly synthesized in perovskite precursor solution by utilizing an addition reaction between but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;amine hydrochloride (BAH) and formamidinium iodide. It is found that its product may control the intermediate precursor phase for regulating perovskite nucleation, leading to advantageous 2D perovskite to induce growth of perovskite along the preferred [001] orientation with not only released lattice strain but also strong interaction with perovskite to passivate its surface defects. By taking advantage of the above synergistic effects, the optimized PSC delivers an efficiency of 25.19% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.22 V. Additionally, the devices demonstrate good stability, remaining over 90% of their initial efficiencies under ambient atmosphere conditions for 60 days, high temperature of 85&#160;&#176;C for 200 h, or maximum power point tracking for 500 h.

         <title>A Catalyst&#8208;Like System Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>

A cyclic reaction pathway in perovskite conversion facilitated by catalytic PbI2&#8208;mesylate anion complexes is explored. This approach yields a remarkably homogeneous perovskite film, resulting in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.51% and excellent maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point&#8208;tracking stability in the corresponding perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality perovskite films are essential for achieving high performance of optoelectronic devices; However, solution&#8208;processed perovskite films are known to suffer from compositional and structural inhomogeneity due to lack of systematic control over the kinetics during the formation. Here, the microscopic homogeneity of perovskite films is successfully enhanced by modulating the conversion reaction kinetics using a catalyst&#8208;like system generated by a foaming agent. The chemical and structural evolution during this catalytic conversion is revealed by a multimodal synchrotron toolkit with spatial resolutions spanning many length scales. Combining these insights with computational investigations, a cyclic conversion pathway model is developed that yields exceptional perovskite homogeneity due to enhanced conversion, having a power conversion efficiency of 24.51% for photovoltaic devices. This work establishes a systematic link between processing of precursor and homogeneity of the perovskite films.

         <title>A Cu3BHT&#8208;Graphene van der Waals Heterostructure with Strong Interlayer Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoinduced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer Cu3BHT with large&#8208;scale uniformity and atomic flatness is synthesized using on&#8208;water surface chemistry, which enables the assembly of novel two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructure with strong interlayer coupling upon combining with graphene. Employing time&#8208;resolved THz spectroscopy, highly efficient photoinduced net electron transfer from Cu3BHT to graphene with record high efficiency of up to 34% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWhs) are of significant interest due to their intriguing physical properties critically defined by the constituent monolayers and their interlayer coupling. Synthetic access to 2D vdWhs based on chemically tunable monolayer organic 2D materials remains challenging. Herein, the fabrication of a novel organic&#8211;inorganic bilayer vdWh by combining &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D coordination polymer (2DCP, i.e., Cu3BHT, BHT = benzenehexathiol) with graphene is reported. Monolayer Cu3BHT with detectable &#181;m2&#8208;scale uniformity and atomic flatness is synthesized using on&#8208;water surface chemistry. A combination of diffraction and imaging techniques enables the determination of the crystal structure of monolayer Cu3BHT with atomic precision. Leveraging the strong interlayer coupling, Cu3BHT&#8208;graphene vdWh exhibits highly efficient photoinduced interlayer charge separation with a net electron transfer efficiency of up to 34% from Cu3BHT to graphene, superior to those of reported bilayer 2D vdWhs and molecular&#8208;graphene vdWhs. This study unveils the potential for developing novel 2DCP&#8208;based vdWhs with intriguing physical properties.

         <title>Materiobiomodulated ROS Therapy for De Novo Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a materiobiomodulation therapy using polydopamine nanoparticles for controlled ROS delivery in hair regrowth, utilizing Hyperion mice with an H2O2 biosensor for in vivo ROS monitoring and activation of &#946;&#8208;catenin dependent Wnt signaling in hair follicle stem cells, enabled by a microneedle patch for hair loss treatment.








Abstract
Hair loss is characterized by the inability of hair follicles (HFs) to enter the telogen&#8208;anagen transition (TAT) and lack of de novo HFs. Current pharmaceutical therapies and surgical modalities have been largely limited to regulating hair regrowth efficiently without side effects and lacking treatment compliance. Here, this work proposes a materiobiomodulation therapy (MBMT), wherein polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles with redox activity can be modulated to have a stoichiometric ROS (H2O2) donating ability. These nanoparticles can intracellularly deliver ROS with high&#8208;efficiency via the clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis process. Utilizing homozygote transgenic HyPerion (a genetically&#8208;encoded H2O2 biosensor) mice, this work also achieves in vivo dynamic monitoring of intracellular H2O2 elevation induced by ROS donators. Subcutaneous administration with ROS donators results in rapid onset of TAT and subsequent hair regrowth with a specific ROS &#8220;hormesis effect.&#8221; Mechanistically, ROS activate &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;dependent Wnt signaling, upregulating hair follicle stem cell expression. This work further develops a microneedles patch for transdermal ROS delivery, demonstrating long&#8208;term, low&#8208;dose ROS release. Unlike photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), MBMT requires no external stimuli, providing a convenient and efficient approach for clinical hair loss treatment. This material&#8208;HF communication implicates new avenues in HF&#8208;related diseases, achieving targeted ROS delivery with minimal side effects.

The protein&#8208;protein interaction between Kelch&#8208;like ECH associating protein 1&#160;(Keap1) and nuclear factor erthroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the antioxidant response. Protein&#8208;like polymers (PLPs) were developed to inhibit the Keap1/Nrf2 PPI as multivalent, stable, and bioactive compounds. The polymers overcome prior limitations and&#160;serve as both a chemical biology tool and foundation for Keap1/Nrf2 targeted therapeutics.








Abstract
Successful and selective inhibition of the cytosolic protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) between nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associating protein 1 (Keap1) can enhance the antioxidant response, with the potential for a therapeutic effect in a range of settings including in neurodegenerative disease (ND). Small molecule inhibitors have been developed, yet many have off&#8208;target effects, or are otherwise limited by poor cellular permeability. Peptide&#8208;based strategies have also been attempted to enhance specificity, yet face challenges due to susceptibility to degradation and lack of cellular penetration. Herein, these barriers are overcome utilizing a polymer&#8208;based proteomimetics. The protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) consists of a synthetic, lipophilic polymer backbone displaying water soluble Keap1&#8208;binding peptides on each monomer unit forming a brush polymer architecture. The PLPs are capable of engaging Keap1 and displacing the cellular protective transcription factor Nrf2, which then translocates to the nucleus, activating the antioxidant response element (ARE). PLPs exhibit increased Keap1 binding affinity by several orders of magnitude compared to free peptides, maintain serum stability, are cell&#8208;penetrant, and selectively activate the ARE pathway in cells, including in primary cortical neuronal cultures. Keap1/Nrf2&#8208;inhibitory PLPs have the potential to impact the treatment of disease states associated with dysregulation of oxidative stress, such as NDs.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired Multi&#8208;Modal Mechanoreceptors for Dynamic Haptic Exploration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired multi&#8208;modal mechanoreceptor (SENS) is developed. The rational design of SENS allows for high&#8208;precision multidimensional (i.e., spatial direction) and multimodal (i.e., hardness, roughness, and adhesion) sensing, enabling the development of a closed&#8208;loop robotic system with the capability to accurately recognize objects. Such a strategy is universal and adaptable to a broad range of fields for flexible sensors and robotics.








Abstract
Active sensing is a fundamental aspect of human and animal interactions with the environment, providing essential information about the hardness, texture, and tackiness of objects. This ability stems from the presence of diverse mechanoreceptors in the skin, capable of detecting a wide range of stimuli and from the sensorimotor control of biological mechanisms. In contrast, existing tactile sensors for robotic applications typically excel in identifying only limited types of information, lacking the versatility of biological mechanoreceptors and the requisite sensing strategies to extract tactile information proactively. Here, inspired by human haptic perception, a skin&#8208;inspired artificial 3D mechanoreceptor (SENS) capable of detecting multiple mechanical stimuli is developed to bridge sensing and action in a closed&#8208;loop sensorimotor system for dynamic haptic exploration. A tensor&#8208;based non&#8208;linear theoretical model is established to characterize the 3D deformation (e.g., tensile, compressive, and shear deformation) of SENS, providing guidance for the design and optimization of multimode sensing properties with high fidelity. Based on SENS, a closed&#8208;loop robotic system capable of recognizing objects with improved accuracy (&#8776;96%) is further demonstrated. This dynamic haptic exploration approach shows promise for a wide range of applications such as autonomous learning, healthcare, and space and deep&#8208;sea exploration.

         <title>Transient Nanoscopy of Exciton Dynamics in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;field transient nanoscopy is developed to probe exciton dynamics in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides beyond the diffraction limit. The investigation of local exciton recombination and exciton&#8211;exciton annihilation processes with nanoscale resolution is demonstrated.








Abstract
The electronic and optical properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides are dominated by strong excitonic resonances. Exciton dynamics plays a critical role in the functionality and performance of many miniaturized 2D optoelectronic devices; however, the measurement of nanoscale excitonic behaviors remains challenging. Here, a near&#8208;field transient nanoscopy is reported to probe exciton dynamics beyond the diffraction limit. Exciton recombination and exciton&#8211;exciton annihilation processes in monolayer and bilayer MoS2 are studied as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration. Moreover, with the capability to access local sites, intriguing exciton dynamics near the monolayer&#8208;bilayer interface and at the MoS2 nano&#8208;wrinkles are resolved. Such nanoscale resolution highlights the potential of this transient nanoscopy for fundamental investigation of exciton physics and further optimization of functional devices.

         <title>Activating CD8+ T Cells by Pt(IV) Prodrug&#8208;Based Nanomedicine and aPD&#8208;L1 Antibody for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment is a crucial factor that affects the effectiveness of cancer therapy. In this study, the combined action of retinoic acid&#8208;containing polymers and Pt(IV) prodrugs induces a potent antitumor effect by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells infiltration and promoting T&#8208;cell immune responses, which ultimately effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in cancer immunotherapy, specifically T cell&#8208;based therapies. However, the application of T cell therapies has been primarily limited to hematologic malignancies, with limited success in the treatment of solid tumors. The main challenge in treating solid tumor is immune escape, which is characterized by reduced antigenicity, diminished immunogenicity, and the development of suppressive tumor immune microenvironments. To address these obstacles and restore T cell&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor responses, a novel nanoparticle formulation known as PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 is developed. This innovative approach combines retinoic acid and Pt(IV) to specifically target and overcome immune escape. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 primarily relies on its ability to induce anti&#8208;tumor T cell responses, in contrast to the cytotoxicity associated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. When combined with an immune checkpoint blockade, anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody, PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 effectively eliminates solid tumors and induces immune memory responses, which prevent tumor metastasis and recurrence. This promising approach holds great potential for enhancing the treatment of solid tumors with T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Laser&#8208;Induced Switching of an Exchange Biased Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnets are an exciting class of materials due to their inherently THz dynamics and complex interactions. Here, the highlight of the work is the demonstration that it is possible to switch the coupled antiferromagnet with a single femtosecond laser pulse. The results provide a means of direct and deterministic control of an antiferromagnet on the sub&#8208;picosecond timescale.








Abstract
Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic order has challenged the understanding of the fundamental and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. So far single&#8208;shot magnetic switching has been limited to ferrimagnetic alloys, multilayers, and designed ferromagnetic (FM) heterostructures. In FM/antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers, exchange bias (He) arises from the interfacial exchange coupling between the two layers and reflects the microscopic orientation of the antiferromagnet. Here the possibility of single&#8208;shot switching of the antiferromagnet (change of the sign and amplitude of He) with a single femtosecond laser pulse in IrMn/CoGd bilayers is demonstrated. The manipulation is demonstrated in a wide range of fluences for different layer thicknesses and compositions. Atomistic simulations predict ultrafast switching and recovery of the AFM magnetization on a timescale of 2 ps. The results provide the fastest and the most energy&#8208;efficient method to set the exchange bias and pave the way to potential applications for ultrafast spintronic devices.

         <title>Transformable Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembled Peptides for Cascade Self&#8208;Enhanced Ferroptosis Primed Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a a smart supramolecular self&#8208;assembled peptide TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY for prostate cancer (PCa) immunotherapy. At tumor cells, TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY initiates tumor cell cascade self&#8208;enhanced immunogenic ferroptosis via enzyme&#8208;triggered morphological transformation. The powerful immunomodulatory effect not only stimulates a solid antitumor immune response to suppress the primary tumor, but also creates a long&#8208;term immune memory to prevent tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received widespread attention for its effective and long&#8208;term tumor&#8208;eliminating ability. However, for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors, such as prostate cancer (PCa), the low immunogenicity of the tumor itself is a serious obstacle to efficacy. Here, this work reports a strategy to enhance PCa immunogenicity by triggering cascade self&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis in tumor cells, turning the tumor from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221;. This work develops a transformable self&#8208;assembled peptide TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) responsiveness and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein targeting. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions and transforms into nanofibers in response to ALP during endosome/lysosome uptake into tumor cells, promoting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). On the one hand, the released TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRAY nanofibers target GPX4 and selectively degrade the GPX4 protein under the light irradiation, inducing ferroptosis; on the other hand, the large amount of leaked Fe2+ further cascade to amplify the ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY&#8208;induced immunogenic ferroptosis improves tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and increasing intratumor T&#8208;cell infiltration. More importantly, recovered T cells further enhance ferroptosis by secreting large amounts of interferon&#8208;gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;). This work provides a novel strategy for the molecular design of synergistic molecularly targeted therapy for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite/C60 Interface Modification via Atomic Layer Deposited Aluminum Oxide for Perovskite Solar Cells and Perovskite&#8211;Silicon Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells could be the future of PV, but stability and easy fabrication are the keys. Here, an atomic layer deposited aluminum oxide that universally results in a 1% absolute efficiency boost is shown, resulting in 30% power conversion efficiency for a tandem and enhanced device lifetime, paving the way for more reliable solar energy solutions.








Abstract
The primary performance limitation in inverted perovskite&#8208;based solar cells is the interface between the fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers and the perovskite. Atomic layer deposited thin aluminum oxide (AlOX) interlayers that reduce nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed, resulting in &gt;60 millivolts improvement in open&#8208;circuit voltage and 1% absolute improvement in power conversion efficiency. Surface&#8208;sensitive characterizations indicate the presence of a thin, conformally deposited AlOx layer, functioning as a passivating contact. These interlayers work universally using different lead&#8208;halide&#8211;based absorbers with different compositions where the 1.55 electron volts bandgap single junction devices reach &gt;23% power conversion efficiency. A reduction of metallic Pb0 is found and the compact layer prevents in&#8208; and egress of volatile species, synergistically improving the stability. AlOX&#8208;modified wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers as a top cell in a monolithic perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem enable a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.9% and open&#8208;circuit voltages above 1.92 volts for 1.17 square centimeters device area.

         <title>Mechanically Robust Self&#8208;Organized Crack&#8208;Free Nanocellular Graphene with Outstanding Electrochemical Properties in Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crack&#8208;free nanocellular graphene is developed by liquid metal dealloying. The defect&#8208;free nature of the precursor leads to the self&#8208;organization of nanocellular carbons without cracks, and offers an exceptional combination of high tensile strength, good electrical conductivity, and high specific surface area. Multifunctionality of this unique graphene material enhances the rate and cycle performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Crack&#8208;free nanocellular graphenes are attractive materials with extraordinary mechanical and electrochemical properties, but their homogeneous synthesis on the centimeter scale is challenging. Here, a strong nanocellular graphene film achieved by the self&#8208;organization of carbon atoms using liquid metal dealloying and employing a defect&#8208;free amorphous precursor is reported. This study demonstrates that a Bi melt strongly catalyzes the self&#8208;structuring of graphene layers at low processing temperatures. The robust nanoarchitectured graphene displays a high&#8208;genus seamless framework and exhibits remarkable tensile strength (34.8&#160;MPa) and high electrical conductivity (1.6 &#215; 104 S m&#8722;1). This unique material has excellent potential for flexible and high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Neutrophil Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Polyprodrug Nanomedicine for Inflammation Suppression in Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutrophil membrane&#8208;coated reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polyprodrug nanoparticle (NRN) is reported for the ischemic brain&#8208;targeted delivery of fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) with minimal side effects. NRNs exhibit enhanced blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, ischemic brain&#8208;targeted accumulation, and effective neuroprotection with minimal side effects owing to neutrophil membrane coating and ROS&#8208;responsive FTY720 release.








Abstract
Neuroinflammation has emerged as a major concern in ischemic stroke therapy because it exacebates neurological dysfunction and suppresses neurological recovery after ischemia/reperfusion. Fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) is an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;inflammatory drug which exhibits potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain parenchyma. However, delivering a sufficient amount of FTY720 through the blood&#8211;brain barrier into brain lesions without inducing severe cardiovascular side effects remains challenging. Here, a neutrophil membrane&#8208;camouflaged polyprodrug nanomedicine that can migrate into ischemic brain tissues and in situ release FTY720 in response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. This nanomedicine delivers 15.2&#8208;fold more FTY720 into the ischemic brain and significantly reduces the risk of cardiotoxicity and infection compared with intravenously administered free drug. In addition, single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis identifies that the nanomedicine attenuates poststroke inflammation by reprogramming microglia toward anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotypes, which is realized via modulating Cebpb&#8208;regulated activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and secretion of CXCL2 chemokine. This study offers new insights into the design and fabrication of polyprodrug nanomedicines for effective suppression of inflammation in ischemic stroke therapy.

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation via Pyridine&#8208;Derivative Isomers Enables Efficient 1.68 eV Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of a series of pyridine&#8208;derivative isomers containing both amino and carboxyl on the quality and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite are studied. The isomer with uniform functional group distribution delivers the best performance. A certified cell efficiency of 22.17% is obtained using the 1.68 eV perovskite, which is one of the highest values in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced phase segregation is one of the main issues restricting the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). Small organic molecules with abundant functional groups can passivate various defects, and therefore suppress the ionic migration channels for phase segregation. Herein, a series of pyridine&#8208;derivative isomers containing amino and carboxyl are applied to modify the perovskite surface. The amino, carboxyl, and N&#8208;terminal of pyridine in all of these molecules can interact with undercoordinated Pb2+ through coordination bonds and suppress halide ions migration via hydrogen bonding. Among them, the 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;pyridine carboxyl acid (APA&#8208;3) treated devices win the champion performance, enabling an efficiency of 22.35% (certified 22.17%) using the 1.68 eV perovskite, which represents one of the highest values for WBG&#8208;PSCs. This is believed to be due to the more symmetric spatial distribution of the three functional groups of APA&#8208;3, which provides a better passivation effect independent of the molecular arrangement orientation. Therefore, the APA&#8208;3 passivated perovskite shows the slightest halide segregation, the lowest defect density, and the least nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the APA&#8208;3 passivated device retains 90% of the initial efficiency after 985 h of operation at the maximum power point, representing the robust durability of WBG&#8208;PSCs under working conditions.

         <title>Efficient Thermal Management with Selective Metamaterial Absorber for Boosting Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation under Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by thermal management with designed selective metamaterial absorber. The design enables to achieve an extraordinary CO2 conversion rate of 516.9&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under a relative mild&#8208;intensity light irradiation at 0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is a prospective strategy to simultaneously reduce CO2 emission and generate value&#8208;added fuels. However, the demand of extremely intense light hinders its development in practical applications. Herein, this work reports the novel design of Ni&#8208;based selective metamaterial absorber and employs it as the photothermal catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. The selective absorption property reduces the heat loss caused by radiation while possessing effectively solar absorption, thus substantially increasing local photothermal temperature. Notably, the enhancement of local electric field by plasmon resonance promotes the adsorption and activation of reactants. Moreover, benefiting from the ingenious morphology that Ni nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;are encapsulated by SiO2 matrix through co&#8208;sputtering, the greatly improved dispersion of Ni NPs enables enhancing the contact with reaction gas and preventing the agglomeration. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits an unprecedented CO2 conversion rate of 516.9&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under 0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2 irradiation, with near 90% CO selectivity and high stability. Significantly, this designed photothermal catalyst demonstrates the great potential in practical applications under sunlight. This work provides new sights for designing high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts by thermal management.

         <title>Direct Observation of Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmion Motion Driven by Ultra&#8208;Low Current Density in Van Der Waals Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;induced magnetic skyrmion motion is directly visualized in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) at room temperature. The electrical pulse can thermally generate the skyrmions under an external magnetic field. In addition, magnetic skyrmions are effectively driven by electrical current. The results demonstrate the feasibility of operating skyrmion devices at room temperature using 2D materials.








Abstract
The recent discovery of room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, such as Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), has garnered significant interest in offering a robust platform for 2D spintronic applications. Various fundamental operations essential for the realization of 2D spintronics devices are experimentally confirmed using these materials at room temperature, such as current&#8208;induced magnetization switching or tunneling magnetoresistance. Nevertheless, the potential applications of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT systems at room temperature remain unexplored. In this work, the current&#8208;induced generation of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT flakes employing high&#8208;resolution magnetic transmission soft X&#8208;ray microscopy is introduced, supported by a feasible mechanism based on thermal effects. Furthermore, direct observation of the current&#8208;induced magnetic skyrmion motion at room temperature in FGaT flakes is presented with ultra&#8208;low threshold current density. This work highlights the potential of FGaT as a foundation for room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating 2D skyrmion device applications.

         <title>In Situ Insights into Cathode Calcination for Predictive Synthesis: Kinetic Crystallization of LiNiO2 from Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcination is a commonly used in making battery cathode materials. However, its inherent complexity associated with elusive intermediates hinders the predictive synthesis of high&#8208;performance cathodes. This study unveils the kinetic crystallization process&#160;of forming LiNiO2, the archetypical Ni&#8208;based cathode during calcination from hydroxides, providing insights into controlling structure&#160;and morphology&#160;through lithiation in the calcination process.








Abstract
Calcination is a solid&#8208;state synthesis process widely deployed in battery cathode manufacturing. However, its inherent complexity associated with elusive intermediates hinders the predictive synthesis of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Here, correlative in situ X&#8208;ray absorption/scattering spectroscopy is used to investigate the calcination of nickel&#8208;based cathodes, focusing specifically on the archetypal LiNiO2 from Ni(OH)2. Combining in situ observation with data&#8208;driven analysis reveals concurrent lithiation and dehydration of Ni(OH)2 and consequently, the low&#8208;temperature crystallization of layered LiNiO2 alongside lithiated rocksalts. Following early nucleation, LiNiO2 undergoes sluggish crystallization and structural ordering while depleting rocksalts; ultimately, it turns into a structurally&#8208;ordered layered phase upon full lithiation but remains small in size. Subsequent high&#8208;temperature sintering induces rapid crystal growth, accompanied by undesired delithiation and structural degradation. These observations are further corroborated by mesoscale modeling, emphasizing that, even though calcination is thermally driven and favors transformation towards&#160;thermodynamically equilibrium phases, the actual phase propagation and crystallization can be kinetically tuned via lithiation, providing freedom for structural and morphological control during cathode calcination.

By constructing these waveguide structures, ultrahigh spatial resolutions of 60.8 and 51.7 lp mm&#8722;1 at a modulation transfer function (MTF) of 0.2 are achieved on 0.5&#160;mm and even 1&#160;mm thick scintillators, respectively.








Abstract
The exacerbation of inherent light scattering with increasing scintillator thickness poses a major challenge for balancing the thickness&#8208;dependent spatial resolution and scintillation brightness in X&#8208;ray imaging scintillators. Herein, a thick pixelated needle&#8208;like array scintillator capable of micrometer resolution is fabricated via waveguide structure engineering. Specifically, this involves integrating a straightforward low&#8208;temperature melting process of manganese halide with an aluminum&#8208;clad capillary template. In this waveguide structure, the oriented scintillation photons propagate along the well&#8208;aligned scintillator and are confined within individual pixels by the aluminum reflective cladding, as substantiated from the comprehensive analysis including laser diffraction experiments. Consequently, thanks to isolated light&#8208;crosstalk channels and robust light output due to increased thickness, ultrahigh spatial resolutions of 60.8 and 51.7 lp mm&#8722;1 at a modulation transfer function (MTF) of 0.2 are achieved on 0.5&#160;mm and even 1&#160;mm thick scintillators, respectively, which both exceed the pore diameter of the capillary arrays&#8217; template (&#934; = 10&#160;&#181;m). As far as it is known, these micrometer resolutions are among the highest reported metal halide scintillators and are never demonstrated on such thick scintillators. Here an avenue is presented to the demand for thick scintillators in high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging across diverse scientific and practical fields.

         <title>Surface Crystallization Modulation toward Highly&#8208;Oriented and Phase&#8208;Pure 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface crystallization modulation technique is introduced to fabricate the high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with both vertical crystal orientation and high phase purity by regulating the crystallization dynamics. The solvent atmosphere condition is instituted during film processing, which promotes the formation of an oriented 2D perovskite layer at the vapor&#8211;liquid interface and templates the subsequent film growth.








Abstract
2D perovskites have shown great potential toward stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. However, the crystal orientation and phase impurity issues of 2D perovskite films originating from the anisotropic crystal structure and specific growth mechanism have demoted their optoelectronic performances. Here, the surface crystallization modulation technique is introduced to fabricate the high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with both vertical crystal orientation and high phase purity by regulating the crystallization dynamics. The solvent atmosphere condition is instituted during film processing, which promotes the formation of an oriented 2D perovskite layer in stoichiometric composition at the vapor&#8211;liquid interface and templates the subsequent film growth. The solar cells based on the optimized 2D perovskite films exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 15.04%, the record for 2D perovskites (with the perovskite slab thickness n &#8804; 3 and high phase purity). The solar cells based on the highly&#8208;oriented and phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite films also demonstrate excellent thermal and humidity stabilities.

         <title>Stainless Steel Activation for Efficient Alkaline Oxygen Evolution in Advanced Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By&#160;cycling the stainless steel (SS) electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can be enhanced to a great extent compared to pristine electrodes or using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction. Inspired by this observation, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy is then proposed to regenerate the OER activity of SS for its use in electrolyzers powered by intermittent electricity.








Abstract
Designing robust and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in the field of water electrolysis. In this study, an electrochemical strategy to activate stainless steel (SS) electrodes for efficient OER is introduced. By&#160;cycling the SS electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, its OER activity can be enhanced to a great extent compared to using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction, decreasing the overpotential at current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by 40&#160;mV. Electrochemical characterization, Inductively Coupled Plasma &#8211; Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and operando Raman measurements demonstrate that the Fe leaching at the SS surface can be accelerated through a Fe &#8594; &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 &#8594; Fe3O4 or FeO &#8594; Fe2+ (aq.) conversion process, leading to the sustained exposure of Cr and Ni species. While Cr leaching occurs during its oxidation process, Ni species display higher resistance to leaching and gradually accumulate on the SS surface in the form of OER&#8208;active Fe&#8208;incorporated NiOOH species. Furthermore, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy is also introduced to regenerate the OER&#8208;activity of 316&#8208;type SS for stable OER, both in the three&#8208;electrode configuration (without performance decay after 300&#160;h at 350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and in an alkaline water electrolyzer (&#8776;30&#160;mV cell voltage increase after accelerated stress test&#8208;AST). The AST&#8208;stabilized cell can still reach 1000 and 4000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at cell voltages of 1.69 and 2.1&#160;V, which makes it competitive with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers based on ion&#8208;exchange membrane using Ir&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Regulating d&#8208;Orbital Hybridization of Subgroup&#8208;IVB Single Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a common strategy that optimization of the binding energies for the reaction intermediates by tuning the d&#8208;orbital hybridization with axial groups converts inactive subgroup&#8208;IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) moieties (MN4) into active motifs (MN4O). The optimized catalyst exhibits a favorable adsorption of oxygen reduction reaction intermediates and excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction are crucial for improving the energy conversion efficiency, but they suffer from a limited choice of metal centers and unsatisfactory stabilities. Here, this work reports that optimization of the binding energies for reaction intermediates by tuning the d&#8208;orbital hybridization with axial groups converts inactive subgroup&#8208;IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) moieties (MN4) into active motifs (MN4O), as confirmed with theoretical calculations. The competition between metal&#8208;ligand covalency and metal&#8208;intermediate covalency affects the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal site and the intermediates, converting the metal centers into active sites. Subsequently, dispersed single&#8208;atom M sites coordinated by nitrogen/oxygen groups have been prepared on graphene (s&#8208;M&#8208;N/O&#8208;C) catalysts on a large&#8208;scale with high&#8208;energy milling and pyrolysis. Impressively, the s&#8208;Hf&#8208;N/O&#8208;C catalyst with 5.08&#160;wt% Hf exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920&#160;V and encouraging performance in a zinc&#8208;air battery with an extraordinary cycling life of over 1600&#160;h and a large peak power&#8208;density of 256.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides promising single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts and principles for preparing other catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Electric Field Switching of Magnon Spin Current in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12(GdIG) based heterostructure Pt/GdIG/MgO/PMN&#8208;PT is designed, where the magnon spin current in GdIG arises from spin Seebeck effect. Through strain&#8208;mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the reversible complete electric&#8208;field switching of magnon current polarization is realized at ambient temperature in GdIG, which paves the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric field reading and writing.

Manipulation of directional magnon propagation, known as magnon spin current, is essential for developing magnonic devices featuring nonvolatile functionalities and ultralow power consumption. Magnon spin current can usually be modulated by magnetic field or current&#8208;induced spin torques. However, these approaches may lead to energy dissipation due to Joule heating. Electric&#8208;field switching of magnon spin current without charge current is highly preferred but challenging to realize. By integrating magnonic and piezoelectric materials, the manipulation of the magnon spin current generated by the spin Seebeck effect in the ferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG) film on a piezoelectric substrate is demonstrated. Reversible electric&#8208;field switching of magnon polarization without applied charge current is observed. Through strain&#8208;mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces the magnetic compensation transition between two magnetic states of the GdIG, resulting in its magnetization reversal and the simultaneous switching of magnon spin current. This work establishes a prototype material platform that paves the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric field reading and writing and reveals the underlying physics principles of their functions.

         <title>Linearly Interlinked Fe&#8208;Nx&#8208;Fe Single Atoms Catalyze High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel linearly linked iron single&#8208;atom catalyst is developed. The interconnected iron single&#8208;atom and columnated carbon channels can respectively accelerate electron transfer and sodium ion diffusion, enabling the sulfur cathode to exhibit high&#8208;rate conversion and superior cycling stability.








Abstract
Linearly interlinked single atoms offer unprecedented physiochemical properties, but their synthesis for practical applications still poses significant challenges. Herein, linearly interlinked iron single&#8208;atom catalysts that are loaded onto interconnected carbon channels as cathodic sulfur hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries are presented. The interlinked iron single&#8208;atom exhibits unique metallic iron bonds that facilitate the transfer of electrons to the sulfur cathode, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. Additionally, the columnated and interlinked carbon channels ensure rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics to support high&#8208;rate battery reactions. By combining the iron atomic chains and the topological carbon channels, the resulting sulfur cathodes demonstrate effective high&#8208;rate conversion performance while maintaining excellent stability. Remarkably, even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g&#8722;1, the Na&#8208;S battery retains a capacity of 325 mAh g&#8722;1. This work can open a new avenue in the design of catalysts and carbon ionic channels, paving the way to achieve sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy devices.

         <title>Reversible Surface Engineering of Cellulose Elementary Fibrils: From Ultralong Nanocelluloses to Advanced Cellulosic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible surface engineering of cellulose elementary fibrils not only isolates ultralong cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) from various cellulosic bioresources with a low energy consumption and high&#8208;yield process, but also realizes the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials through the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds among CNFs after saponification.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are supramolecular assemblies of cellulose chains that provide outstanding mechanical support and structural functions for cellulosic organisms. However, traditional chemical pretreatments and mechanical defibrillation of natural cellulose produce irreversible surface functionalization and adverse effects of morphology of the CNFs, respectively, which limit the utilization of CNFs in nanoassembly and surface functionalization. Herein, this work presents a facile and energetically efficient surface engineering strategy to completely exfoliate cellulose elementary fibrils from various bioresources, which provides CNFs with ultrahigh aspect ratios (&#8776;1400) and reversible surface. During the mild process of swelling and esterification, the crystallinity and the morphology of the elementary fibrils are retained, resulting in high yields (98%) with low energy consumption (12.4&#160;kJ g&#8722;1). In particular, on the CNF surface, the surface hydroxyl groups are restored by removal of the carboxyl moieties via saponification, which offers a significant opportunity for reconstitution of stronger hydrogen bonding interfaces. Therefore, the resultant CNFs can be used as sustainable building blocks for construction of multidimensional advanced cellulosic materials, e.g., 1D filaments, 2D films, and 3D aerogels. The proposed surface engineering strategy provides a new platform for fully utilizing the characteristics of the cellulose elementary fibrils in the development of high&#8208;performance cellulosic materials.

         <title>Selective Induction of Molecular Assembly to Tissue&#8208;Level Anisotropy on Peptide&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Cardiac Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cardiac photoconductive biointerface capable of inducing biomolecular assembly ordering and anisotropic cellular organization. In particular, it is demonstrated that 1D nanoassemblies comprised of &#960;&#8208;conjugated peptides with high degree of molecular ordering on nanogrooved polymeric templates can effectively induce cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy and sarcomeric alignment through nanotopographic cues with potential photostimulation ability.








Abstract
The conduction efficiency of ions in excitable tissues and of charged species in organic conjugated materials both benefit from having ordered domains and anisotropic pathways. In this study, a photocurrent&#8208;generating cardiac biointerface is presented, particularly for investigating the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to geometrically comply to biomacromolecular cues differentially assembled on a conductive nanogrooved substrate. Through a polymeric surface&#8208;templated approach, photoconductive substrates with symmetric peptide&#8208;quaterthiophene (4T)&#8208;peptide units assembled as 1D nanostructures on nanoimprinted polyalkylthiophene (P3HT) surface are developed. The 4T&#8208;based peptides studied here can form 1D nanostructures on prepatterned polyalkylthiophene substrates, as directed by hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions between 4T and P3HT, and physical confinement on the nanogrooves. It is observed that smaller 4T&#8208;peptide units that can achieve a higher degree of assembly order within the polymeric templates serve as a more efficient driver of cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy than merely presenting aligned &#8208;RGD bioadhesive epitopes on a nanotopographic surface. These results unravel some insights on how cardiomyocytes perceive submicrometer dimensionality, local molecular order, and characteristics of surface cues in their immediate environment. Overall, the work offers a cardiac patterning platform that presents the possibility of a gene modification&#8208;free cardiac photostimulation approach while controlling the conduction directionality of the biotic and abiotic components.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Multiplexed Metasurface Holography by Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An end&#8208;to&#8208;end inverse design framework is proposed. By representing the entire process of meta&#8208;atom mapping and scattered field diffraction propagation as differentiable, the parameters of metasurface can be directly output after inputting target images. Metasurface hologram containing up to 12 channels is designed and experimentally demonstrated by using simple meta&#8208;atoms with two degrees of freedom.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional multiplexed metasurface holography extends holographic information capacity and promises revolutionary advancements for vivid imaging, information storage, and encryption. However, achieving multifunctional metasurface holography by forward design method is still difficult because it relies heavily on Jones matrix engineering, which places high demands on physical knowledge and processing technology. To break these limitations and simplify the design process, here, an end&#8208;to&#8208;end inverse design framework is proposed. By directly linking the metasurface to the reconstructed images and employing a loss function to guide the update of metasurface, the calculation of hologram can be omitted; thus, greatly simplifying the design process. In addition, the requirements on the completeness of meta&#8208;library can also be significantly reduced, allowing multi&#8208;channel hologram to be achieved using meta&#8208;atoms with only two degrees of freedom, which is very friendly to processing. By exploiting the proposed method, metasurface hologram containing up to 12 channels of multi&#8208;wavelength, multi&#8208;plane, and multi&#8208;polarization is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information multiplexing capacity of the metasurface composed of simple meta&#8208;atoms. This method is conducive to promoting the intelligent design of multifunctional meta&#8208;devices, and it is expected to eventually accelerate the application of meta&#8208;devices in colorful display, imaging, storage and other fields.

         <title>An Antioxidative and Active Shrinkage Hydrogel Integratedly Promotes Re&#8208;Epithelization and Skin Constriction for Enhancing Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antioxidant and active shrinkage hydrogel (AHF@AS Gel) is developed to inhibit inflammation and boost proliferation by modulating both biochemical and mechanical signals. Consequently, the AHF@AS Gel promotes skin re&#8208;epithelialization and contraction to accelerate the closure of large&#8208;scale acute and chronic diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Delayed re&#8208;epithelization and weakened skin contractions are the two primary factors that hinder wound closure in large&#8208;scale acute or chronic wounds. However, effective strategies for targeting these two aspects concurrently are still lacking. Herein, an antioxidative active&#8208;shrinkage hydrogel (AHF@AS Gel) is constructed that can integratedly promote re&#8208;epithelization and skin constriction to accelerate large&#8208;scale acute and diabetic chronic wound closure. The AHF@AS Gel is encapsulated by antioxidative amino&#8208; and hydroxyl&#8208;modified C70 fullerene (AHF) and a thermosensitive active shrinkage hydrogel (AS Gel). Specifically, AHF relieves overactivated inflammation, prevents cellular apoptosis, and promotes fibroblast migration in vitro by reducing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, the AHF@AS Gel achieved &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold and &#8776;1.7&#8208;fold better re&#8208;epithelization in acute wounds and chronic diabetic wounds, respectively, significantly contributing to the promotion of wound closure. Using proteomic profiling and mechanistic studies, it is identified that the AHF@AS Gel efficiently promoted the transition of the inflammatory and proliferative phases to the remodeling phase. Notably, it is demonstrated that AS Gel alone activates the mechanosensitive epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt (EGFR/Akt) pathway and promotes cell proliferation. The antioxidative active shrinkage hydrogel offers a comprehensive strategy for acute wound and diabetic chronic wound closure via biochemistry regulation integrating with mechanical forces stimulation.

         <title>All&#8208;Photolithography Fabrication of Ion&#8208;Gated Flexible Organic Transistor Array for Multimode Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density flexible organic ion&#8208;gated transistor (OIGT) arrays with long&#8208;term stability are achieved by an all&#8208;photolithography strategy. OIGT arrays could switch from volatile to nonvolatile modes, which demonstrates the feasibility of integrating a flexible homogeneous reservoir computing (RC) system on the same substrate for precise recognition of handwritten digits, indicating the potential of RC hardware systems for nonlinear realistic tasks.








Abstract
Organic ion&#8208;gated transistors (OIGTs) demonstrate commendable performance for versatile neuromorphic systems. However, due to the fragility of organic materials to organic solvents, efficient and reliable all&#8208;photolithography methods for scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;density OIGT arrays with multimode neuromorphic functions are still missing, especially when all active layers are patterned in high&#8208;density. Here, a flexible high&#8208;density (9662 devices per cm2) OIGT array with high yield and minimal device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation is fabricated by a modified all&#8208;photolithography method. The unencapsulated flexible array can withstand 1000 times&#8217; bending at a radius of 1&#160;mm, and 3 months&#8217; storage test in air, without obvious performance degradation. More interesting, the OIGTs can be configured between volatile and nonvolatile modes, suitable for constructing reservoir computing systems to achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits with low training costs. This work proposes a promising design of organic and flexible electronics for affordable neuromorphic systems, encompassing both array and algorithm aspects.

         <title>Phenothiazine Derivatives as Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes with Adjustable Dropout Voltage and Cycle Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work connects microstructure and macroscopic properties via molecular aggregation, and for the first time summarizes the relationship among molecular structure, molecular aggregation, and electrochemical properties. With the extension of alkyl chain, the dropout voltage exhibits &#8220;odd&#8208;even effect&#8221;, and the cycle stability presents &#8220;alkyl chain length effect&#8221;, providing valuable guidance for the further development of this field.








Abstract
Compared with conventional inorganic materials, organic electrodes are competitive candidates for secondary battery cathodes due to their resourcefulness, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Much effort is devoted at the level of chemical structure, while ignoring the impact of molecular aggregation on battery behavior. Herein, this work designs a series of organic molecules with two electrochemically active phenothiazine groups linked by different lengths of alkyl chain to regulate molecular symmetry and crystallinity. The results emphasize the equally important role of molecular aggregation and chemical structure for battery performance. Among them, 2PTZ&#8208;C7H14|Li cell exhibits the most impressive cycle and rate performance. At the high rate of 50 C, it can still deliver a capacity of 63.4 mA h g&#8722;1 and 74.5% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, the dropout voltage of 2PTZ&#8208;C9H18|Li cell is only 52 mV, which is among the lowest reported for lithium&#8208;organic batteries to the best of the author's knowledge.

         <title>Seamless Integration of Rapid Separation and Ultrasensitive Detection for Complex Biological Samples Using Multistage Annular Functionalized Carbon Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube arrays device is developed for aptamers surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sandwich bacterial detection, which integrate both separation and detection processes to significantly reduce the overall time required for instantaneous detection. This device can quickly process complex biological samples with large volumes and achieve on&#8208;site, multimarker quantitative detection with high sensitivity.








Abstract
Efficient separation, enrichment, and detection of bacteria in diverse media are pivotal for identifying bacterial diseases and their transmission pathways. However, conventional bacterial detection methods that split the separation and detection steps are plagued by prolonged processing times. Herein, a multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube array device designed for the seamless integration of complex biological sample separation and multimarker detection is introduced.

&lt;p&gt;A multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube arrays device is developed for aptamers surface-enhanced Raman scattering sandwich bacterial detection, which integrate both separation and detection processes to significantly reduce the overall time required for instantaneous detection. This device can quickly process complex biological samples with large volumes and achieve on-site, multimarker quantitative detection with high sensitivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient separation, enrichment, and detection of bacteria in diverse media are pivotal for identifying bacterial diseases and their transmission pathways. However, conventional bacterial detection methods that split the separation and detection steps are plagued by prolonged processing times. Herein, a multistage annular functionalized carbon nanotube array device designed for the seamless integration of complex biological sample separation and multimarker detection is introduced. This device resorts to the supersmooth fluidity of the liquid sample in the carbon nanotubes interstice through rotation assistance, achieving the ability to quickly separate impurities and capture biomarkers (1&#160;mL sample cost time of 2.5 s). Fluid dynamics simulations show that the reduction of near-surface hydrodynamic resistance drives the capture of bacteria and related biomarkers on the functionalized surface of carbon nanotube in sufficient time. When further assembled as an even detection device, it exhibited fast detection (&amp;lt;30&#160;min), robust linear correlation (10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming units [CFU] mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>All&#8208;Automated Fabrication of Freestanding and Scalable Photo&#8208;Thermoelectric Devices with High Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;automated laser fabrication technique is reported for the preparation of flexible and freestanding photo&#8208;thermoelectric (PTE) devices with single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube films. The achieved PTE devices with a narrow p&#8211;n transition area of 2&#8211;3 &#181;m exhibit high&#8208;performance among the highest level for freestanding&#8208;film&#8208;based PTE devices.








Abstract
Flexible photo&#8208;thermoelectric (PTE) devices have great application prospects in the fields of solar energy conversion, ultrabroadband light detection, etc. A suitable manufacturing process to avoid the substrate effects as well as to create a narrow transition area between p&#8211;n modules for high&#8208;performance freestanding flexible PTE devices is highly desired. Herein, an automated laser fabrication (ALF) method is reported to construct the PTE devices with rylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;doped n&#8208;type single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. The&#160;wet&#8208;compressing approach is developed to improve the thermoelectric power factors and figure of merit (ZT) of the SWCNT hybrid films. Then, the films are cut and patterned automatically to make PTE devices with various structures by the proposed ALF method. The freestanding PTE device with a narrow transition area of &#8776;2&#8211;3 &#181;m between the p and n modules exhibits a high&#8208;power density of 0.32 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 under the light of 200 mW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest level for freestanding&#8208;film&#8208;based PTE devices. The results pave the way for the automatic production process of PTE devices for green power generation and ultrabroadband light detection.

         <title>Sulfur Vacancies and 1T Phase&#8208;Rich MoS2 Nanosheets as an Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase for 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets (EMoS2) are used as the artificial solid electrolyte interphase to protect Li anode. The EMoS2 containing plentiful of 1T phase and sulfur vacancies can greatly affect the lithiophilicity and diffusion behavior of Li+. As a result, the EMoS2@Li pouch battery with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode&#160;exhibits a high energy density of 403&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. 








Abstract
Constructing large&#8208;area artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to suppress Li dendrites growth and electrolyte consumption is essential for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, chemically exfoliated ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (EMoS2) as an artificial SEI are scalable transfer&#8208;printed on Li&#8208;anode (EMoS2@Li). The EMoS2 with a large amount of sulfur vacancies and 1T phase&#8208;rich acts as a lithiophilic interfacial ion&#8208;transport skin to reduce the Li nucleation overpotential and regulate Li+ flux. With favorable Young's modulus and homogeneous continuous layered structure, the proposed EMoS2@Li effectively suppresses the growth of Li dendrites and repeat breaking/reforming of the SEI. As a result, the assembled EMoS2@Li||LiFePO4 and EMoS2@Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries demonstrate high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5% and 92% after 1000 cycles and 300 cycles, respectively, at ultrahigh cathode loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Ultrasonic transmission technology confirms the admirable ability of EMoS2@Li to inhibit Li dendrites in practical pouch batteries. Remarkably, the Ah&#8208;class EMoS2@Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch battery exhibits an energy density of 403&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 100 cycles with the low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.8 and electrolyte/capacity ratio of 2.1&#8201;g Ah&#8722;1. The strategy of constructing an artificial SEI by sulfur vacancies&#8208;rich and 1T phase&#8208;rich ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets provides new guidance to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs with long cycling stability.

         <title>Giant Modulation of the Second Harmonic Generation by Magnetoelectricity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Multiferroic CuCrP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed. The polarization dependence of the SHG signals is significantly modified, and the signal magnitude is enhanced by one order of magnitude under a finite magnetic field, which can be explained by the magnetoelectric effect.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique magnetoelectric or magnetooptical properties. The recent discovery of few&#8208;layer van der Waals&#160;multiferroic crystals provides a new research direction for controlling the multiferroic properties in the atomic layer limit. However, research on few&#8208;layer multiferroic crystals is limited and the effect of thickness&#8208;dependent symmetries on those properties is less explored. In this study, the symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by optical second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed by the temperature&#8208;dependent SHG signals, revealing significant changes by applying the magnetic field reflecting the magnetoelectric effect. Moreover, it is found that symmetries and resultant magnetoelectric responses can be modulated by the number of layers. These results offer a new principle of controlling the multiferroicity and indicate that 2D van der Waals multiferroic material is a promising building block for functional nanodevices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional interactive cascade nanochip is developed to form a multi&#8208;interaction proton transport pathway for ionization and reduce the thermal conductivity for thermally&#8208;driven desorption. Multiple liver diseases are high&#8208;throughput and accurately detected via a single pass&#160;and potential metabolic biomarkers are revealed via serum metabolic profiling based on nanochip&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis and the neural network model.

It is challenging to detect and differentiate multiple diseases with high complexity/similarity from the same organ. Metabolic analysis based on nanomatrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NMALDI&#8208;MS) is a promising platform for disease diagnosis, while the enhanced property of its core nanomatrix materials has plenty of room for improvement. Herein, a multidimensional interactive cascade nanochip composed of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNPs)/MXene/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), IMG, is reported for serum metabolic profiling to achieve high&#8208;throughput detection of multiple liver diseases. MXene serves as a multi&#8208;binding site and an electron&#8208;hole source for ionization during NMALDI&#8208;MS analysis. Introduction of AuNPs with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties facilitates surface charge accumulation and rapid energy conversion. FeNPs are integrated into the MXene/Au nanocomposite to sharply reduce the thermal conductivity of the nanochip with negligible heat loss for strong thermally&#8208;driven desorption, and construct a multi&#8208;interaction proton transport pathway with MXene and AuNPs for strong ionization. Analysis of these enhanced serum fingerprint signals detected from the IMG nanochip through a neural network model results in differentiation of multiple liver diseases via a single pass and revelation of potential metabolic biomarkers. The promising method can rapidly and accurately screen various liver diseases, thus allowing timely treatment of liver diseases.

         <title>Monolithic Strong Coupling of Topological Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators on Lithium Niobate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coupling of topological surface acoustic wave resonators with a large Rabi splitting and a high&#8208;quality factor operating at gigahertz frequencies based on a single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate acoustic&#8208;electric integrated system is realized. The coupling resonators are prepared by etching nanoscale grooves on the surface of lithium niobate. Then dense wavelength division multiplexers based on multiresonator coupling are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Coherent phonon transfer via high&#8208;quality factor (Q) mechanical resonator strong coupling has garnered significant interest. Yet, the practical applications of these strongly coupled resonator devices are largely constrained by their vulnerability to fabrication defects. In this study, topological strong coupling of gigahertz frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators with lithium niobate is achieved. The nanoscale grooves are etched onto the lithium niobate surface to establish robust SAW topological interface states (TISs). By constructing phononic crystal (PnC) heterostructures, a strong coupling of two SAW TISs, achieving a maximum Rabi splitting of 22&#160;MHz and frequency quality factor product fQm of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 1013&#160;Hz, is realized. This coupling can be tuned by adjusting geometric parameters and a distinct spectral anticrossing is experimentally observed. Furthermore, a dense wavelength division multiplexing device based on the coupling of multiple TISs is demonstrated. These findings open new avenues for the development of practical topological acoustic devices for on&#8208;chip sensing, filtering, phonon entanglement, and beyond.

         <title>Ultralong Cycling and Safe Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells for Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable Li anode prolongs the cycle performance of Li&#8211;S pouch cells far beyond the level in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8211;S batteries as well as renders unprecedented safe and rate performances, thus moving this dream technology a big step closer to reality.








Abstract
While layered metal oxides remain the dominant cathode materials for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries, conversion&#8208;type cathodes such as sulfur present unique opportunities in developing cheaper, safer, and more energy&#8208;dense next&#8208;generation battery technologies. There has been remarkable progress in advancing the laboratory scale lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) coin cells to a high level of performance. However, the relevant strategies cannot be readily translated to practical cell formats such as pouch cells and even battery pack. Here these key technical challenges are addressed by molecular engineering of the Li metal for hydrophobicization, fluorination and thus favorable anode chemistry. The introduced tris(2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) phosphite (TBP) and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBA+F&#8722;) as well as cellulose membrane by rolling enables the formation of a functional thin layer that eliminates the vulnerability of Li metal towards the already demanding environment required (1.55% relative humidity) for cell production and gives rise to LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to suppress dendrite growth. As a result, Li&#8211;S pouch cells assembled at a pilot production line survive 400 full charge/discharge cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55% and impressive rate performance of 1.5 C. A cell&#8208;level energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 2766&#160;W kg&#8722;1 are also delivered via multilayer Li&#8211;S pouch cell. The Li&#8211;S battery pack can even power an unmanned aerial vehicle of 3&#160;kg for a fairly long flight time. This work represents a big step forward acceleration in Li&#8211;S battery marketization for future energy storage featuring improved safety, sustainability, higher energy density as well as reduced cost.

         <title>Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Penetrating and Lesion&#8208;Targeting Nanoplatforms Inspired by the Pathophysiological Features for Synergistic Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanojacket derived from the fusion of 4T1 cell membrane and platelet membrane is designed for precise ischemic stroke lesion targeting and blood brain barrier crossing. By further coating around drug&#8208;loaded liposomes, the fabricated PP@PCL nanoparticles exert favorable anti&#8208;ischemic stroke potency and neuroprotection ability both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke is a dreadful vascular disorder that poses enormous threats to the public health. Due to its complicated pathophysiological features, current treatment options after ischemic stroke attack remains unsatisfactory. Insufficient drug delivery to ischemic lesions impeded by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) largely limits the therapeutic efficacy of most anti&#8208;stroke agents. Herein, inspired by the rapid BBB penetrability of 4T1 tumor cells upon their brain metastasis and natural roles of platelet in targeting injured vasculatures, a bio&#8208;derived nanojacket is developed by fusing 4T1 tumor cell membrane with platelet membrane, which further clothes on the surface of paeonol and polymetformin&#8208;loaded liposome to obtain biomimetic nanoplatforms (PP@PCL) for ischemic stroke treatment. The designed PP@PCL could remarkably alleviate ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury by efficiently targeting ischemic lesion, preventing neuroinflammation, scavenging excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), reprogramming microglia phenotypes, and promoting angiogenesis due to the synergistic therapeutic mechanisms that anchor the pathophysiological characteristics of ischemic stroke. As a result, PP@PCL exerts desirable therapeutic efficacy in injured PC12 neuronal cells and rat model of ischemic stroke, which significantly attenuates neuronal apoptosis, reduces infarct volume, and recovers neurological functions, bringing new insights into exploiting promising treatment strategies for cerebral ischemic stroke management.

         <title>Efficient Ion Percolating Network for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced alignment strategy is explored to effectively control the orientation of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid&#8208;state composite cathodes. Simulation calculations combined with experiments reveal the merits of vertically aligned LLTO NWs in the composite cathode alleviating the ion concentration gradient and enhancing the active material utilization which is promising for achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) face critical challenges of low cathode loading and poor rate performances, which handicaps their energy/power densities. The widely&#8208;accepted aim of high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance seems insufficient to overcome these challenges. Here, it is revealed that an efficient ion percolating network in the cathode exerts a more critical influence on the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. By constructing vertical alignment of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid&#8208;state cathode through magnetic manipulation, the ionic conductivity of the cathode increases twice compared with the cathode consisted of randomly distributed LLTO NWs. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/Li cells using poly(ethylene oxide) as the electrolyte is able to deliver high capacities of 151&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#160;C) and 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (5&#160;C) at 60&#160;&#176;C, and a room&#8208;temperature capacity of 108&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 can be achieved at a charging rate of 2&#160;C. Furthermore, the cell can reach a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 even with a practical LFP loading of 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;A magnetic-field-induced alignment strategy is explored to effectively control the orientation of Li&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid-state composite cathodes. Simulation calculations combined with experiments reveal the merits of vertically aligned LLTO NWs in the composite cathode alleviating the ion concentration gradient and enhancing the active material utilization which is promising for achieving high-performance ASSLBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) face critical challenges of low cathode loading and poor rate performances, which handicaps their energy/power densities. The widely-accepted aim of high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance seems insufficient to overcome these challenges. Here, it is revealed that an efficient ion percolating network in the cathode exerts a more critical influence on the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. By constructing vertical alignment of Li&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid-state cathode through magnetic manipulation, the ionic conductivity of the cathode increases twice compared with the cathode consisted of randomly distributed LLTO NWs. The all-solid-state LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Li cells using poly(ethylene oxide) as the electrolyte is able to deliver high capacities of 151&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2&#160;C) and 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (5&#160;C) at 60&#160;&#176;C, and a room-temperature capacity of 108&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be achieved at a charging rate of 2&#160;C. Furthermore, the cell can reach a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; even with a practical LFP loading of 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The universality of this strategy is also presented showing the demonstration in LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes.

         <title>Layered High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glasses for Photothermal CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered high&#8208;entropy metallic glasses&#160;(HEMG) are obtained which exhibit unprecedented photothermal CO2 methanation performance due to the metastable state of both chemical and structural disorder. The study provides a new perspective to understand the catalytic mechanism of high&#8208;entropy materials, showing its great potential of HEMG to drive the development of a green, carbon&#8208;negative industry in the future.








Abstract
High entropy alloys and metallic glasses, as two typical metastable nanomaterials, have attracted tremendous interest in energy conversion catalysis due to their high reactivity in nonequilibrium states. Herein, a novel nanomaterial, layered high entropy metallic glass (HEMG), in a higher energy state than low&#8208;entropy alloys and its crystalline counterpart due to both the disordered elemental and structural arrangements, is synthesized. Specifically, the MnNiZrRuCe HEMG exhibits highly enhanced photothermal catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. An unprecedented CO2 methanation rate of 489&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 330&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the highest photothermal CO2 methanation rate in flow reactors. The remarkable activity originates from the abundant free volume and high internal energy state of HEMG, which lead to the extraordinary heterolytic H2 dissociation capacity. The high&#8208;entropy effect also ensures the excellent stability of HEMG for up to 450 h. This work not only provides a new perspective on the catalytic mechanism of HEMG, but also sheds light on the great catalytic potential in future carbon&#8208;negative industry.

         <title>Efficient Dual Mechanisms Boost the Efficiency of Ternary Solar Cells with Two Compatible Polymer Donors to Exceed 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary strategy has attracted tremendous interest due to its versatile advantages for improving the performance of organic solar cells. In this work, two polymer donors based ternary organic solar cells are prepared to achieve both high power conversion efficiency (over 19%) and long thermal stability. This study proposes the collaborative regulation of two critical driving forces mechanisms for constructing high&#8208;performance ternary organic solar cells.








Abstract
Ternary strategyopens a simple avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The introduction of wide bandgap polymer donors (PDs) as third component canbetter utilize sunlight and&#160;improve the mechanical and thermal stability of active layer. However, efficient ternary OSCs (TOSCs) with two PDs are rarely reported due to inferior compatibility and shortage of efficient PDs match with acceptors. Herein, two PDs&#8208;(PBB&#8208;F and PBB&#8208;Cl) are adopted in the dual&#8208;PDs ternary systems to explore the underlying mechanisms and improve their photovoltaic performance. The findings demonstrate that the third components exhibit excellent miscibility with PM6 and are embedded in the host donor to form alloy&#8208;like phase. A more profound mechanism for enhancing efficiency through dual mechanisms, that are the guest energy transfer to PM6 and charge transport at the donor/acceptor interface, has been proposed. Consequently, the PM6:PBB&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 TOSCs achieve PCE of over 19%. Furthermore, the TOSCs exhibit better thermal stability than that of binary OSCs due to the reduction in spatial site resistance resulting from a more tightly entangled long&#8208;chain structure. This work not only provides an effective approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance TOSCs, but also demonstrates the importance of developing dual compatible PD materials.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Fungal Biomarkers in Clinical Samples via an Interface&#8208;Modulated Optical Fiber Biosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;modulated biosensor, utilizing an optical fiber for the quantitative analysis of fungal biomarkers for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), is demonstrated. It overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods, including a high rate of misdiagnosis, prolonged detection time, elevated costs, and the requirement for stringent laboratory conditions, and offers promising prospects for prompt and precise diagnosis in resource&#8208;constrained and underdeveloped regions.








Abstract
Invasive fungal infections pose a significant public health threat. The lack of precise and timely diagnosis is a primary factor contributing to the significant increase in patient mortality rates. Here, an interface&#8208;modulated biosensor utilizing an optical fiber for quantitative analysis of fungal biomarkers at the early stage of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), is reported. By integrating surface refractive index (RI) modulation and plasmon enhancement, the sensor to achieve high sensitivity in a directional response to the target analytes, is successfully optimized. As a result, a compact fiber&#8208;optic sensor with rapid response time, cost&#8208;effectiveness, exceptional sensitivity, stability, and specificity, is developed. This sensor can successfully identify the biomarkers of specific pathogens from blood or other tissue specimens in animal models. It quantifies clinical blood samples with precision and effectively discriminates between negative and positive cases, thereby providing timely alerts to potential patients. It significantly reduces the detection time of fungal infection to only 30 min. Additionally, this approach exhibits remarkable stability and achieves a limit of detection (LOD) three orders of magnitude lower than existing methods. It overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods, including a high rate of misdiagnosis, prolonged detection time, elevated costs, and the requirement for stringent laboratory conditions.

         <title>Decomposable Nanoagonists Enable NIR&#8208;Elicited cGAS&#8208;STING Activation for Tandem&#8208;Amplified Photodynamic&#8208;Metalloimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A decomposable nanoagonist is developed for agonists&#8208;free cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) activation. This process results in released mitochondrial DNA, inhibited nuclear DNA repair, and metal ions&#8208;boosted cGAS enzyme activity, synergistically facilitating the cGAS&#8208;STING activation. Combining these effects and the photodynamic&#8208;enhanced antitumor immune response, the nanoagonist enables an amplified photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy of tumors.








Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has emerged as an efficient strategy to improve the therapeutic outcomes of immunotherapy. However, the &#8220;constantly active&#8221; mode of current STING agonist delivery strategies typically leads to off&#8208;target toxicity and hyperimmunity. To address this critical issue, herein a metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;based nanoagonist (DZ@A7) featuring tumor&#8208;specific and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;enhanced decomposition is constructed for precisely localized STING activation and photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy. The engineered nanoagonist enabled the generation of mitochondria&#8208;targeted reactive oxygen species under NIR irradiation to specifically release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and inhibit the repair of nuclear DNA via hypoxia&#8208;responsive drugs. Oxidized tumor mtDNA serves as an endogenous danger&#8208;associated molecular pattern that activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Concurrently, NIR&#8208;accelerated zinc ions overloading in cancer cells further enhance the cGAS enzymatic activity through metalloimmune effects. By combining the synergistically enhanced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway triggered by NIR irradiation, the engineered nanoagonist facilitated the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for primary tumor eradication, which also established a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immunity to suppress tumor metastasis. Therefore, the developed nanoagonist enabled NIR&#8208;triggered, agonist&#8208;free, and tandem&#8208;amplified activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thereby offering a distinct paradigm for photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy.

However, the &#8220;constantly active&#8221; mode of current STING agonist delivery strategies typically leads to off-target toxicity and hyperimmunity. To address this critical issue, herein a metal-organic frameworks-based nanoagonist (DZ@A7) featuring tumor-specific and near-infrared (NIR) light-enhanced decomposition is constructed for precisely localized STING activation and photodynamic-metalloimmunotherapy. The engineered nanoagonist enabled the generation of mitochondria-targeted reactive oxygen species under NIR irradiation to specifically release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and inhibit the repair of nuclear DNA via hypoxia-responsive drugs. Oxidized tumor mtDNA serves as an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern that activates the cGAS-STING pathway. Concurrently, NIR-accelerated zinc ions overloading in cancer cells further enhance the cGAS enzymatic activity through metalloimmune effects. By combining the synergistically enhanced activation of the cGAS-STING pathway triggered by NIR irradiation, the engineered nanoagonist facilitated the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for primary tumor eradication, which also established a long-term anti-tumor immunity to suppress tumor metastasis. Therefore, the developed nanoagonist enabled NIR-triggered, agonist-free, and tandem-amplified activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby offering a distinct paradigm for photodynamic-metalloimmunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Crown Ether Covalent Organic Framework as Interphase Layer toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D covalent organic framework as protecting layer accelerates Li+ diffusion kinetics, enables stable Li deposition at high current density and capacity, and sheds new light on fabricating interphase layers and inspires the further development of high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of lithium (Li) metal batteries is inhibited by accumulative Li dendrites and continuous active Li consumption during cycling, which results in a low Coulombic efficiency and short lifetime. Constructing artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in Li anode, such as 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), is an effective strategy to restrain the formation of Li dendrites and improve cycling performance. However, the exploration of 3D COFs as protecting layers is rarely reported, because of the preconception that the interconnect pores in 3D COFs eventually cause Li dendrites in disordered direction. 3D crown ether&#8208;based COF with ffc topology as interphase layer, in which the crown ether units are arranged in parallel and vertical orientation along the electrode, is demonstrated. The strong coupling effect between the crown ether and Li+ accelerates Li+ diffusion kinetics and enables homogeneous Li+ flux, resulting in a high Li+ transference number of 0.85 and smooth Li deposition in 3D direction. Li/COF&#8208;Cu cells display a lower Li&#8208;nucleation overpotential (17.4&#160;mV) and high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;98.6% during 340 cycles with COF incorporation. This work gives a new insight into designing COFs for energy storage systems.

         <title>Tough Hydro&#8208;Aerogels with Cation Specificity Enabled Ultra&#8208;High Stability for Multifunctional Sensing and Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;step strategy is exploited to realize the gels with cation specificity. The hydro&#8208;aerogels with the cationic salting&#8208;out effect exhibit promising applications in flexible sensors to effectively monitor human motion, humidity, and marine environment parameters, while the hydro&#8208;aerogels with the cationic salting&#8208;in effect or without borax pretreatment can serve as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes in supercapacitors with excellent stability.








Abstract
The anion&#8208;specific effects of the salting&#8208;in and salting&#8208;out phenomena are extensively observed in hydrogels, whereas the cation specificity of hydrogels is rarely reported. Herein, a multi&#8208;step strategy including borax pre&#8208;gelation, saline soaking, freeze&#8208;drying, and rehydrating is developed to fabricate polyvinyl alcohol gels with cation specificity, exhibiting the specific ordering of effects on the mechanical properties of gels as Ca2+ &gt; Li+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt;&gt; Fe3+ &gt; Cu2+ &gt;&gt; Co2+ &#8776; Ni2+ &#8776; Zn2+. The multiple effects of the fabrication strategy, including the electrostatic repulsion among cations, skeleton support function of graphene oxide nanosheets, and water absorption and retention of ions, endow the gels with the dual characteristics of hydrogels and aerogels (i.e., hydro&#8208;aerogels). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared with the cationic salting&#8208;out effect display attractive pressure sensing performance with excellent stability over 90 days and enable continuous monitoring of ambient humidity in real&#8208;time and effective work in seawater to detect various parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, and temperature). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared without borax pretreatment or using the cationic salting&#8208;in effect can serve as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes in supercapacitors, with 99.59% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles. This study realizes cation specificity in hydrogels and designs multifunctional hydro&#8208;aerogels for promising applications in various fields.

         <title>Green Printing for Scalable Organic Photovoltaic Modules by Controlling the Gradient Marangoni Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of inward Marangoni flow generation and solution thickening caused by the cosolvent strategy can effectively restrain the Coffee&#8208;ring effect during the Hot Blade&#8208;Coating process, resulting in highly homogeneous green&#8208;printed large&#8208;area organic photovoltaics. 








Abstract
Despite the rapid development in the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs), high&#8208;performance OSC modules based on green printing are still limited. The severe Coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE) is considered to be the primary reason for the nonuniform distribution of active layer films. To solve this key printing problem, the cosolvent strategy is presented to deposit the active layer films. The guest solvent Mesitylene with a higher boiling point and a lower surface tension is incorporated into the host solvent o&#8208;XY to optimize the rheological properties, such as surface tension and viscosity of the active layer solutions. And the synergistic effect of inward Marangoni flow generation and solution thickening caused by the cosolvent strategy can effectively restrain CRE, resulting in highly homogeneous large&#8208;area active layer films. In addition, the optimized crystallization and phase separation of active layer films effectively accelerate the charge transport and exciton dissociation of devices. Consequently, based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, the device prepared with the co&#8208;solvent strategy shows the a power conversion efficiency of 17.80%. Moreover, as the effective area scales to 1 and 16.94 cm2, the recorded performances are altered to 16.71% and 14.58%. This study provides a universal pathway for the development of green&#8208;printed high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Black Arsenic Phosphorus Mid&#8208;Wave Infrared Barrier Detector with High Detectivity at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unipolar barrier detector allows for the flow of minority carrier current while effectively inhibiting the flow of majority carriers. The existence of a wide&#8208;bandgap barrier plays a crucial role in preventing Shockley&#8211;Reed&#8211;Hall current within the depletion region of photodiodes. Therefore, the barrier structure allows the passage of photocurrent, while effectively blocking dark current.








Abstract
The barrier structure is designed to enhance the operating temperature of the infrared detector, thereby improving the efficiency of collecting photogenerated carriers and reducing dark current generation, without suppressing the photocurrent. However, the development of barrier detectors using conventional materials is limited due to the strict requirements for lattice and band matching. In this study, a high&#8208;performance unipolar barrier detector is designed utilizing a black arsenic phosphorus/molybdenum disulfide/black phosphorus van der Waals heterojunction. The device exhibits a broad response bandwidth ranging from visible light to mid&#8208;wave infrared (520&#160;nm to 4.6 &#181;m), with a blackbody detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 1010 cmHz&#8722;1/2 W&#8722;1 in the mid&#8208;wave infrared range at room temperature. Moreover, the optical absorption anisotropy of black arsenic phosphorus enables polarization resolution detection, achieving a polarization extinction ratio of 35.5 at 4.6 &#181;m. Mid&#8208;wave infrared imaging of the device is successfully demonstrated at room temperature, highlighting the significant potential of barrier devices based on van der Waals heterojunctions in mid&#8208;wave infrared detection.

         <title>Photochemical Shield Enabling Highly Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;air fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics will become the trend of commercialization of perovskite. However, the oxygen together with light becomes free radicals to accelerate phase transformation of FAPbI3, which further challenge the stability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Therefore, a photochemical shield strategy is developed by employing a light&#8208;oxygen sensitive molecule benzaldehyde.








Abstract
Oxygen is difficult to be physically removed. Oxygen will be excited by light to form free radicals which further attack the lattice of perovskite. The stabilization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 against &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is the key to optimize perovskite solar cells. Herein, the simple molecule, benzaldehyde (BAH) is adopted. The photochemical shield will be established in perovskite layer. Moreover, heterogeneous nucleation induced by BAH enhances the crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the stability of device is improved significantly. The target device maintains 95% of original power conversion efficiency after 1500&#160;h under air conditions and light&#8208;emitting diode light. The power conversion efficiency increases from 23.21% of pristine device to 24.82% of target device.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enriched Single&#8208;Bi&#8208;Atoms Tailoring of Pt Nanorings for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells with Ultralow&#8208;Pt&#8208;Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enriched single&#8208;Bi&#8208;atoms tailored Pt nanorings represent a practical model for activating most of the Pt atoms without blocking Pt sites on the surface. This model ensures the CO&#8208;free pathway, accelerated oxidation of HCOO&#8722; intermediate, and record&#8208;high mass activity toward methanol oxidation electrocatalysis, thus enabling a direct methanol fuel cell with high power density and ultralow Pt loading.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom decorating of Pt emerges as a highly effective strategy to boost catalytic properties, which can trigger the most Pt active sites while blocking the smallest number of Pt atoms. However, the rational design and creation of high&#8208;density single&#8208;atoms on Pt surface remain as a huge challenge. Herein, a customized synthesis of surface&#8208;enriched single&#8208;Bi&#8208;atoms tailored Pt nanorings (SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs) toward methanol oxidation is reported, which is guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggesting that a relatively higher density of Bi species on Pt surface can ensure a CO&#8208;free pathway and accelerate the kinetics of *HCOOH formation. Decorating Pt NRs with dense single&#8208;Bi&#8208;atoms is achieved by starting from PtBi intermetallic nanoplates (NPs) with intrinsically isolated Bi atoms and subsequent etching and annealing treatments. The SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs exhibit a mass activity of 23.77 A mg&#8722;1 Pt toward methanol oxidation in alkaline electrolyte, which is 2.2 and 12.8 times higher than those of Pt&#8208;Bi NRs and Pt/C, respectively. This excellent activity endows the SE&#8208;Bi1/Pt NRs with a high likelihood to be used as a practical anodic electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells &#65288;DMFCs&#65289; with high power density of 85.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and ultralow Pt loading of 0.39 mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Protection Inorganic&#8208;Protein Coating on Mg&#8208;Based Biomaterials through Tooth&#8208;Enamel&#8208;Inspired Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tooth&#8208;enamel&#8208;inspired inorganic&#8208;protein (inorganicPro) coating for Mg&#8208;based biomaterials is developed featuring effective dual&#8208;protection&#8212;anticorrosion and antifouling. The dual&#8208;protection originates from the bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein&#8208;involved biomineralization that alters reaction kinetics to create a dense &#8220;Brick&#8211;Mortar&#8221; structure and establish a BSA layer with low interfacial interactions, ensuring high compactness of coating and exceptional antifouling capabilities.








Abstract
Biocompatible magnesium alloys represent revolutionary implantable materials in dentistry and orthopedics but face challenges due to rapid biocorrosion, necessitating protective coatings to mitigate dysfunction. Directly integrating durable protective coatings onto Mg surfaces is challenging because of intrinsic low coating compactness. Herein, inspired by tooth enamel, a novel highly compact dual&#8208;protection inorganic&#8208;protein (inorganicPro) coating is in situ constructed on Mg surfaces through bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein&#8208;boosted reaction between sodium fluoride (NaF) and Mg substrates. The association of Mg ions and BSA establishes a local hydrophobic domain that lowers the formation enthalpy of NaMgF3 nanoparticles. This process generates finer nanoparticles that function as &#8220;bricks,&#8221; facilitating denser packing, consequently reducing voidage inside coatings by over 50% and reinforcing mechanical durability. Moreover, the incorporation of BSA in and on the coatings plays two synergistic roles: 1) acting as &#8220;mortar&#8221; to seal residual cracks within coatings, thereby promoting coating compactness and tripling anticorrosion performance, and 2) mitigating fouling&#8208;accelerated biocorrosion in complex biosystems via tenfold resistance against biofoulant attachments, including biofluids, proteins, and metabolites. This innovative strategy, leveraging proteins to alter inorganic reactions, benefits the future coating design for Mg&#8208;based and other metallic materials with tailored anticorrosion and antifouling performances.

         <title>Biomimetic Multimodal Receptors for Comprehensive Artificial Human Somatosensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible multimodal receptor can achieve a reversible transformation from 2D to 3D structure by bending or stretching the sensor, drawing inspiration from the morphological switch observed in the hummingbird feathers. Interestingly, a single&#8208;unit receptor is capable of sensing multiple stimuli, including in&#8208;plane deformation (pressure and bending), out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformation (force and airflow), temperature, and humidity.








Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) capable of acquiring environmental and physiological information has attracted interest for healthcare, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction. However, traditional 2D e&#8208;skin only allows for in&#8208;plane force sensing, which limits access to comprehensive stimulus feedback due to the lack of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane signal detection caused by its 3D structure. Here, a dimension&#8208;switchable bioinspired receptor is reported to achieve multimodal perception by exploiting film kirigami. It offers the detection of in&#8208;plane (pressure and bending) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (force and airflow) signals by dynamically inducing the opening and reclosing of sensing unit. The receptor's hygroscopic and thermoelectric properties enable the sensing of humidity and temperature. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric receptor can differentiate mechanical stimuli from temperature by the voltage. The development enables a wide range of sensory capabilities of traditional e&#8208;skin and expands the applications in real life.

Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrids exhibit an unprecedented narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maxima FWHM&#160;&#8776;43&#160;nm) green emission with high PLQY (98%) and high thermal stability (97%@150&#160;&#176;C). The pc&#8208;LEDs using Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrids exhibit a maximum brightness of &#8776;396&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, photoelectric efficiency of 29.2%, and ultra&#8208;high pixel resolution of 2540&#160;PPI.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites are an emerging class of light&#8208;emitting materials for LED&#8208;based displays; however, their B&#8208;site cations are confined to ns2, d5, and d10 metals. Here, the design of divalent rare earth ions at B&#8208;site is presented and a novel Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrid is reported with efficient (PLQY&#160;&#8776;98%) narrow&#8208;band (FWHM&#160;&#8776;43&#160;nm) green emission and high thermal stability (97%@150&#160;&#176;C). Owing to reduced lattice vibrations and shrunken average distance of Eu(II)&#8208;iodide bonds in the face&#8208;sharing 1D&#8208;structure, photoluminescence from Eu(II) 4f&#8208;5d transition appears along with elevated crystal&#8208;field splitting of 5d energy level. The Eu(II)&#8208;based iodide hybrid is further demonstrated for color&#8208;pure green phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs with a maximum brightness of &#8776;396&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and photoelectric efficiency of 29.2%. High&#8208;resolution micrometer&#8208;scale light&#8208;emitting diode (micro&#8208;LED) displays (2540&#160;PPI) via the solution&#8208;processed screen is also presented. This work thus showcases a compelling narrow&#8208;band green emitter for commercial micro&#8208;LED displays.

         <title>Paraffin&#8208;Enabled Superlattice Customization for a Photostimulated Gradient&#8208;Responsive Artificial Reflex Arc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a gradient&#8208;responsive photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc enabled by programmable and tunable photoreceptor based on folded MoS2 with different twist angles is proposed. These patternable paraffin customized twist moir&#233; superlattice structures enable tuning of optoelectronic properties and gradient response with increasing twist angles, leading to a multiaction response capability in the artificial reflex arc.








Abstract
The development of photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arcs &#8212; a neural circuit inspired by light&#8208;driven motion reflexes &#8212; holds significant promises for advancements in robotic perception, navigation, and motion control. However, the fabrication of such systems, especially those that accommodate multiple actions and exhibit gradient responses, remains challenging. Here, a gradient&#8208;responsive photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc is developed by integrating a programmable and tunable photoreceptor based on folded MoS2 at different twist angles. The twisted folded bilayer MoS2 used as photoreceptors can be customized via the transfer technique using patternable paraffin, where the twist angle and fold&#8208;line could be controlled. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity is 3.7 times higher at a twist angle of 29&#176; compared to that at 0&#176;, showing a monotonically decreasing indirect bandgap. Through tunable interlayer carrier transport, photoreceptors fabricated using folded bilayer MoS2 at different twist angles demonstrate gradient response time, enabling the photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc for multiaction responses. They are transformed to digital command flow and studied via machine learning to control the gestures of a robotic hand, showing a prototype of photostimulated gradient&#8208;responsive artificial reflex arcs for the first time. This work provides a unique idea for developing intelligent soft robots and next&#8208;generation human&#8211;computer interfaces.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;zero energy loss with a record&#8208;high efficiency of &#8776;97.4% and a maximum figure of merit of 330 are realized in BaTiO3&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramic capacitors by aliovalent strongly polar double ion design to control inhomogeneous polarization configuration with multiple symmetries and polarization magnitudes, giving a giant recoverable energy storage density of &#8776;11.6 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh efficiency of &#8776;96.1%.








Abstract
Taking into account the need for energy conservation, achieving near&#8208;zero energy loss, namely ultrahigh efficiency (&#951;), in energy storage capacitors with large recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) plays an important role in applications, which is one of the major challenges in dielectric energy storage field. Here, guided by phase&#8208;field simulation, inhomogeneous polarization configuration with multiple symmetries and polarization magnitudes is controlled through aliovalent strongly polar double ion design to establish a strongly disordered state. A record&#8208;high &#951; of &#8776;97.4% is realized in lead&#8208;free relaxors with a large Wrec of &#8776;8.6 J cm&#8722;3, which also give a giant Wrec of &#8776;11.6 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh &#951; of &#8776;96.1% through high&#8208;energy ball milling, showing a breakthrough progress in ceramic capacitors with a maximum figure of merit of 330. This work demonstrates that controlling inhomogeneous polarization configuration is an effective avenue to develop new high&#8208;performance near&#8208;zero energy loss energy storage capacitors.

         <title>Strontium&#8208;Containing Piezoelectric Biofilm Promotes Dentin Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a strontium&#8208;containing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film is fabricated to create the electrical microenvironment in dentin defects. The piezoelectric biofilm provides surface electrical potential to induce DPSC odonto&#8208;differentiation and the release of strontium ions, both effects of which contribute to endogenous dentin tissue regeneration.








Abstract
It remains an obstacle to induce the regeneration of hard dentin tissue in clinical settings. To overcome this, a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) piezoelectric film with 2 wt% SrCl2 addition is designed. The biofilm shows a high flexibility, a harmonious biocompatibility, and a large piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 14 pC N&#8722;1, all contributing to building an electric microenvironment that favor the recruitment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and their differentiation into odontoblasts during normal chewing, speaking, etc. On the other hand, the strontium ions can be gradually released from the film, thus promoting DPSC odonto&#8208;differentiation. In vivo experiments also demonstrate that the film induces the release of dentin minerals and regeneration of dentin tissue. In the large animal dentin defect models, this piezoelectric film induces in situ dentin tissue formation effectively over a period of three months. This study illustrates a therapeutic potential of the piezoelectric film to improve dentin tissue repair in clinical settings.

         <title>Liquid Metal Loaded Molecular Sieve: Specialized Lithium Dendrite Blocking Filler for Polymeric Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>

Liquid metal and molecular sieve modified polyethylene oxide electrolyte is prepared to address the safety issue and poor Li+ conductivity of polymeric all&#8208;solid&#8211;state electrolyte for lithium&#8211;metal batteries. This functionalized polymer electrolyte could regulate the lithium deposition morphology at the interface, while the liquid metal distributed in the electrolyte could block the penetration of lithium dendrites. 








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8211;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are currently one of the best candidates for realizing the yearning high&#8208;energy&#8211;density batteries with high safety. However, even polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most popular polymeric solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with the largest ionic conductivity in the category so far, has significant challenges due to the safety issues of lithium dendrites, and the insufficient ionic conductivity. Herein, molecular sieve (MS) is integrated into the PEO as an inert filler with the liquid metal (LM) as a functional module, forming an &#8220;LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO&#8221; composite as both SSE with enhanced ionic conductivity, and protection layer against lithium dendrites. As demonstrated by theoretical and experimental investigations, LM released from MS can be uniformly and efficiently distributed in PEO, which could avoid agglomeration, enable the effective blocking of lithium dendrites, and regulate the mass transport of Li ions, thus achieving even deposition of lithium during charge/discharge. Moreover, MS could reduce the crystallinity of PEO, improve lithium&#8208;ion conductivity, and reduce operating temperature. Benefiting from the introduction of the functional MS/LM, the LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO electrolyte exhibits fourfold higher lithium ionic conductivity than the pristine PEO at 40&#160;&#176;C, while the as&#8208;assembled all&#8208;solid&#8211;state LMBs have four to five times longer stable cycle life.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid metal and molecular sieve modified polyethylene oxide electrolyte is prepared to address the safety issue and poor Li+ conductivity of polymeric all-solid&#8211;state electrolyte for lithium&#8211;metal batteries. This functionalized polymer electrolyte could regulate the lithium deposition morphology at the interface, while the liquid metal distributed in the electrolyte could block the penetration of lithium dendrites. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid&#8211;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are currently one of the best candidates for realizing the yearning high-energy&#8211;density batteries with high safety. However, even polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most popular polymeric solid-state electrolyte (SSE) with the largest ionic conductivity in the category so far, has significant challenges due to the safety issues of lithium dendrites, and the insufficient ionic conductivity. Herein, molecular sieve (MS) is integrated into the PEO as an inert filler with the liquid metal (LM) as a functional module, forming an &#8220;LM-MS-PEO&#8221; composite as both SSE with enhanced ionic conductivity, and protection layer against lithium dendrites. As demonstrated by theoretical and experimental investigations, LM released from MS can be uniformly and efficiently distributed in PEO, which could avoid agglomeration, enable the effective blocking of lithium dendrites, and regulate the mass transport of Li ions, thus achieving even deposition of lithium during charge/discharge. Moreover, MS could reduce the crystallinity of PEO, improve lithium-ion conductivity, and reduce operating temperature. Benefiting from the introduction of the functional MS/LM, the LM-MS-PEO electrolyte exhibits fourfold higher lithium ionic conductivity than the pristine PEO at 40&#160;&#176;C, while the as-assembled all-solid&#8211;state LMBs have four to five times longer stable cycle life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A PROTAC Augmenter for Photo&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano &#8220;targeting chimera&#8221; (L@NBMZ) comprising a BRD4&#8208;PROTAC and a photosensitizer is engineered as an augmenter for photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis in breast cancer. L@NBMZ can block gene transcription by degrading BRD4 proteins and induce the sequence cleavage of caspase&#8208;3. This kind of caspase&#8208;3 cleavage can be synergistically amplified by light irradiation at the presence of photosensitizer, resulting in efficient photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis.








Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) has recently emerged as a promising strategy for inducing post&#8208;translational knockdown of target proteins in disease treatment. The degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4), an essential nuclear protein for gene transcription, induced by PROTAC is proposed as an epigenetic approach to treat breast cancer. However, the poor membrane permeability and indiscriminate distribution of PROTAC in vivo results in low bioavailability, limiting its development and application. Herein, a nano &#8220;targeting chimera&#8221; (abbreviated as L@NBMZ) consisting of BRD4&#8208;PROTAC combined with a photosensitizer, to serve as the first augmenter for photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis in breast cancer, is developed. With excellent BRD4 degradation ability, high biosafety, and biocompatibility, L@NBMZ blocks gene transcription by degrading BRD4 through proteasomes in vivo, and surprisingly, induces the cleavage of caspase&#8208;3. This type of caspase&#8208;3 cleavage is synergistically amplified by light irradiation in the presence of photosensitizers, leading to efficient photo&#8208;driven pyroptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo outcomes demonstrate the remarkable anti&#8208;cancer efficacy of this augmenter, which significantly inhibits the lung metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. Thus, the photo&#8208;PROTAC &#8220;targeting chimera&#8221; augmenter construction strategy may pave a new way for expanding PROTAC applications within anti&#8208;cancer paradigms.

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Modulation via Polymer Adsorption for Elongated Exciton Diffusion in High&#8208;Efficiency Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of maintaining efficiency in thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs). A novel polymer adsorption strategy that regulates molecular stacking, leading to enhanced intermolecular interactions. A reduction in trap states and an elongation in exciton diffusion length, resulting in a remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency in thick&#8208;film OSCs, is achieved.








Abstract
Developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) with thick active layers is crucial for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing. However, thicker layers often result in lower efficiency. This study tackles this challenge using a polymer adsorption strategy combined with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach. Incorporating insulator polystyrene (PS) into the PM6:L8&#8208;BO system creates PM6+PS:L8&#8208;BO blends, effectively suppressing trap states and extending exciton diffusion length in the mixed donor domain. Adding insulating polymers with benzene rings to the donor enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of donors, boosting intermolecular interactions and electron wave function overlap. This results in more orderly molecular stacking, longer exciton lifetimes, and higher diffusion lengths. The promoted long&#8208;range exciton diffusion leads to high power conversion efficiencies of 19.05% and 18.15% for PM6+PS:L8&#8208;BO blend films with 100 and 300&#160;nm thickness, respectively, as well as a respectable 16.00% for 500&#160;nm. These insights guide material selection for better exciton diffusion, and offer a method for thick&#8208;film OSC fabrication, promoting a prosperous future for practical OSC mass production.

         <title>Strengthening the Metal&#8211;Acid Interactions by Using CeO2 as Regulators of Precisely Placing Pt Species in ZSM&#8208;5 for Furfural Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;confined auto&#8208;redox&#8221; strategy is reported to fix CeO2&#8208;anchored Pt species on the inner wall of a ZSM&#8208;5 cage. The formation of such unique encapsulation structure greatly improves the metal&#8211;acid interactions, thereby achieving a high yield of cyclopentanone&#160;from furfural selective hydrogenation.








Abstract
Understanding the synergism between the metal site and acid site is of great significance in boosting the efficiency of bi&#8208;functional catalysts in many heterogeneous reactions, particularly in biomass upgrading. Herein, a &#8220;confined auto&#8208;redox&#8221; strategy is reported to fix CeO2&#8208;anchored Pt atoms on the inner wall of a ZSM&#8208;5 cage, achieving the target of finely controlling the placements of the two active sites. Compared with the conventional surface&#8208;supported counterpart, the encapsulated Pt/CeO2@ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst possesses remarkably&#8208;improved activity and selectivity, which can convert &gt;99% furfural into cyclopentanone with 97.2% selectivity in 6 h at 160 &#176;C. Besides the excellent catalytic performance, the ordered metal&#8211;acid distribution also makes such kind of catalyst an ideal research subject for metal&#8211;acid interactions. The following mechanization investigation reveals that the enhancement is strongly related to the unique encapsulation structure, which promotes the migration of the reactants over different active sites, thereby contributing to the tandem reaction.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Triggered Tunable Phosphorescence Lifetime of Graphene Quantum Dots in a Solid State</title>

Abstract
Studying the phosphorescent mechanisms of carbon nanostructures synthesized by the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach is key to understanding the structure modulation and the interfacial properties of carbon nanostructures. In this work, the relationships among symmetry of precursors in the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis, structures of products, and phosphorescence lifetimes of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are studied. The symmetry matching of precursors in the formation of a D6h graphene&#8208;like framework is considered the key factor in controlling the separability of sp2 domains in GQDs. As the separability of sp2 domains in GQDs increases, the phosphorescence lifetimes (14.8&#8211;125.5&#160;ms) of GQDs in the solid state can be tuned. Machine learning is used to define the degree of disorder (S) of the GQD structure, which quantitatively describes the different space groups of precursors. The negative correlation between S and the oscillator strength of GQDs is uncovered. Therefore, S can be recognized as reflective of oscillator strength in the GQD structure. Finally, based on the correlations found between the structures and phosphorescence lifetimes of GQDs, GQDs with an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (28.5&#160;s) are obtained. Moreover, GQDs with visible phosphorescence emission (435&#8211;618&#160;nm) are synthesized.

&lt;p&gt;Studying the phosphorescent mechanisms of carbon nanostructures synthesized by the &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approach is key to understanding the structure modulation and the interfacial properties of carbon nanostructures. In this work, the relationships among symmetry of precursors in the &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; synthesis, structures of products, and phosphorescence lifetimes of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are studied. The symmetry matching of precursors in the formation of a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; graphene-like framework is considered the key factor in controlling the separability of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; domains in GQDs. As the separability of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; domains in GQDs increases, the phosphorescence lifetimes (14.8&#8211;125.5&#160;ms) of GQDs in the solid state can be tuned. Machine learning is used to define the degree of disorder (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) of the GQD structure, which quantitatively describes the different space groups of precursors. The negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and the oscillator strength of GQDs is uncovered. Therefore, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; can be recognized as reflective of oscillator strength in the GQD structure. Finally, based on the correlations found between the structures and phosphorescence lifetimes of GQDs, GQDs with an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (28.5&#160;s) are obtained. Moreover, GQDs with visible phosphorescence emission (435&#8211;618&#160;nm) are synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Conductive and Electrogenic Hydrogel Repaired Spinal Cord Injury via Immunoregulation and Enhancement of Neuronal Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked conductive hydrogel has been developed to generate electrical signals and exhibit electrogenic characteristic in the rotating magnetic field. This non&#8208;invasive, well&#8208;distributed, wireless, conductive, and magnetically induced electrogenic system can elicit functional recovery in spinal cord injury mice by anti&#8208;inflammation and facilitating the formation of functional neurons and synapses, providing a novel perspective for the clinical translation.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a refractory neurological disorder. Due to the complex pathological processes, especially the secondary inflammatory cascade and the lack of intrinsic regenerative capacity, it is difficult to recover neurological function after SCI. Meanwhile, simulating the conductive microenvironment of the spinal cord reconstructs electrical neural signal transmission interrupted by SCI and facilitates neural repair. Therefore, a double&#8208;crosslinked conductive hydrogel (BP@Hydrogel) containing black phosphorus nanoplates (BP) is synthesized. When placed in a rotating magnetic field (RMF), the BP@Hydrogel can generate stable electrical signals and exhibit electrogenic characteristic. In vitro, the BP@Hydrogel shows satisfactory biocompatibility and can alleviate the activation of microglia. When placed in the RMF, it enhances the anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, wireless electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into neurons, which is associated with the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In vivo, the BP@Hydrogel is injectable and can elicit behavioral and electrophysiological recovery in complete transected SCI mice by alleviating the inflammation and facilitating endogenous NSCs to form functional neurons and synapses under the RMF. The present research develops a multifunctional conductive and electrogenic hydrogel for SCI repair by targeting multiple mechanisms including immunoregulation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation.

         <title>Tailless Information&#8211;Energy Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tailless information&#8211;energy metasurface platform is proposed by integrating programmable metasurface with wireless power transmission technology. This platform eliminates the need for an external DC power source, which is typically required in conventional programmable metasurface systems. Moreover, it enables the simultaneous transmission of wireless energy and information.








Abstract
Programmable metasurface technology can achieve flexible manipulations of electromagnetic waves in real time by adjusting the surface structure and material properties and has shown extraordinary potential in many fields such as wireless communications and the Internet of Things. However, most of the programmable metasurfaces have a common feature: a tail (electrical wires and DC powers), which is difficult to supply in some particular application scenarios such as canyons and mountains. To eliminate the limitation of DC power supply, the programmable metasurface and wireless power transfer technology are combined to propose a tailless information&#8211;energy metasurface (IEMS). The tailless IEMS platform can dynamically control electromagnetic waves without relying on an external DC power supply; instead, the required DC power is provided internally by the IEMS platform itself. In the tailless IEMS experiments, the concept is demonstrated through the dynamic regulation of wireless channels and the wireless transmission of DC power. This work provides a self&#8208;powered method for programmable metasurfaces, expands the application scenarios, facilitates the miniaturization of systems, and makes it easy to integrate with other systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Long Lifetime Triplet Exciton Reservoir for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel electron transport material 2&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl) dibenzo[b,d]furan&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, possessing a low triplet energy (ET) and extended triplet lifetime, not only effectively enables efficient exciton confinement through the triplet energy transfer but also facilitates prolonged device operational lifetime. This provides an alternative solution for resolving the dilemma that exists in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes between high efficiency and stability in principle.








Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), achieving high efficiency requires effective triplet exciton confinement by carrier&#8208;transporting materials, which typically have higher triplet energy (ET) than the emitter, leading to poor stability. Here, an electron&#8208;transporting material (ETM), whose ET is 0.32 eV lower than that of the emitter is reported. In devices, it surprisingly exhibits strong confinement effect and generates excellent efficiency. Additionally, the device operational lifetime is 4.9 times longer than the device with a standard ETM, 1,3,5&#8208;tri(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl (whose ET 0.36 eV is higher than the emitter). This anomalous finding is ascribed to the exceptionally long triplet state lifetime (&#8776;0.2 s) of the ETM. It is named as long&#8208;lifetime triplet exciton reservoir effect. The systematic analysis reveals that the long triplet lifetime of ETM can compensate the requirement for high ET with the help of endothermic energy transfer. Such combination of low ET and long lifetime provides equivalent exciton confinement effect and high molecular stability simultaneously. It offers a novel molecular design paradigm for breaking the dilemma between high efficiency and prolonged operational lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>Extreme Thermal Insulation and Tradeoff of Thermal Transport Mechanisms between Graphene and WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective thermal conductivity across WS2/graphene bilayer versus interlayer distance is measured experimentally up to distance of 2.69 nm and extended to larger scale through simulation. It is demonstrated that the trade&#8208;off between phonon&#8208; and air&#8208;conduction mechanisms leads to an existence of a minimum conductivity of 1.41 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.11 nm, or two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously.








Abstract
Controlling and understanding the heat flow at a nanometer scale are challenging, but important for fundamental science and applications. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials provide perhaps the ultimate solution for meeting these challenges. While there have been reports of low thermal conductivities (several mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) across the 2D heterostructures, phonon&#8208;dominant thermal transport remains strong due to the nearly&#8208;ideal contact between the layers. Here, this work experimentally explores the heat transport mechanisms by increasing the interlayer distance from perfect contact to a few nanometers and demonstrates that the phonon&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity across the WS2/graphene interface decreases further with the increasing interlayer distance until the air&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity increases again. This work finds that the resulting tradeoff of the two heat conduction mechanisms leads to the existence of a minimum thermal conductivity at 2.11&#160;nm of 1.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, which is two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously. This work provides an effective methodology for engineering thermal insulation structures and understanding heat transport at the ultimate small scales.

         <title>High&#8208;Fluidity/High&#8208;Strength Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolytes Enable Ultra&#8208;Flexible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Fiber&#8208;Shaped Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
An advanced dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte composed of inner&#8208;layer with high fluidity and outer&#8208;layer with superb strength is tactfully in&#8208;situ constructed on fiber electrodes. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the inner&#8208;layer and outer&#8208;layer gel electrolytes, the fiber&#8208;shaped Zn&#8208;Zn cells with dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte delivered outstanding cyclic performances. This work provides a new perspective in designing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped metal batteries.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs) with intrinsic safety, highcapacity, and superb omnidirectional flexibility hold promise for wearable energy&#8208;supply devices. However, the interfacial separation of fiber&#8208;shaped electrodes and electrolytes caused by Zinc (Zn) stripping process and severe Zn dendrites occurring at the folded area under bending condition seriously restricts FAZIBs' practical application. Here, an advanced confinement encapsulation strategy is originally reported to construct dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte consisting of high&#8208;fluidity polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;Zn acetate inner layer and high&#8208;strength Zn alginate outer layer for fiber&#8208;shaped Zn anode. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of inner&#8208;outer gel electrolyte and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase&#160;on Zn anode surface by lysine additive, the resulting fiber&#8208;shaped Zn&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers long cycling life over 800&#160;h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 with dynamic bending frequency of 0.1&#160;Hz. The finite element simulation further confirms that dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte can effectively suppress the interfacial separation arising from the Zn stripping and bending process. More importantly, a robust twisted fiber&#8208;shaped Zn/zinc hexacyanoferrate battery based on dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte is successfully assembled, achieving a remarkable capacity retention of 97.7% after bending 500 cycles. Therefore, such novel dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte design paves the way for the development of long&#8208;life fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous metal batteries.

         <title>Planar Cation Passivation on Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables High&#8208;Performance 0.35&#8211;1.8&#160;&#181;m Broadband TFT Imager</title>

         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative passivation strategy for large&#8208;size PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), using a planar 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation to face&#8208;to&#8208;face couple on PbS (100) facet and strengthen halide passivation on PbS (111) facet. This effective passivation enables monolithically integrated 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#181;m broadband CQDs TFT imager.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for broadband photodetectors from visible light to shortwave infrared (SWIR). However, large&#8208;size PbS CQDs sensitive to longer SWIR are mainly exposed with nonpolar (100) facets on the surface, which lack robust passivation strategies. Herein, an innovative passivation strategy that employs planar cation, is introduced to enable face&#8208;to&#8208;face coupling on (100) facets and strengthen halide passivation on (111) facets. The defect density of CQDs film (Eg &#8776; 0.74&#160;eV) is reduced from 2.74&#160;&#215;&#160;1015 to 1.04&#160;&#160;&#215;&#160;1015 cm&#8722;3, coupled with 0.1&#160;eV reduction in the activation energy of defects. The resultant CQDs photodiodes exhibit a low dark current density of 14 nA cm&#8722;2 with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 62%, achieving a linear dynamic range of 98&#160;dB, a &#8722;3dB bandwidth of 103&#160;kHz and a detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 Jones. The comprehensive performance of the CQDs photodiodes outperforms previously reported CQDs photodiodes operating at &gt;1.6&#160;&#181;m. By monolithically integrated with thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) readout circuit, the broadband CQDs imager covering 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#181;m realizes the functions including silicon wafer perspectivity and material discrimination, showing its potential for wide range of applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Touch Sensor for Simultaneous Tactile and Slip Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive piezoresistive touch sensor is developed using phase inversion along with the sacrificial template method and used for normal pressure and slip sensing. It can perform multimodal sensing on complex contact states. The output signal is processed using a wavelet transform to obtain the frequency&#8208;domain characteristics of the slip signal and achieve simultaneous detection of pressure and sliding states.








Abstract
Touch is a general term to describe mechanical stimuli. It is extremely difficult to develop touch sensors that can detect different modes of contact forces due to their low sensitivity and data decoupling. Simultaneously conducting tactile and slip sensing presents significant challenges for the design, structure, and performance of sensors. In this work, a highly sensitive sandwich&#8208;structured sensor is achieved by exploiting the porosity and compressive modulus of the sensor's functional layer materials. The sensor shows an ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 1167 kPa&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 1.34&#160;Pa due to its considerably low compression modulus of 23.8&#160;Pa. Due to this ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, coupled with spectral analysis, it allows for dual&#8208;mode detection of both tactile and slip sensations simultaneously. This novel fabrication strategy and signal analysis method provides a new direction for the development of tactile/slip sensors.

         <title>Fully Printable and Reconfigurable Hufu&#8208;type Electroluminescent Devices for Visualized Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enlightened by Hufu (tiger tallies) in ancient China, a reconfigurable electroluminescent (EL) device is realized by assembling two separate parts using an adhesive and stretchable polymer gel composite as transparent electrodes. The incorporation of this reconfigurable feature allows for applications in stretchable displays capable of changing content and visual encryption.








Abstract
Hufu, serving as evidence of imperial authorization in ancient China, comprises two parts in the form of tiger&#8208;shaped tallies that only become effective when matched. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Hufu, a reconfigurable electroluminescent (EL) device is designed by separating conventional integral devices into two parts that contain the EL layer (part A) and the transparent electrode (part B), respectively. The key to realizing such strategy is employing an adhesive and stretchable polymer gel composite as the transparent electrodes for the EL devices. The polymer gel composite facilitates robust yet reversible contact between the EL layer and transparent electrode, enabling high&#8208;performance and stretchable EL devices that can be readily disassembled and reassembled: the EL devices can maintain &#8776;81% of their initial luminance after 1000 times of repeated disassembly and reassembly. Moreover, the precursor ink of the polymer gel composite is compatible with a wide variety of coating and printing technologies, such as spin&#8208;coating, inkjet printing, dispensing, and brush painting. Importantly, the reconfigurable feature of the devices opens up a new path to encryption display systems, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EL encrypted password, and content&#8208;changeable digital clock are demonstrated.

         <title>Structuring Cu Membrane Electrode for Maximizing Ethylene Yield from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding Cu membrane cathode is designed and constructed through the electrochemical deposition of mesoporous copper film on copper foam. This innovative design aims to efficiently facilitate the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 by concurrently addressing the transport of CO2, electrons, ions, water, and products.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic ethylene (C2H4) evolution from CO2 reduction is an intriguing route to mitigate both the energy and environmental crises; however, to acquire industrially relevant high productivity and selectivity at low energy cost remains to be challenging. Membrane assembly electrode has shown great prospect and tailoring its architecture for maximizing C2H4 yield at minimum voltage with long&#8208;term stability becomes critical. Here a freestanding Cu membrane cathode is designed and constructed by electrochemically depositing mesoporous Cu film on Cu foam to simultaneously manage CO2, electron, water, and product transport, which shows an extraordinary C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 85.6% with a full cell power conversion efficiency of 33% at a current density of 368&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, heading the techno&#8208;economic viability for electrocatalytic C2H4 production.

         <title>Atomic Diffusion Engineered PtSnCu Nanoframes with High&#8208;Index Facets Boost Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary PtSnCu active&#8208;site ensembles with enlarged lattice spacings and high&#8208;index facets are achieved by atomic Sn diffusion into the PtCu octopod nanoframes. Benefiting from the single&#8208;atom Sn tailoring, the Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes exhibit ultrahigh and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performances including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward the electrochemical ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrochemical ethanol oxidation is crucial to directly convert a biorenewable liquid fuel with high energy density into electrical energy, but it remains an inefficient reaction even with the best catalysts. To boost ethanol oxidation, developing multimetallic nanoalloy has emerged as one of the most effective strategies, yet faces a challenge in the rational engineering of multimetallic active&#8208;site ensembles at atomic&#8208;level. Herein, starting from typical PtCu nanocrystals, an atomic Sn diffusion strategy is developed to construct well&#8208;defined Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes, which is enclosed by high&#8208;index facets of n (111)&#8208;(111), such as {331} and {221}. Pt47Sn12Cu41 achieves a high mass activity of 3.10 A mg&#8722;1Pt and promotes the C&#8208;C bond breaking and oxidation of poisonous CO intermediate, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory &#65288;DFT&#65289; calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Sn improves the electroactivity by uplifting the d&#8208;band center through the s&#8208;p&#8208;d coupling. Meanwhile, the strong binding of ethanol and the reduced energy barrier of CO oxidation guarantee a highly efficient ethanol oxidation process with improved Faradic efficiency of C1 products. This work offers a promising strategy for constructing novel multimetallic nanoalloys tailored by atomic metal sites as the efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Sensitive Thermochromic Behavior of InSeI, a Highly Anisotropic and Tubular 1D van der Waals Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromism, a solid's temperature&#8208;dependent change in color, is the fundamental basis of optical thermometry. Herein, it is demonstrated that InSeI, a 1D van der Waals solid, shows strong thermochromism and a pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent optical band edge absorption shift from 450 to 530 nm over a 380 K temperature range with an experimental (dEg/dT)max value of 1.26 &#215; 10&#8722;3 eV K&#8722;1.








Abstract
Thermochromism, the change in color of a material with temperature, is the fundamental basis of optical thermometry. A longstanding challenge in realizing sensitive optical thermometers for widespread use is identifying materials with pronounced thermometric optical performance in the visible range. Herein, it is demonstrated that single crystals of indium selenium iodide (InSeI), a 1D van der Waals (vdW) solid consisting of weakly bound helical chains, exhibit considerable visible range thermochromism. A strong temperature&#8208;dependent optical band edge absorption shift ranging from 450 to 530 nm (2.8 to 2.3 eV) over a 380 K temperature range with an experimental (dEg/dT)max value extracted to be 1.26 &#215; 10&#8722;3 eV K&#8722;1 is shown. This value lies appreciably above most dense conventional semiconductors in the visible range and is comparable to soft lattice solids. The authors further seek to understand the origin of this unusually sensitive thermochromic behavior and find that it arises from strong electron&#8211;phonon interactions and anharmonic phonons that significantly broaden band edges and lower the Eg with increasing temperature. The identification of structural signatures resulting in sensitive thermochromism in 1D vdW crystals opens avenues in discovering low&#8208;dimensional solids with strong temperature&#8208;dependent optical responses across broad spectral windows, dimensionalities, and size regimes.

         <title>Metasurface for Engineering Superimposed Ince&#8208;Gaussian Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ince&#8208;Gaussian beams (IGBs) represent the exact and continuous transition modes connecting Laguerre&#8211;Gaussian and Hermite&#8211;Gaussian beams. A single metasurface is used to generate superimposed IGBs through the superposition of even and odd Ince modes. This work addresses critical challenges in IGB research, including light weight, compactness, phase singularity manipulation, and dynamic modulation of polarization singularities.








Abstract
Ince&#8208;Gaussian beams (IGBs) are the third complete family of exact and orthogonal solutions of the paraxial wave equation and have been applied in many fields ranging from particle trapping to quantum optics. IGBs play a very important role in optics as they represent the exact and continuous transition modes connecting Laguerre&#8211;Gaussian and Hermite&#8211;Gaussian beams. The method currently in use suffers from the high cost, complexity, and large volume of the optical system. The superposition of IGBs can generate complicated structured beams with multiple phase and polarization singularities. A metasurface approach is proposed to realizing various superpositions of IGBs without relying on a complicated optical setup. By superimposing IGBs with even and odd modes, multiple phase, and polarization singularities are observed in the resultant beams. The phase and polarization singularities are modulated by setting the initial phase in the design and controlling the incident linear polarization. The compactness of the developed metasurface devices and the unique properties of the generated beams have the potential to impact many practical applications such as particle manipulation, orbital angular momentum spectrum manipulation, and optical communications.

         <title>A Metal Coordination Number Determined Catalytic Performance in Manganese Borides for Ambient Electrolysis of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent Mn&#8208;atom possesses intrinsic capability to synthesize a series of compounds of varied Mn coordination numbers upon reacting with numerous p&#8208;block elements (electron&#8208;deficient B&#8208;atom). Ambient electrocatalytic activity for N2 reduction to NH3 of Mn2B, MnB, MnB2, and MnB4 enhances as Mn coordination numbers increase for MnBx in the neutral electrolyte (0.1 m Li2SO4) as confirmed both experimentally and theoretically.








Abstract
A new strategy that can effectively increase the nitrogen reduction reaction performance of catalysts is proposed and verified by tuning the coordination number of metal atoms. It is found that the intrinsic activity of Mn atoms in the manganese borides (MnBx) increases in tandem with their coordination number with B atoms. Electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms are capable of accepting electrons from Mn atoms, which enhances the adsorption of N2 on the Mn catalytic sites (*) and the hydrogenation of N2 to form *NNH intermediates. Furthermore, the increase in coordination number reduces the charge density of Mn atoms at the Fermi level, which facilitates the desorption of ammonia from the catalyst surface. Notably, the MnB4 compound with a Mn coordination number of up to 12 exhibits a high ammonia yield rate (74.9 &#177; 2.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (38.5 &#177; 2.7%) at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 0.1 m Li2SO4 electrolyte, exceeding those reported for other boron&#8208;related catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Multivalent Mn-atom possesses intrinsic capability to synthesize a series of compounds of varied Mn coordination numbers upon reacting with numerous p-block elements (electron-deficient B-atom). Ambient electrocatalytic activity for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B, MnB, MnB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and MnB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; enhances as Mn coordination numbers increase for MnB&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; in the neutral electrolyte (0.1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as confirmed both experimentally and theoretically.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy that can effectively increase the nitrogen reduction reaction performance of catalysts is proposed and verified by tuning the coordination number of metal atoms. It is found that the intrinsic activity of Mn atoms in the manganese borides (MnB&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) increases in tandem with their coordination number with B atoms. Electron-deficient boron atoms are capable of accepting electrons from Mn atoms, which enhances the adsorption of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Mn catalytic sites (*) and the hydrogenation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form *NNH intermediates. Furthermore, the increase in coordination number reduces the charge density of Mn atoms at the Fermi level, which facilitates the desorption of ammonia from the catalyst surface. Notably, the MnB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound with a Mn coordination number of up to 12 exhibits a high ammonia yield rate (74.9 &#177; 2.1&#160;&#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (38.5 &#177; 2.7%) at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 0.1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, exceeding those reported for other boron-related catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Conduction Dominated Hydrogels for Durable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;conduction dominated hydrogel is engineered based on the anion&#8208;tethered strategy, distinguished by synergistic solvation effect, finely adjusted zinc nucleation properties, and the fortitude of iodine reactions, all with the specific intent of bolstering the durability and reliability of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. This work is believed to push the progress of durable quasi&#8208;solid conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries have the potential to offer high energy&#8208;density aqueous energy storage, but their lifetime is limited by the rampant dendrite growth and the concurrent parasite side reactions on the Zn anode, as well as the shuttling of polyiodides. Herein, a cation&#8208;conduction dominated hydrogel electrolyte is designed to holistically enhance the stability of both zinc anode and iodine cathode. In this hydrogel electrolyte, anions are covalently anchored on hydrogel chains, and the major mobile ions in the electrolyte are restricted to be Zn2+. Specifically, such a cation&#8208;conductive electrolyte results in a high zinc ion transference number (0.81) within the hydrogel and guides epitaxial Zn nucleation. Furthermore, the optimized Zn2+ solvation structure and the reconstructed hydrogen bond networks on hydrogel chains contribute to the reduced desolvation barrier and suppressed corrosion side reactions. On the iodine cathode side, the electrostatic repulsion between negative sulfonate groups and polyiodides hinders the loss of the iodine active material. This all&#8208;round electrolyte design renders zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with high reversibility, low self&#8208;discharge, and long lifespan.

         <title>Controllable Manipulation of Large&#8208;Volume Droplet on Non&#8208;Slippery Surfaces Based on Triboelectric Contactless Charge Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator (DF&#8208;TENG) facilitates contactless charge injection through triboelectric means, introducing a novel method for controllable droplet manipulation. This method is adaptable for a variety of non&#8208;slippery substrates and droplets of different compositions and viscosities, which makes it an ideal strategy for contamination&#8208;free droplet transport, chemical reactions, and even driving solids.








Abstract
Controllable droplet manipulation is crucial in diverse scientific and engineering fields. Traditional electric&#8208;based methods usually rely on commercial high&#8208;voltage (HV) power sources, which are typically bulky, expensive, and potentially hazardous. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a highly studied device that can generate HV output with limited current, showing great potential in droplet manipulation applications. However, current TENG&#8208;based approaches usually utilize traditional free&#8208;standing TENGs that produce short&#8208;pulsed alternating&#8208;current signals. This limitation hinders continuous electrostatic forces necessary for precise droplet control, leading to complex circuitry and suboptimal droplet motion control in terms of volume, distance, direction, and momentum. Here, a triboelectric contactless charge injection (TCCI) method employing a novel dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator (DF&#8208;TENG), is proposed. The DF&#8208;TENG can produce both high voltage and constant current during unidirectional motion, enabling continuous corona discharges for contactless charge injection into the droplets. Using this method, a large&#8208;volume droplet (3000 &#181;L) can be controlled with momentum up to 115.2 g mm s&#8722;1, quintupling the highest value recorded by the traditional methods. Moreover, the TCCI method is adaptable for a variety of non&#8208;slippery substrates and droplets of different compositions and viscosities, which makes it an ideal manipulation strategy for droplet transport, chemical reactions, and even driving solids.

         <title>Switchable Anisotropic/Isotropic Photon Transport in a Double&#8208;Dipole Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Radical&#8208;Controlled Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport behavior is first achieved in a double&#8208;dipole metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), which exhibit tunable output on both polarization (isotropy/anisotropy state) and wavelength information (blue/red&#8208;color emission) triggered by the radical&#8208;controlled energy transfer. These results offer a novel strategy for developing MOF&#8208;based photonic devices with tunable anisotropic performance.








Abstract
Directional control of photon transport at micro/nanoscale holds great potential in developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. Here, the switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport is reported in a double&#8208;dipole metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on radical&#8208;controlled energy transfer. Double&#8208;dipole MOF microcrystals with transition dipole moments perpendicular to each other have been achieved by the pillared&#8208;layer coordination strategy. The energy transfer between the double dipolar chromophores can be modulated by the photogenerated radicals, which permits the in situ switchable output on both polarization (isotropy/anisotropy state) and wavelength information (blue/red&#8208;color emission). On this basis, the original MOF microcrystal with isotropic polarization state displays the isotropic photon transport and similar reabsorption losses at various directions, while the radical&#8208;affected MOF microcrystal with anisotropic polarization state shows the anisotropic photon transport with distinct reabsorption losses at different directions, finally leading to the in situ switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport. These results offer a novel strategy for the development of MOF&#8208;based photonic devices with tunable anisotropic performance.

Nano&#8208;Biopatterning
In article number 2309284 by Haogang Cai, Rishita Changede, and co&#8208;workers, a dielectric nano&#8208;biopatterning technology is developed, enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy that is challenging for conventional plasmonic nanopatterns with quenching effects. Through both simulations and experiments, nanopattern interactions with adjacent fluorescence and surrounding lipid membranes are studied. This technology will facilitate precise quantitative cell biology studies to investigate molecular&#8208;scale signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.

Sensitive Thermochromic Behavior of InSeI
In article number 2312597 by Maxx Q. Arguilla and co&#8208;workers, a highly sensitive visible range thermochromic response is reported for the one&#8208;dimensional van der Waals crystal, InSeI, which features exfoliable chains with a unique tetrahelical motif. The thermochromic sensitivity of these crystals is manifested through well&#8208;resolved temperature&#8208;dependent band edge absorption shifts and a (dEg/dT)max of 1.26 &#215; 10&#8722;30 eV K&#8722;1, making it suitable for optical thermometry at the nanoscale.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions provides a new opportunity for the application of anticancer drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity, becoming a powerful alternative to traditional chemotherapy. The progress of supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions over the past few years is summarized, and illustrates its significant guidance in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is widely recognized as an effective approach for treating cancer due to its ability to eliminate cancer cells using chemotherapeutic drugs. However, traditional chemotherapy suffers from various drawbacks, including limited solubility and stability of drugs, severe side effects, low bioavailability, drug resistance, and challenges in tracking treatment efficacy. These limitations greatly hinder its widespread clinical application. In contrast, supramolecular chemotherapy, which relies on host&#8211;guest interactions, presents a promising alternative by offering highly efficient and minimally toxic anticancer drug delivery. In this review, an overview of recent advancements in supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions is provided. The significant role it plays in guiding cancer therapy is emphasized. Drawing on a wealth of cutting&#8208;edge research, herein, a timely and valuable resource for individuals interested in the field of supramolecular chemotherapy or cancer therapy, is presented. Furthermore, this review contributes to the progression of the field of supramolecular chemotherapy toward clinical application.

Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as powerful building blocks to develop various soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, superior bio&#8208;compatibility, the ability to conduct both electrons and ions, and multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. However, hydrogels are vulnerable to mechanical damage, which limits their usage in developing durable hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics. Self&#8208;healing hydrogels aim to endow bioelectronics with the property of repairing specific functions after mechanical failure, thus improving their durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in self&#8208;healing hydrogels, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, material chemistry, and strategies for multiple properties improvement of hydrogel materials, to the design, fabrication, and applications of various hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics, including wearable physical and biochemical sensors, supercapacitors, flexible display devices, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), implantable bioelectronics, etc. Furthermore, the persisting challenges hampering the development of self&#8208;healing hydrogel bioelectronics and their prospects are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the research and applications of self&#8208;healing hydrogels for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.

Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis provides the most promising avenue for producing value&#8208;added chemicals and consumables from renewable precursors. Over the last decades, PEC catalysis, including reduction of renewable feedstock, oxidation of organics, and activation and functionalization of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;H bonds, are extensively investigated, opening new opportunities for employing the technology in upgrading readily available resources. However, several challenges still remain unsolved, hindering the commercialization of the process. This review offers an overview of PEC catalysis targeted at the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals from sustainable precursors. First, the fundamentals of evaluating PEC reactions in the context of value&#8208;added product synthesis at both anode and cathode are recalled. Then, the common photoelectrode fabrication methods that have been employed to produce thin&#8208;film photoelectrodes are highlighted. Next, the advancements are systematically reviewed and discussed in the PEC conversion of various feedstocks to produce highly valued chemicals. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field are presented. This review aims at facilitating further development of PEC technology for upgrading several renewable precursors to value&#8208;added products and other pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Electrolytes Design for Extending the Temperature Adaptability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: from Fundamentals to Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on electrolytes design for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) from a temperature adaptability perspective. Prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs. Meanwhile, the principles and&#160;limitations of electrolytes design, are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions.








Abstract
With the continuously growing demand for wide&#8208;range applications, lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly required to work under conditions that deviate from room temperature (RT). However, commercial electrolytes exhibit low thermal stability at high temperatures (HT) and poor dynamic properties at low temperatures (LT), hindering the operation of LIBs under extreme conditions. The bottleneck restricting the practical applications of LIBs has promoted researchers to pay more attention to developing a series of innovative electrolytes. This review primarily covers the design of electrolytes for LIBs from a temperature adaptability perspective. First, the fundamentals of electrolytes concerning temperature, including donor number (DN), dielectric constant, viscosity, conductivity, ionic transport, and theoretical calculations are elaborated. Second, prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers in both liquid and solid electrolytes, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs at high or low temperatures. Meanwhile, the principles and limitations of electrolyte design are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions. Finally, a summary and outlook regarding electrolytes design to extend the temperature adaptability of LIBs are proposed.

&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on electrolytes design for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) from a temperature adaptability perspective. Prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs. Meanwhile, the principles and&#160;limitations of electrolytes design, are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the continuously growing demand for wide-range applications, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly required to work under conditions that deviate from room temperature (RT). However, commercial electrolytes exhibit low thermal stability at high temperatures (HT) and poor dynamic properties at low temperatures (LT), hindering the operation of LIBs under extreme conditions. The bottleneck restricting the practical applications of LIBs has promoted researchers to pay more attention to developing a series of innovative electrolytes. This review primarily covers the design of electrolytes for LIBs from a temperature adaptability perspective. First, the fundamentals of electrolytes concerning temperature, including donor number (DN), dielectric constant, viscosity, conductivity, ionic transport, and theoretical calculations are elaborated. Second, prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers in both liquid and solid electrolytes, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs at high or low temperatures. Meanwhile, the principles and limitations of electrolyte design are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions. Finally, a summary and outlook regarding electrolytes design to extend the temperature adaptability of LIBs are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Emitting Metal Halides: Materials, Mechanisms, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An updated overview of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting metal halides, an emerging class of optical materials, is reported. The report is not restricted to cases with perovskite structure only. The various possible mechanisms of light emission, the advances in synthesis (covering both bulk and confined morphologies), and the various applications are discussed and an outlook for the field is provided.








Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low&#8208;cost synthesis, solution processability, and adjustable optical properties. NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, several different types of NIR&#8208;emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, are summarized, and their recent advancement is assessed. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow&#8208;band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. Also, the various applications of NIR&#8208;emitting metal halides are highlighted and an outlook for the field is provided.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Based Mullites for Environmental and Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn&#8208;based mullite oxide AMn2O5 is widely used in environmental treatment and energy conversion over the past decade. This review focuses on its physicochemical properties, synthesis methods, and its applications in environmental treatment, energy conversion, room temperature catalysis, etc. In addition, it might attract attention from other related fields like gas&#8208;sensitive sensing, supercapacitors, and dielectrics.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;based mullite oxides AMn2O5 (A = lanthanide, Y, Bi) is a novel type of ternary catalyst in terms of their electronic and geometric structures. The coexistence of pyramid Mn3+&#8211;O and octahedral Mn4+&#8211;O makes the d&#8208;orbital selectively active toward various catalytic reactions. The alternative edge&#8208; and corner&#8208;sharing stacking configuration constructs the confined active sites and abundant active oxygen species. As a result, they tend to show superior catalytic behaviors and thus gain great attention in environmental treatment and energy conversion and storage. In environmental applications, Mn&#8208;based mullites have been demonstrated to be highly active toward low&#8208;temperature oxidization of CO, NO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), etc. Recent research further shows that mullites decompose O3 and ozonize VOCs from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to room temperature. Moreover, mullites enhance oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and sulfur reduction reactions (SRR), critical kinetic steps in air&#8208;battery and Li&#8211;S batteries, respectively. Their distinctive structures also facilitate applications in gas&#8208;sensitive sensing, ionic conduction, high mobility dielectrics, oxygen storage, piezoelectricity, dehydration, H2O2 decomposition, and beyond. A comprehensive review from basic physicochemical properties to application certainly not only gains a full picture of mullite oxides but also provides new insights into designing heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Strategies to Modulate the Copper Oxidation State Toward Selective C2+ Production in the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have the advantage of producing various products compared to other metal&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, but low selectivity for the desired product remains a challenge. This review introduces effective strategies to increase the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts by controlling the oxidation state of Cu.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to form value&#8208;added chemicals receives considerable attention in recent years. Copper (Cu) is recognized as the only element capable of electro&#8208;reducing CO2 into hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms (C2+), but the low product selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst remains a major technological challenge to overcome. Therefore, identification of the structural features of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of great importance for the highly selective production of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.), and the oxidation state of Cu species in the catalysts is found critical to the catalyst performance. This review introduces recent efforts to fine&#8208;tune the oxidation state of Cu to increase carbon capture and produce specific C2+ compounds, with the intention of greatly expediting the advance in the catalyst designs. It also points to the remaining challenges and fruitful research directions for the development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts that can shape the practical CO2 reduction technology.

         <title>New Prospects Arising from Dynamically Crosslinked Polymers: Reprogramming Their Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked polymers (DCPs) hold immense potential as their geometries can be redefined through network reconfiguration. However, opportunities are emerging to reprogram their properties by harnessing the multifaceted attributes of dynamic chemistries. Here, the strategies to reprogram the properties of DCPs based on latent catalysis, material&#8208;growth, and topology isomerization are discussed, and the recent progress, challenges, and prospects are overviewed.








Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked polymers (DCPs) have gained significant attention owing to their applications in fabricating (re)processable, recyclable, and self&#8208;healable thermosets, which hold great promise in addressing ecological issues, such as plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the current research predominantly focuses on redefining and/or manipulating their geometries while replicating their bulk properties. Given the inherent design flexibility of dynamic covalent networks, DCPs also exhibit a remarkable potential for various novel applications through postsynthesis reprogramming their properties. In this review, the recent advancements in strategies that enable DCPs to transform their bulk properties after synthesis are presented. The underlying mechanisms and associated material properties are overviewed mainly through three distinct strategies, namely latent catalysts, material&#8208;growth, and topology isomerizable networks. Furthermore, the mutual relationship and impact of these strategies when integrated within one material system are also discussed. Finally, the application prospects and relevant issues necessitating further investigation, along with the potential solutions are analyzed.

This exploration sheds light on the promising applications and major challenges of SF&#8208;modified catalysts in hydrogen production and related electrochemical reactions, providing a critical and thorough overview to advance sustainable energy technologies.








Abstract
Green hydrogen, derived from water splitting powered by renewable energy such as solar and wind energy, provides a zero&#8208;emission solution crucial for revolutionizing hydrogen production and decarbonizing industries. Catalysts, particularly those utilizing defect engineering involving the strategical introduction of atomic&#8208;level imperfections, play a vital role in reducing energy requirements and enabling a more sustainable transition toward a hydrogen&#8208;based economy. Stacking fault (SF) defects play an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic processes by reshaping surface reactivity, increasing active sites, improving reactants/product diffusion, and regulating electronic structure due to their dense generation ability and profound impact on catalyst properties. This review explores SF in metal&#8208;based materials, covering synthetic methods for the intentional introduction of SF and their applications in hydrogen production, including oxygen evolution reaction, photo&#8208; and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and various other electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, this review addresses the challenges associated with SF&#8208;based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the properties of SF&#8208;based catalysts to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of their various applications in electrocatalytic processes, providing valuable insights for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Atomic Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the preparation and regulation strategies of engineered single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) and their impact on biocatalytic reactivity. The review delves into recent advancements of SAzymes in biomedical applications from various development mechanisms. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview and future prospects of SAzyme applications in the biological field are provided. This review offers valuable insights of SAzymes in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) showcase not only uniformly dispersed active sites but also meticulously engineered coordination structures. These intricate architectures bestow upon them an exceptional catalytic prowess, thereby captivating numerous minds and heralding a new era of possibilities in the biomedical landscape. Tuning the microstructure of SAzymes on the atomic scale is a key factor in designing targeted SAzymes with desirable functions. This review first discusses and summarizes three strategies for designing SAzymes and their impact on reactivity in biocatalysis. The effects of choices of carrier, different synthesis methods, coordination modulation of first/second shell, and the type and number of metal active centers on the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity are unraveled. Next, a first attempt is made to summarize the biological applications of SAzymes in tumor therapy, biosensing, antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and other biological applications from different mechanisms. Finally, how SAzymes are designed and regulated for further realization of diverse biological applications is reviewed and prospected. It is envisaged that the comprehensive review presented within this exegesis will furnish novel perspectives and profound revelations regarding the biomedical applications of SAzymes.

         <title>Synergistic Brilliance: Engineered Bacteria and Nanomedicine Unite in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 21, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the first systematic and comprehensive review of the development of engineered bacteria in cancer, is provided; and the unique advantages of combining bacteria as anticancer agents with nanomedicines are discussed. This review focuses on the role of bacteria in cancer therapy, integration strategy of bacteria and nanotherapeutic drugs, synergistic mechanism of bacteria and nanomedicines, and bacteria&#8208;synergized multimodal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Engineered bacteria are widely used in cancer treatment because live facultative/obligate anaerobes can selectively proliferate at tumor sites and reach hypoxic regions, thereby causing nutritional competition, enhancing immune responses, and producing anticancer microbial agents in situ to suppress tumor growth. Despite the unique advantages of bacteria&#8208;based cancer biotherapy, the insufficient treatment efficiency limits its application in the complete ablation of malignant tumors. The combination of nanomedicine and engineered bacteria has attracted increasing attention owing to their striking synergistic effects in cancer treatment. Engineered bacteria that function as natural vehicles can effectively deliver nanomedicines to tumor sites. Moreover, bacteria provide an opportunity to enhance nanomedicines by modulating the TME and producing substrates to support nanomedicine&#8208;mediated anticancer reactions. Nanomedicine exhibits excellent optical, magnetic, acoustic, and catalytic properties, and plays an important role in promoting bacteria&#8208;mediated biotherapies. The synergistic anticancer effects of engineered bacteria and nanomedicines in cancer therapy are comprehensively summarized in this review. Attention is paid not only to the fabrication of nanobiohybrid composites, but also to the interpromotion mechanism between engineered bacteria and nanomedicine in cancer therapy. Additionally, recent advances in engineered bacteria&#8208;synergized multimodal cancer therapies are highlighted.

         <title>Progress and Perspective toward Continuous&#8208;Wave Organic Solid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic solid&#8208;state laser under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation is one of the most challenging areas in organic optoelectronics. Recent advances in long&#8208;pulsed organic lasers are comprehensively summarized with respect to molecular designs, optical&#8208;resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet&#8208;contribution strategies. Future directions and perspectives for CW operation are discussed.








Abstract
A continuous&#8208;wave (CW) organic solid&#8208;state laser is highly desirable for spectroscopy, sensing, and communications, but is a significant challenge in optoelectronics. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons and relevant excited&#8208;state absorptions, as well as singlet&#8211;triplet annihilation, are the main obstacles to CW lasing. Here, progress in singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;state utilizations in organic gain media is reviewed to reveal the issues in working with triplets. Then, exciton behaviors that inhibit light oscillations during long excitation pulses are discussed. Further, recent advances in increasing organic lasing pulse widths from microseconds toward the indication of CW operation are summarized with respect to molecular designs, advanced resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet contribution strategies. Finally, future directions and perspectives are proposed for achieving stable CW organic lasers with significant triplet contribution.

         <title>Direct Integration of Perovskite Solar Cells with Carbon Fiber Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of thin&#8208;film photovoltaics with structural components represents an attractive prospect for mobile power applications. In this work, the first example of perovskite solar cells deposited directly onto rigid carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composite substrates is demonstrated, heralding a new class of photocurrent&#8208;generating materials with both high specific strength and power.








Abstract
Integrating photovoltaic devices onto the surface of carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates should create materials with high mechanical strength that are also able to generate electrical power. Such devices are anticipated to find ready applications as structural, energy&#8208;harvesting systems in both the automotive and aeronautical sectors. Here, the fabrication of triple&#8208;cation perovskite n&#8211;i&#8211;p solar cells onto the surface of planarized carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates is demonstrated, with devices utilizing a transparent top ITO contact. These devices also contain a &#8220;wrinkled&#8221; SiO2 interlayer placed between the device and substrate that alleviates thermally induced cracking of the bottom ITO layer. Devices are found to have a maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency of 14.5% and a specific power (power per weight) of 21.4&#160;W&#160;g&#8722;1 (without encapsulation), making them highly suitable for mobile power applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;Shaped CMOS Backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;brightness organic LED arrays are produced by direct vacuum deposition of the organic materials onto complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) backplanes produced in a commercial chip foundry. The composition of the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum anodes is analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and their surface is pre&#8208;conditioned for optimal electrical contact by plasma treatment.








Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g., as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and ultrastable passivation, e.g., to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. In this work, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs are deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy are performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers lead to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitate direct vacuum deposition of orange&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allow each pixel to switch individually. The OLED pixels generate a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2, corresponding to &gt;40&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on a Lateral 0D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved based on a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This leads to deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 21% at a high current density of &#8776;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in 3D perovskites. Here, a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure that can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness&#160;is demonstrated. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Theses LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

         <title>Charge Concentration Limits the Hydrogen Evolution Rate in Organic Nanoparticle Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity shows that the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by aqueous&#8208;soluble organic donor&#8211;acceptor nanoparticles is limited by charge concentration, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition.








Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity is used to compare aqueous&#8208;soluble organic nanoparticle photocatalysts and bulk thin films composed of the same mixture of semiconducting polymer and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor molecule and the relationship between composition, interfacial surface area, charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and photocatalytic activity is examined. The rate of hydrogen evolution reaction by nanoparticles composed of various donor:acceptor blend ratio compositions is quantitatively measured, and it is found that the most active blend ratio displays a hydrogen quantum yield of 0.83% per photon. Moreover, it is found that nanoparticle photocatalytic activity corresponds directly to charge generation, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition. These results suggest that, under the current reaction conditions, with &#8776;3&#215; solar flux, catalytic activity by the nanoparticles is limited by the concentration of electrons and holes in operando and not a finite number of active surface sites or the catalytic rate at the interface. This provides a clear design goal for the next generation of efficient photocatalytic nanoparticles.

         <title>Organic Binary and Ternary Cocrystal Engineering Based on Halogen Bonding Aimed at Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between crystal packing motifs and optical properties of pure organic room temperature phosphorescent (ORTP) cocrystals with halogen bonding is investigated by comparing three different binary cocrystals. By designing ternary cocrystals based on the analysis, a highly efficient ORTP cocrystal with a PLQY of over 20% is achieved.

Recently, there has been intense interest in pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) from cocrystals composed of 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (DITFB) and a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or their derivatives. To expand the possibility of halogen bonding&#8208;based cocrystals, the relationship between the crystal packing motifs and ORTP characteristics in binary cocrystals composed of DITFB and PAHs of phenanthrene (Phen), chrysene (Chry), and pyrene (Pyr), respectively, is investigated. The &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions determine not only the crystal packing motifs but also photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). The Phen&#8208;DITFB and Chry&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystals with&#160;&#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interactions show higher PLQY compared with the Pyr&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystal with &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interaction. Further, to clarify the effect of crystal structures on PLQY, ternary cocrystals are prepared by partially doping Pyr into Phen&#8208;DITFB. The crystal packing motif of the ternary cocrystal originates from a Phen&#8208;DITFB cocrystal with &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction, and some of the Phen sites are randomly replaced with Pyr molecules. The ORTP emission is derived from Pyr. The maximum PLQY is &gt;20% due to suppressing nonradiative decay by changing the crystal packing motif.

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between crystal packing motifs and optical properties of pure organic room temperature phosphorescent (ORTP) cocrystals with halogen bonding is investigated by comparing three different binary cocrystals. By designing ternary cocrystals based on the analysis, a highly efficient ORTP cocrystal with a PLQY of over 20% is achieved. To obtain insight into energy loss, the phosphorescent mechanism is discussed.

         <title>Understanding Effects of Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Density on Polaron Formation Via Electrochemical Doping in Thiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping. In situ monitoring of polaron formation allows identification of its dependence on molecular structures. Understanding of the polaron formation mechanism is important for molecular design rules and its impact on electrical properties.








Abstract
Polarons exist when charges are injected into organic semiconductors due to their strong coupling with the lattice phonons, significantly affecting electronic charge&#8208;transport properties. Understanding the formation and (de)localization of polarons is therefore critical for further developing organic semiconductors as a future electronics platform. However, there are very few studies reported in this area. In particular, there is no direct in situ monitoring of polaron formation and identification of its dependence on molecular structure and impact on electrical properties, limiting further advancement in organic electronics. Herein, how a minor modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping, changing the polymers&#8217; electrical response to the surrounding dielectric environment for gas sensing, is demonstrated. It is found that the reduction in side&#8208;chain density results in a multistep polaron formation, leading to an initial formation of localized polarons in thiophene units without side chains. Reduced side&#8208;chain density also allows the formation of a high density of polarons with fewer polymer structural changes. More numerous but more localized polarons generate a stronger analyte response but without the selectivity between polar and non&#8208;polar solvents, which is different from the more delocalized polarons that show clear selectivity. The results provide important molecular understanding and design rules for the polaron formation and its impact on electrical properties.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Platforms for Manipulating Light with Matter: Strong Light&#8211;Matter Coupling in Fully Solution&#8208;Processed Optical Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully solution&#8208;processed microcavities are demonstrated that allow realizing strong light&#8211;matter coupling with an organic semiconductor, all enabled by a versatile molecular hybrid material that permits the fabrication of dielectric mirrors with high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast between constituting layers.








Abstract
Planar microcavities with strong light&#8211;matter coupling, monolithically processed fully from solution, consisting of two polymer&#8208;based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) comprising alternating layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index titanium oxide hydrate/poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid material and a low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index fluorinated polymer are presented. The DBRs enclose a perylene diimide derivative (b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1) film positioned at the antinode of the optical mode. Strong light&#8211;matter coupling is achieved in these structures at the target excitation of the b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1. Indeed, the energy&#8208;dispersion relation (energy vs in&#8208;plane wavevector or output angle) in reflectance and the group delay of transmitted light in the microcavities show a clear anti&#8208;crossing&#8212;an energy gap between two distinct exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion branches. The agreement between classical electrodynamic simulations of the microcavity response and the experimental data demonstrates that the entire microcavity stack can be controllably produced as designed. Promisingly, the refractive index of the inorganic/organic hybrid layers used in the microcavity DBRs can be precisely manipulated between values of 1.50 to 2.10. Hence, microcavities with a wide spectral range of optical modes might be designed and produced with straightforward coating methodologies, enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the energy and lifetime of the microcavities&#8216; optical modes to harness strong light&#8211;matter coupling in a wide variety of solution processable active materials.

         <title>RAINBOW Organic Solar Cells: Implementing Spectral Splitting in Lateral Multi&#8208;Junction Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAINBOW solar cells consist of two or more junctions placed next to each other and illuminated by spectrally spread sunlight. Guidelines for materials selection are given for this novel geometry through device simulations. Moreover, experimental efficiencies greater than 46% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell are demonstrated for a monolithic two&#8208;junction device based on organic semiconducting absorbers.








Abstract
While multi&#8208;junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading bandgaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub&#8208;cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub&#8208;cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, with narrow, medium, and wide effective bandgaps, and their potential as sub&#8208;cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom&#8208;built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell. Finally, a working proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept monolithic device consisting of two sub&#8208;cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.

         <title>Templated 2D Polymer Heterojunctions for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polymer heterojunctions are formed using a novel templating technique and are investigated as photocatalysts for proton reduction. Templated materials showed improved charge separation and reduced trapped charges at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, which results in hydrogen evolution rates of 3&#8211;9 times that of either individual semiconductor and the ability to produce hydrogen in combination with the oxidation of reversible redox mediators, as well as sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their tunability, charge&#8208;transport properties, and robustness. They are&#160;however&#160;difficult to process and so there are limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work, a novel templating approach is used to combine an imine&#8208;based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between three and nine times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of &gt;20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt&#8208;based redox mediator. This suggests&#160;the improved charge&#8208;separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z&#8208;scheme formation.

&lt;p&gt;2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their tunability, charge-transport properties, and robustness. They are&#160;however&#160;difficult to process and so there are limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work, a novel templating approach is used to combine an imine-based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between three and nine times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of &amp;gt;20&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt-based redox mediator. This suggests&#160;the improved charge-separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z-scheme formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Transparent Electrodes Formed from Template&#8208;Patterned Thin&#8208;Film Silver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>

12&#8208;nm layers of silver deposited on the commercial optical adhesive NOA63 serve as ultrasmooth, haze&#8208;free transparent electrodes for optoelectronics that exhibit high resilience to bending. The electrodes may be readily patterned by selectively etching the NOA63 substrate with an oxygen plasma prior to metal deposition, with the silver forming continuous, conducting regions above unetched NOA63 and fragmented, highly insulating regions above etched NOA63.








Abstract
Template&#8208;patterned, flexible transparent electrodes (TEs) formed from an ultrathin silver film on top of a commercial optical adhesive &#8211; Norland Optical Adhesive 63 (NOA63) &#8211;&#160;are reported. NOA63 is shown to be an effective base&#8208;layer for ultrathin silver films that advantageously prevents coalescence of vapor&#8208;deposited silver atoms into large, isolated islands (Volmer&#8208;Weber growth), and so aids the formation of ultrasmooth continuous films. 12 nm silver films on top of free&#8208;standing NOA63 combine high, haze&#8208;free visible&#8208;light transparency (T &#8776; 60% at 550&#160;nm) with low sheet&#8208;resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$ &#8776; 16 &#937; sq&#8722;1), and exhibit excellent resilience to bending, making them attractive candidates for flexible TEs. Etching the NOA63 base&#8208;layer with an oxygen plasma before silver deposition causes the silver to laterally segregate into isolated pillars, resulting in a much higher sheet resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_{s}$&#160;&gt; 8 &#215; 106 &#937; sq-1) than silver grown on pristine NOA63 . Hence, by selectively etching NOA63 before metal deposition, insulating regions may be defined within an otherwise conducting silver film, resulting in a differentially conductive film that can serve as a patterned TE for flexible devices. Transmittance may be increased (to 79% at 550&#160;nm) by depositing an antireflective layer of Al2O3 on the Ag layer at the cost of reduced flexibility.

         <title>Understanding Causalities in Organic Photovoltaics Device Degradation in a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Throughput Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven high&#8208;throughput workflow for solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells is presented, identifying causal relationships between process conditions and active layer morphology, and between morphology and stability. Using only inexpensive and fast optical probes, quantitative structure&#8211;property relationships are obtained that improve the understanding and control of electrical performance degradation.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) now approach power conversion efficiencies of 20%. However, in order to enter mass markets, problems in upscaling and operational lifetime have to be solved, both concerning the connection between processing conditions and active layer morphology. Morphological studies supporting the development of structure&#8211;process&#8211;property relations are time&#8208;consuming, complex, and expensive to undergo and for which statistics, needed to assess significance, are difficult to be collected. This work demonstrates that causal relationships between processing conditions, morphology, and stability can be obtained in a high&#8208;throughput method by combining low&#8208;cost automated experiments with data&#8208;driven analysis methods. An automatic spectral modeling feeds parametrized absorption data into a feature selection technique that is combined with Gaussian process regression to quantify deterministic relationships linking morphological features and processing conditions with device functionality. The effect of the active layer thickness and the morphological order is further modeled by drift&#8211;diffusion simulations and returns valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms for improving device stability by tuning the microstructure morphology with versatile approaches. Predicting microstructural features as a function of processing parameters is decisive know&#8208;how for the large&#8208;scale production of OSCs.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Semiconducting Graft Copolymers to Achieve &#8220;Clickable&#8221; Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Long Circulation and Specific Cancer Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are a promising tool for theranostic applications. Here, a method of imparting colloidal stability, low&#8208;protein fouling, and high circulation efficiencies onto SPNs is described via a one&#8208;step, postpolymerization reaction. This method can also afford azide&#8208;functionalized SPNs, which allows for subsequent &#8220;click&#8221; reactions to achieve specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#160;(HER2) targeting in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low&#8208;fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole), in a simple one&#8208;step substitution reaction, postpolymerization. Further, by utilizing azide&#8208;functionalized PEG, anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#160;antibodies, antibody fragments, or affibodies are site&#8208;specifically &#8220;clicked&#8221; onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalized SPNs to specifically target HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Outstanding Fill Factor in Inverted Organic Solar Cells with SnO2 by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin oxide as electron transport layer in organic solar cells (OSCs) can promote high device performance and stability. However, the poor quality of the material and of the interface with the organic layer often limits its potential. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;quality tin oxide can be grown by atomic layer deposition, for the fabrication of OSCs with outstanding performance.








Abstract
Transport layers are of outmost importance for thin&#8208;film solar cells, determining not only their efficiency but also their stability. To bring one of these thin&#8208;film technologies toward mass production, many factors besides efficiency and stability become important, including the ease of deposition in a scalable manner and the cost of the different material's layers. Herein, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), in the inverted structure (n&#8208;i&#8208;p), are demonstrated by using as electron transport layer (ETL) tin oxide (SnO2) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is an industrial grade technique which can be applied at the wafer level and also in a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.26% and a record fill factor (FF) of 79% are shown by PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs when using ALD&#8208;SnO2 as ETL. These devices outperform solar cells with SnO2 nanoparticles casted from solution (PCE 16.03%, FF 74%) and also those utilizing the more common sol&#8211;gel ZnO (PCE 16.84%, FF 77%). The outstanding results are attributed to a reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface between the ALD&#8208;SnO2 film and the active layer. Furthermore, a higher stability under illumination is demonstrated for the devices with ALD&#8208;SnO2 in comparison with those utilizing ZnO.

These devices outperform solar cells with SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles casted from solution (PCE 16.03%, FF 74%) and also those utilizing the more common sol&#8211;gel ZnO (PCE 16.84%, FF 77%). The outstanding results are attributed to a reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface between the ALD-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film and the active layer. Furthermore, a higher stability under illumination is demonstrated for the devices with ALD-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison with those utilizing ZnO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Lasers: Cavity Formation and Emission Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review overviews approaches to find an optimal perovskite cavity patterning method, including indirect patterning, bottom&#8208;up patterning, top&#8208;down patterning, and top&#8208;down controlled bottom&#8208;up patterning. Fundamental mechanisms behind various emission behaviors in perovskite thin films and cavities are also compared and contrasted.








Abstract
Hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown remarkable optoelectronic properties as well as facile and cost&#8208;effective processability. With the success of MHP solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes, MHPs have also exhibited great potential as gain media for on&#8208;chip lasers. However, to date, stable operation of optically pumped MHP lasers and electrically driven MHP lasers&#8212;an essential requirement for MHP laser's insertion into chip&#8208;scale photonic integrated circuits&#8212;is not yet demonstrated. The main obstacles include the instability of MHPs in the atmosphere, rudimentary MHP laser cavity patterning methods, and insufficient understanding of emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of different strategies to improve the intrinsic properties of MHPs in the atmosphere and to establish an optimal MHP cavity patterning method. In addition, this review discusses different emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities and how to distinguish them.

To guide the pathway toward the commercialization of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication methods are reviewed to specify the current status and development direction. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when realizing active matrix QLED displays are provided.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit tremendous potential in display technologies owing to their unique optical properties, such as size&#8208;tunable emission wavelength, narrow spectral linewidth, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Significant efforts in academia and industry have achieved dramatic improvements in the performance of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) over the past decade, primarily owing to the development of high&#8208;quality QDs and optimized device architectures. Moreover, sophisticated patterning processes have also been developed for QDs, which is an essential technique for their commercialization. As a result of these achievements, some QD&#8208;based display technologies, such as QD enhancement films and QD&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, have been successfully commercialized, confirming the superiority of QDs in display technologies. However, despite these developments, the commercialization of QLEDs is yet to reach a threshold, requiring a leap forward in addressing challenges and related problems. Thus, representative research trends, progress, and challenges of QLEDs in the categories of material synthesis, device engineering, and fabrication method to specify the current status and development direction are reviewed. Furthermore, brief insights into the factors to be considered when conducting research on single&#8208;device QLEDs are provided to realize active matrix displays. This review guides the way toward the commercialization of QLEDs.

Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided. It starts with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors, and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, the applications of flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces are detailed. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field are summarized.

         <title>Lest We Forget&#8211;The Importance of Heteroatom Interactions in Heterocyclic Conjugated Systems, from Synthetic Metals to Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular heteroatom interactions are well&#8208;known phenomena in organic charge transfer salts and are responsible for bulk metallic conductivity and even superconductivity. In this review, it is seen that the same interactions can be applied in organic semiconductors to increase bulk dimensionality through intermolecular contacts, and control molecular conformation through intramolecular interactions.








Abstract
The field of synthetic metals is, and remains, highly influential for the development of organic semiconductor materials. Yet, with the passing of time and the rapid development of conjugated materials in recent years, the link between synthetic metals and organic semiconductors is at risk of being forgotten. This review reflects&#160;on one of the key concepts developed in synthetic metals &#8211; heteroatom interactions. The application of this strategy in recent organic semiconductor materials, small molecules and polymers, is highlighted, with analysis of X&#8208;ray crystal structures and comparisons with model systems used to determine the influence of these non&#8208;covalent short contacts. The case is made that the wide range of effective heteroatom interactions and the high performance that has been achieved in devices from organic solar cells to transistors is testament to the seeds sown by the synthetic metals research community.

         <title>Broadband Photodetectors and Imagers in Stretchable Electronics Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 20, May 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of optical devices capable of detecting a wide range of wavelengths with stretchable packaging enables internal evaluations for health conditions and abnormalities of targeted living bodies and various objects without experiencing mechanical stress from an arbitrary surface. This review introduces the trends and detailed techniques of materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems.








Abstract
The integration of flexible electronics with optics can help realize a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of a smart society wherein internal evaluations can be easily performed nondestructively from the surface of various objects that is used or encountered in daily lives. Here, organic&#8208;material&#8208;based stretchable optical sensors and imagers that possess both bending capability and rubber&#8208;like elasticity are reviewed. The latest trends in nondestructive evaluation equipment that enable simple on&#8208;site evaluations of health conditions and abnormalities are discussed without subjecting the targeted living bodies and various objects to mechanical stress. Real&#8208;time performance under real&#8208;life conditions is becoming increasingly important for creating smart societies interwoven with optical technologies. In particular, the terahertz (THz)&#8208;wave region offers a substance&#8208; and state&#8208;specific fingerprint spectrum that enables instantaneous analyses. However, to make THz sensors accessible, the following issues must be addressed: broadband and high&#8208;sensitivity at room temperature, stretchability to follow the surface movements of targets, and digital transformation compatibility. The materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems used to overcome these issues are discussed in detail. Ultimately, stretchable optical sensors and imagers with highly sensitive and broadband THz sensors can facilitate the multifaceted on&#8208;site evaluation of solids, liquids, and gases.

         <title>CVD Synthesis of Twisted Bilayer WS2 with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted bilayer transitionmetal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform for investigating intriguing fundamental physical properties. A tilted SiO2/Si substrate is introduced into chemical vapordeposition to synthesize twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. The strong correlation between the SHG response and the twist angle suggests atunable SHG performance with twist angles.








Abstract
The introduction of rotational freedom by twist angles in twisted bilayer (TB) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can tailor the inherent properties of the TMDCs, which provides a promising platform to investigate the exotic physical properties. However, direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality TB&#8208;TMDCs with full twist angles is significantly challenging due to the substantial energy barriers during crystal growth. Here, a modified chemical vapor deposition strategy is proposed to synthesize TB&#8208;WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0&#176; to 120&#176;. Utilizing a tilted SiO2/Si substrate, a gas flow disturbance is generated in the furnace tube to create a heterogeneous concentration gradient of the metal precursor, which provides an extra driving force for the growth of TB&#8208;WS2. The Raman and photoluminescence results confirm a weak interlayer coupling of the TB&#8208;WS2. High&#8208;quality periodic Moir&#233; patterns are observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Moreover, owing to the strong correlation between the nonlinear optical response and the twisted crystal structure, tunable second harmonic generation behaviors are realized in the TB&#8208;WS2. This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality and pristine TB&#8208;TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.

         <title>Probing Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanostructures Using STEM&#8208;EELS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbolic shear polaritons are observed in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The propagation and reflection of polariton modes are studied. The tunable broad spectral polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 expand the scope of &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 from its application in traditional electronic devices to applications in nanophotonics and metamaterials.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, quasiparticles arising from strong coupling between electromagnetic waves and optical phonons, have potential for applications in subdiffraction imaging, sensing, thermal conduction enhancement, and spectroscopy signal enhancement. A new class of phonon polaritons in low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic crystals, hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs), have been verified recently in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 by free electron laser (FEL) measurements. However, detailed behaviors of HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures still remain unknown. Here, by using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy, the experimental observation of multiple HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 in the mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and far&#8208;infrared (FIR) ranges is reported. HShPs in various &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanorods and a &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanodisk are excited. The frequency&#8208;dependent rotation and shear effect of HShPs reflect on the distribution of EELS signals. The propagation and reflection of HShPs in nanostructures are clarified by simulations of electric field distribution. These findings suggest that, with its tunable broad spectral HShPs, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 is an excellent candidate for nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Enhanced Chemoradiotherapy for MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis Using Immunomodulatory Polymer&#8208;Reinforced Nanotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanoradiosensitizer with improved light penetration depth for enhanced chemoradiotherapy effect to reverse immunosuppression in the biofilm&#8208;caused poorly innate immunity area and to eliminate MRSA&#8208;infected deep&#8208;tissue infections. The polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics in the rat osteomyelitis model verify that chemoradiotherapy expresses an excellent modality for deep&#8208;tissue infection management and a promising immunomodulatory treatment to enhance the therapeutic effects of bacterial infections.








Abstract
The eradication of osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge due to its development of biofilm&#8208;induced antibiotic resistance and impaired innate immunity, which often leads to frequent surgical failure. Here, the design, synthesis, and performance of X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics that modulate the immunological properties of infectious microenvironments to enhance chemoradiotherapy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial deep&#8208;tissue infections are reported. Upon X&#8208;ray radiation, the proposed polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutic generates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. To robustly eradicate MRSA biofilms at deep infection sites, these species can specifically bind to MRSA and penetrate biofilms for enhanced chemoradiotherapy treatment. X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated nanotherapeutics modulate the innate immunity of macrophages to prevent the recurrence of osteomyelitis. The remarkable anti&#8208;infection effects of these nanotherapeutics are validated using a rat osteomyelitis model. This study demonstrates the significant potential of a synergistic chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy method for treating MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected osteomyelitis.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is proven to exist in violet phosphorus nanosheets by photoluminescence, and the modulation rates enter a good agreement with the theoretical values. The underlying mechanism is clarified by first&#8208;principle calculations that the strain&#8208;induced asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions plays a crucial role in the nonmonotonic modulation. 








Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well&#8208;predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under varying strain. Here, a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus (VP) nanosheets is observed, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which is reported in a few other 2D materials in knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 and &#8722;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials toward optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

         <title>Customized Intranasal Hydrogel Delivering Methylene Blue Ameliorates Cognitive Dysfunction against Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus&#8208;methylene blue (BP&#8208;MB) is continuously released from intranasal BP&#8208;MB@Gel and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating the neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.









Abstract
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, the treatment of AD remains challenging owning to the hindrance caused by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the complex pathology of AD. Nasal delivery represents an effective means of circumventing the BBB and delivering drugs to the brain. In this study, black phosphorus (BP) is used as a drug carrier, as well as an antioxidant, and loaded with a tau aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), to obtain BP&#8208;MB. For intranasal (IN) delivery, a thermosensitive hydrogel is fabricated by cross&#8208;linking carboxymethyl chitosan and aldehyde Pluronic F127 (F127&#8208;CHO) micelles. The BP&#8208;MB nanocomposite is incorporated into the hydrogel to obtain BP&#8208;MB@Gel. BP&#8208;MB@Gel could be injected intranasally, providing high nasal mucosal retention and controlled drug release. After IN administration, BP&#8208;MB is continuously released and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of AD. These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.

         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high porous SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br, synthesized via a slow&#8208;knitting method using DBM as both solvent and cross&#8208;linker under low dosage of an AlCl3 catalyst, exhibits the highest surface area among the reported HCPs and an impressive performance in high&#8208;pressure methane storage and delivery, which provides a feasible and efficient approach for the scalable production of high&#8208;porosity HCPs with a dynamic&#8208;level control.








Abstract
Hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with ultra&#8208;high porosity, superior physicochemical stability, and excellent cost&#8208;effectiveness are attractive candidates for methane storage. However, the construction of HCPs with BET surface areas exceeding 3000 m2 g&#8722;1 remains extremely challenging. In this work, a newly developed DBM&#8208;knitting method with a slow&#8208;knitting rate is employed to increase the cross&#8208;linking degree, in which dichloromethane (DCM) is replaced by dibromomethane (DBM) as both solvent and electrophilic cross&#8208;linker, resulting in highly porous and physicochemically stable HCPs. The BET surface areas of DBM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Br are 44%&#8211;120% higher than that of DCM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Cl using the same building blocks. Remarkably, SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br exhibits an unprecedentedly high porosity (SBET = 3120&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) among reported HCPs, and shows a competitive volumetric 5&#8211;100&#160;bar working methane capacity of 191 cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 273&#160;K calculated by using real packing density, which outperforms sate&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;organic framework (MOFs) at comparable conditions. This facile and versatile low&#8208;knitting&#8208;rate strategy enables effective improvement in the porosity of HCPs for porosity&#8208;desired applications.

         <title>Triphenylamine Spirofunctionalized Light&#8208;Emitting Conjugated Polymer with an Ultradeep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Emission for Large&#8208;Area Printed Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

Large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coated ultradeep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are fabricated based on triphenylamine spirofunctionalized polydiarylfluorenes (POPSAF). POPSAF present a&#160;stable narrowband emissionand good charge transport behavior. Large&#8208;area printed PLEDs are constructed with an uniform emission of full width at half maximum &#8776;36&#160;nm and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage of (0.155, 0.072) for preliminary passive matrix PLED display.








Abstract
Emerging printed large&#8208;area polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are essential for manufacturing flat&#8208;panel displays and solid lighting devices. However, it is challenging to obtain large&#8208;area and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue PLEDs because of the lack of light&#8208;emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) with robust deep&#8208;blue emissions, excellent morphological stabilities, and high charging abilities. Here, a novel unsymmetrically substituted polydiarylfluorene (POPSAF) is obtained with stable narrowband emission for large&#8208;area printed displays via triphenylamine (TPA) spirofunctionalization of LCPs. POPSAF films show narrowband and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 36&#160;nm, associated with their intrachain excitonic behavior without obvious polaron formation. Compared to controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPF), excellent charge transport is observed in the POPSAF films because of the intrinsic hole transport ability of the TPA units. Large&#8208;area PLEDs are fabricated via blade&#8208;coating with an emission area of 9 cm2, which exhibit uniform ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with an FWHM of 36&#160;nm and corresponding Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.155, 0.072). These findings are attributed to the synergistic effects of robust emission, stable morphology, and printing capacity. Finally, preliminary printed passive matrix (PM) PLED displays with 20 &#215; 20 pixels monochromes are fabricated, confirmed the effectiveness of spirofunctionalization in optoelectronics.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Driven Proton Sponge Nano&#8208;Assembly for Imaging and Triggering Lysosome&#8208;Regulated Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton sponge nano&#8208;assembly (PSNA) is optimized with self&#8208;assembly dependent fluorescence, positive charge density, and cell cytotoxicity. PSNA triggers immunogenic cell death (e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) of tumor cells, followed by the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens, danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of dendritic cells by these molecules.








Abstract
Triggering lysosome&#8208;regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212;a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano&#8208;assemblies (PSNAs) with self&#8208;assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity are created. Such PSNAs are constructed via low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched PEI covalently bound to self&#8208;assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;PyTPE leads to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self&#8208;assembly tendency of PSNAs is further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies reveal that the lysosome rupturing&#8208;regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA&#8208;triggered ICD activate immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.

         <title>Dislodgement of Hydrogen Bubbles in Microchannels with Embedded Pillars: An Analytical, Experimental, and Numerical Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the fundamental behavior, forces, and interactions between entrapped gas bubbles and microchannels are provided. These microchannels include porous structures at the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Here, analytical, experimental, and numerical investigations are employed to present balanced and unbalanced conditions for gas bubble interfaces. This enables, in specific cases, bubble dislodgment at low pressure loads while enhancing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.








Abstract
Microchannels with integrated pillars have enhanced the production capabilities and performance of various applications due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. However, emerging gas bubbles can become trapped, potentially limiting the functionality or efficiency of the device when scaled down to the low&#8208;micrometer scale. Understanding the conditions required to dislodge these bubbles is thus critical for optimizing microfluidic devices with complex physical behaviors. Here an analytical model is presented that outlines the dislodgment conditions and driving forces for such gas&#8211;liquid flows. These terms are derived from the gas&#8211;liquid interface properties, geometry, and processing parameters. As the density of the pillar arrangement is scaled down, the resistance to bubble dislodgment typically increases. Nevertheless, the bubble is compelled to dislodge at lower pressure loads when critical volumes are reached. This newly discovered effect is particularly noticeable in densely packed arrays and can be explained by the interplay of increased surface tension, geometrical restrictions, and volume&#8208;preserving forces. The analytical terms and effects are validated through novel experimental and numerical methods tailored for microchannels in the low&#8208;micrometer scale, showing strong agreement.

         <title>2D Lateral Heterojunction Arrays with Tailored Interface Band Bending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a new strategy, using semiconducting monolayers of Si2Te2 and Sb2Te3, for the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunction arrays with tunable interfacial band alignment. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the continuous lattice of the two&#8208;dimensional&#160;Si2Te2/Sb2Te3 lateral heterojunctions and directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well&#8208;defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si2Te2 grown on Sb2Te3 (ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3) and one&#8208;quintuple&#8208;layer Sb2Te3 grown on monolayer Si2Te2 (1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2) on a p&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 substrate. The site&#8208;specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick&#8208;Sb2Te3, ML&#8208;Si2Te2, and 1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3 films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's p&#8208;doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface. This reported strategy opens avenues for advancing lateral epitaxy technology, facilitating practical applications of 2D in&#8208;plane heterojunctions.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly known as radioenhancers, HfO2 nanoparticles reported in the study present surprising radioprotection in mice and rabbits, along with selective organ&#8208;targeting through fine&#8208;tuned synthesis. These multienzyme&#8208;mimicking agents can be visualized by spectral computed tomography with improved half&#8208;life and stability over amifostine. The protective mechanisms involve inhibiting DNA damage and inflammation and attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades.








Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, radiosensitivity indices are evaluated of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) are rationally designed via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation&#8208;induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. A universal methodology is proposed to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.

         <title>Enhancing CAR Macrophage Efferocytosis Via Surface Engineered Lipid Nanoparticles Targeting LXR Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a novel approach to address efferocytosis disruption in atherosclerosis. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages are engineered to target and engulf resistant apoptotic cells, with reactive oxygen species responsive nanoparticles enhancing their efficacy. This innovative cell therapy platform shows promise in promoting lipid efflux and reducing inflammation, offering the potential for advanced cardiovascular disease treatments.








Abstract
The removal of dying cells, or efferocytosis, is an indispensable part of resolving inflammation. However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis&#8208;resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR&#8208;Ms can transmigrate within a mico&#8208;fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment. The developed platform has the potential to contribute to the advancement of next&#8208;generation cardiovascular disease therapies and further studies include in vivo experiments.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. Their electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction is enhanced through the exsolution Ni nanoparticles enhanced by electrochemical poling and coupled with Mn codoping. Mn dopants enable more flexible coordination, facilitating oxygen ion migration resulting in more Ni nanoparticles and improved adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules.








Abstract
In this study, perovskite oxides La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05MnxTi0.95&#8722;xO3&#8722;&#947; (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10) are investigated as potential solid oxide electrolysis cell cathode materials. The catalytic activity of these cathodes toward CO2 reduction reaction is significantly enhanced through the exsolution of highly active Ni nanoparticles, driven by applying a current of 1.2 A in 97% CO2 &#8211; 3% H2O. The performance of La0.3Ca0.6Ni0.05Ti0.95O3&#8722;&#947; is notably improved by co&#8208;doping with Mn. Mn dopants enhance the reducibility of Ni, a crucial factor in promoting the in situ exsolution of metallic nanocatalysts in perovskite (ABO3) structures. This improvement is attributed to Mn dopants enabling more flexible coordination, resulting in higher oxygen vacancy concentration, and facilitating oxygen ion migration. Consequently, a higher density of Ni nanoparticles is formed. These oxygen vacancies also improve the adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO2 molecules. The dual doping strategy provides enhanced performance without degradation observed after 133&#160;h of high&#8208;temperature operation, suggesting a reliable cathode material for CO2 electrolysis.

This improvement is attributed to Mn dopants enabling more flexible coordination, resulting in higher oxygen vacancy concentration, and facilitating oxygen ion migration. Consequently, a higher density of Ni nanoparticles is formed. These oxygen vacancies also improve the adsorption, desorption, and dissociation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The dual doping strategy provides enhanced performance without degradation observed after 133&#160;h of high-temperature operation, suggesting a reliable cathode material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymorphic Self&#8208;Assembly with Procedural Flexibility for Monodisperse Quaternary Protein Structures of DegQ Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As smart building blocks, proteins can create quaternary structures in polymorphic configurations determined by soft clients. In the present study, highly monodisperse, one&#8208;way clustering is programmed by the protomer, DegQ, featuring procedural flexibility in the self&#8208;assembly procedure. First high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of DegQ are presented, validating the feasibility and flexibility of programming proteins with native robot&#8208;like functions.








Abstract
As large molecular tertiary structures, some proteins can act as small robots that find, bind, and chaperone target protein clients, showing the potential to serve as smart building blocks in self&#8208;assembly fields. Instead of using such intrinsic functions, most self&#8208;assembly methodologies for proteins aim for de novo&#8208;designed structures with accurate geometric assemblies, which can limit procedural flexibility. Here, a strategy enabling polymorphic clustering of quaternary proteins, exhibiting simplicity and flexibility of self&#8208;assembling paths for proteins in forming monodisperse quaternary cage particles is presented. It is proposed that the enzyme protomer DegQ, previously solved at low resolution, may potentially be usable as a threefold symmetric building block, which can form polyhedral cages incorporated by the chaperone action of DegQ in the presence of protein clients. To obtain highly monodisperse cage particles, soft, and hence, less resistive client proteins, which can program the inherent chaperone activity of DegQ to efficient formations of polymorphic cages, depending on the size of clients are utilized. By reconstructing the atomic resolution cryogenic electron microscopy DegQ structures using obtained 12&#8208; and 24&#8208;meric clusters, the polymorphic clustering of DegQ enzymes is validated in terms of soft and rigid domains, which will provide effective routes for protein self&#8208;assemblies with procedural flexibility.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene, which exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, and thus has important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.








Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer&#160;hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (BH&#8208;UPE), which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interlinking, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface&#8208;modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly interlinked with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;UPE interchain entanglement and bonding. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and hydrophilic initiator to p.p.m. levels.&#160;Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface&#8208;modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous&#160;surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, BH&#8208;UPE exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, demonstrating great potential as an advanced bearing material for disc prosthesis. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired Design of S&#8208;Synergized Fe&#8211;Fe Dual&#8208;Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, iron&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal center catalysts are strategically designed and fabricated by mimicking ferredoxin, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the single Fe sites as the &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for precise modulation of the electronic structure. Thereby, balancing the adsorption/desorption behavior of the reaction intermediates, and accelerating the overall reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in&#8208;depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, Fe&#8208;based DMCs (Fe2N6&#8208;S) are strategically designed and fabricated, in which additional Fe and S sites are synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse&#8208; and fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as&#8208;prepared Fe2N6&#8208;S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zinc&#8208;air (Zn&#8211;air) battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O2 adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#9472;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d&#8208;band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate&#8208;determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Bioresorbable Multilayer Organic&#8211;Inorganic Films for Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer design strategy for bioresorbable encapsulating structures that serve as water barriers for electronic systems. This approach not only protects implantable electronic devices from biofluids to ensure reliable operational performance but also enables favorable degradation after a desired period of use. This materials system&#160;may find broad and immediate applications for a range of practical electronic devices that are capable of resorption in biological and environmental settings.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronic devices as temporary biomedical implants represent an emerging class of technology relevant to a range of patient conditions currently addressed with technologies that require surgical explantation after a desired period of use. Obtaining reliable performance and favorable degradation behavior demands materials that can serve as biofluid barriers in encapsulating structures that avoid premature degradation of active electronic components. Here, this work presents a materials design that addresses this need, with properties in water impermeability, mechanical flexibility, and processability that are superior to alternatives. The approach uses multilayer assemblies of alternating films of polyanhydride and silicon oxynitride formed by spin&#8208;coating and plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies investigate the effects of material composition and multilayer structure on water barrier performance, water distribution, and degradation behavior. Demonstrations with inductor&#8208;capacitor circuits, wireless power transfer systems, and wireless optoelectronic devices illustrate the performance of this materials system as a bioresorbable encapsulating structure.

         <title>150 Gbps THz Chipscale Topological Photonic Diplexer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip photonic diplexer for sixth to X generation communication works on the principle of power splitting and terahertz spectrum filtering. The topological nature of the silicon chip facilitates simultaneous multiplexing and demultiplexing of the two broadband 12.5 GHz channels (CH1 and CH2) to support an aggregated data speed of 150 Gbps.








Abstract
Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on&#8208;chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into nonoverlapping multicarrier frequency sub&#8208;bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency&#8208;selective time&#8208;invariant channels. Here, an on&#8208;chip topological diplexer is reported exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunneling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high&#8208;speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit&#160;s&#8722;1. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Assisted Generation and Straight Movement of Skyrmion Bubble in Kagome TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise generation and straight movement of skyrmion bubble are demonstrated at zero field and room temperature in the Kagome plane of TbMn6Sn6 by conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating, where the crucial contribution of local anisotropy variation near the spin reorientation transition and geometric confinement is validated in simulation, highlighting a significant possibility for the compatible application in skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic textures are promising candidates as binary data units for the next&#8208;generation memory device. The precise generation and convenient control of nontrivial spin topology at zero field near room temperature endows the critical advantages in skyrmionic devices but is not simultaneously integrated into one material. Here, in the Kagome plane of quantum TbMn6Sn6, the expedient generation of the skyrmion bubbles in versatile forms of lattice, chain, and isolated one by converging the electron beam, where the electron intensity gradient contributes to the dynamic generation from local anisotropy variation near spin reorientation transition (SRT) is reported. Encouragingly, by utilizing the dynamic shift of the SRT domain interface, the straight movement is actualized with the skyrmion bubble slave to the SRT domain interface forming an elastic composite object, avoiding the usual deflection from the skyrmion Hall effect. The critical contribution of the SRT domain interface via conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating is further theoretically validated in micromagnetic simulation, highlighting the compatible application possibility in advanced devices.

         <title>Resonant Band Hybridization in Alloyed Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. Here, this approach is applied to van der Waals heterostructures built from semiconducting monolayers of MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy and WSe2 (or MoSe2). Interlayer exciton photoluminescence monitors the bandstructure modifications as a function of alloy composition x. Strong bandstructure hybridization is unveiled leading to a transition from direct to indirect bandgap for x&lt;0.6 in MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2 heterostructures.








Abstract
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilized for achieving optimized performance in modern semiconductor devices. While alloying has been studied in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, its application in van der Waals heterostructures built from atomically thin layers is largely unexplored. Here, heterobilayers made from monolayers of WSe2 (or MoSe2) and MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2 alloy are fabricated and nontrivial tuning of the resultant bandstructure is observed as a function of concentration x. This evolution is monitored by measuring the energy of photoluminescence (PL) of the interlayer exciton (IX) composed of an electron and hole residing in different monolayers. In MoxW1 &#8722; xSe2/WSe2, a strong IX energy shift of &#8776;100 meV is observed for x varied from 1 to 0.6. However, for x &lt; 0.6 this shift saturates and the IX PL energy asymptotically approaches that of the indirect bandgap in bilayer WSe2. This observation is theoretically interpreted as the strong variation of the conduction band K valley for x &gt; 0.6, with IX PL arising from the K &#8722; K transition, while for x &lt; 0.6, the bandstructure hybridization becomes prevalent leading to the dominating momentum&#8208;indirect K &#8722; Q transition. This bandstructure hybridization is accompanied with strong modification of IX PL dynamics and nonlinear exciton properties. This work provides foundation for bandstructure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures highlighting the importance of hybridization effects and opening a way to devices with accurately tailored electronic&#160;properties.

         <title>Controlled Refolding of Denatured IL&#8208;12 Using In Situ Antigen&#8208;Capturing Nanochaperone Remarkably Reduces the Systemic Toxicity and Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled nanochaperone (P&#8208;nChap) is designed as in situ antigen capturing nanovaccine to enhance cytokine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. P&#8208;nChap effectively avoids on&#8208;target, off&#8208;tumor toxicity of IL&#8208;12 by delivering its denatured form, which can be only refolded into native states in response to tumor microenvironment. Moreover, P&#8208;nChap releases PTX to produce ICD, captures TAAs and transports to DCs to facilitate antigen cross&#8208;presentation.








Abstract
Cytokines are powerful in cancer immunotherapy, however, their therapeutic potential is limited by the severe systemic toxicity. Here a potent strategy to reduce the toxicity of systemic cytokine therapy by delivering its denatured form using a finely designed nanochaperone, is described. It is demonstrated that even if the denatured protein cargos are occasionally released under normal physiological conditions they are still misfolded, while can effectively refold into native states and release to function in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the systemic toxicity of cytokines is nearly completely overcome. Moreover, an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic is further loaded and delivered to tumor using this nanochaperone to trigger the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) that are subsequently captured in situ by nanochaperone and then reflows into lymph nodes (LNs) to promote antigen cross&#8208;presentation. This optimized personalized nanochaperone&#8208;vaccine demonstrates unprecedented suppressive effects against large, advanced tumors, and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy results in a significant abscopal effect and inhibition of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hence, this approach provides a simple and universal delivery strategy to reduce the systemic toxicities of cytokines, as well as provides a robust personalized cancer vaccination platform, which may find wide applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Defect&#8208;Driven Synergistic Synaptic Heterostructures for Gate&#8208;Free Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

An innovative gate&#8208;free Fe7S8@MoS2 heterostructure wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell is developed to realize the effective photocarrier trapping through the exploitation of intrinsic defects in the Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system.








Abstract
The optoelectronic synaptic devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer great advances for future neuromorphic visual systems with dramatically improved integration density and power efficiency. The effective charge capture and retention are considered as one vital prerequisite to realizing the synaptic memory function. However, the current 2D synaptic devices are predominantly relied on materials with artificially&#8208;engineered defects or intricate gate&#8208;controlled architectures to realize the charge trapping process. These approaches, unfortunately, suffer from the degradation of pristine materials, rapid device failure, and unnecessary complication of device structures. To address these challenges, an innovative gate&#8208;free heterostructure paradigm is introduced herein. The heterostructure presents a distinctive dome&#8208;like morphology wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell (Fe7S8@MoS2), allowing the realization of effective photocarrier trapping through the intrinsic defects in the adjacent Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors with memory time up to &#8776;800 s under single optical pulse, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system with significantly improved image recognition efficiency. The emergence of such heterostructures foreshadows a promising trajectory for underpinning future synaptic devices, catalyzing the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and intricate visual processing applications.

         <title>A Gas Therapy Strategy for Intestinal Flora Regulation and Colitis Treatment by Nanogel&#8208;Based Multistage NO Delivery Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to regulate the intestinal microbiota for the colitis treatment by targeting inflamed tissues to release NO. This microcapsule exhibits good resistance to digestive fluids and the nanogel has good inflammation targeting and NO release properties. In vivo experiments show that the gas therapy strategy modulates intestinal microbiota, reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal repair.








Abstract
Current approaches to treating inflammatory bowel disease focus on the suppression of overactive immune responses, the removal of reactive intestinal oxygen species, and regulation of the intestinal flora. However, owing to the complex structure of the gastrointestinal tract and the influence of mucus, current small&#8208;molecule and biologic&#8208;based drugs for treating colitis cannot effectively act at the site of colon inflammation, and as a result, they tend to exhibit low efficacies and toxic side effects. In this study, nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to achieve NO release at the inflammation site by targeting the inflammatory tissues using the nanogel. Surprisingly, oral administration of the microcapsules suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria and increases the abundance of probiotic bacteria. Metabolomics further show that an increased abundance of intestinal probiotics promotes the production of metabolites, including short&#8208;chain fatty acids and indole derivatives, which modulate the intestinal immunity and restore the intestinal barrier via the interleukin&#8208;17 and PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways. This work reveals that the developed gas therapy strategy based on multistage NO delivery microcapsules modulates the intestinal microbial balance, thereby reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal barrier repair, ultimately providing a new therapeutic approach for the clinical management of colitis.

         <title>In Situ Mitochondrial Biomineralization for Drug&#8208;Free Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mitochondrial biomineralization approach is developed, where the mitochondrial targeted nanosystem is activated via near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation as a burst source of PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ for drug&#8208;free cancer therapy.








Abstract
The common clinical chemotherapy often brings serious side effects to patients, mainly due to the off&#8208;target and leakage of toxic drugs. However, this is fatal for some specific clinical tumors, such as brain tumors and neuroma. This study performs a drug&#8208;free approach by encapsulating black phosphorus (BP) and calcium peroxide (CaO2) in liposomes with surface&#8208;modified triphenylphosphonium (BCLT) to develop mitochondria targeting calcification for cancer therapy without damaging normal cells. BCLT preferentially accumulates inside tumor mitochondria and then is activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to produce abundant PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ to accelerate in situ mitochondrial mineralization, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell death. More importantly, both PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ are essential components of metabolism in the body, and random gradient diffusion or premature leakage does not cause damage to adjacent normal cells. This achievement promises to be an alternative to conventional chemotherapy in clinical practice for many specific tumor types.

The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis. The results illustrated the remarkable therapeutic effects of the two nanoparticles on liver fibrosis, along with their excellent targeting and biosafety properties.

         <title>Gold Recovery from E&#8208;Waste by Food&#8208;Waste Amyloid Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative approach to recover gold from e&#8208;waste using protein amyloid aerogels derived from food waste. These aerogels demonstrate exceptional gold adsorption capabilities, transforming gold ions into gold single crystals at the microscopic level and yielding a high&#8208;purity 22&#8208;carat gold nugget in bulk, demonstrating an eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective potential for gold recovery.








Abstract
Demand for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste grows steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource&#8208;intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side&#8208;stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste. To do so, AF aerogels are prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in waste electrical and electronic equipment (e&#8208;waste). The results demonstrate that AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1) and selectivity, making it efficient and an adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from e&#8208;waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high&#8208;purity gold nuggets, constituted by &#8776;90.8&#160;wt% gold (21&#8211;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8211;economic analysis of the process finally consolidate the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side&#8208;streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste.

These aerogels demonstrate exceptional gold adsorption capabilities, transforming gold ions into gold single crystals at the microscopic level and yielding a high-purity 22-carat gold nugget in bulk, demonstrating an eco-friendly and cost-effective potential for gold recovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for gold recovery from e-waste grows steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource-intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side-stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from e-waste. To do so, AF aerogels are prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste). The results demonstrate that AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and selectivity, making it efficient and an adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from e-waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high-purity gold nuggets, constituted by &#8776;90.8&#160;wt% gold (21&#8211;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8211;economic analysis of the process finally consolidate the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side-streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>22% Record Efficiency in Nanorod Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Achieved by Gradient Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency nanorod light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (NR&#8208;LEDs) are fabricated using CdSe/CdZnSe/CdZnS/ZnS core/shell nanorods. The gradient alloyed CdZnSe/CdZnS shell effectively suppresses the electron delocalization and reduces hole injection barrier compared with conventional CdS shell. Therefore, the NRs exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and a high degree of linear polarization. The NR&#8208;LEDs show record external quantum efficiency, high brightness, and high current efficiency simultaneously.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on isotropic quantum dots has approached the theoretical limit of close to 20%. Anisotropic nanorods can break this limit by taking advantage of their directional emission. However, the progress towards higher EQE by using CdSe/CdS nanorods (NRs) faces several challenges, primarily involving the low quantum yield and unbalanced charge injection in devices. Herein, the seeded growth method is modified and anisotropic nanorods are obtained with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 98% by coating a gradient alloyed CdZnSe shell around conventional spherical CdSe seeds. This intermediate alloyed CdZnSe shell combined with a subsequent rod&#8208;shaped CdZnS/ZnS shell can effectively suppress the electron delocalization in the typical CdSe/CdS nanorods due to their small conduction bandgap offset. Additionally, this alloyed shell can reduce the hole&#8208;injection barrier and create a larger barrier for electron injection, both effects promoting a balanced injection of electrons and holes in LEDs. Hence, LEDs are reached with high brightness (160341&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and high efficiency (EQE = 22%, current efficiency = 23.19&#160;cd A&#8722;1), which are the highest values to date for nanorod LEDs.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Loaded Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Bacteria for Immuno&#8208;Chemo Combo Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During intravesical treatment, Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) facilitates the tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) nanoparticles. Subsequently, the released DOX induces both chemotherapeutic and immunogenic tumor cell death, thereby releasing additional damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns. This synergistic interaction between DOX and BCG contributes to the establishment of antitumor immunity, ultimately achieving a comprehensive intravesical therapy of bladder cancer.








Abstract
Intravesical Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) is a well&#8208;established strategy for managing high&#8208;risk nonmuscle&#8208;invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, over half of patients still experience disease recurrence or progression. Although the combined intravesical instillation of various chemotherapeutic drugs is implemented in clinical trials to enhance the BCG therapy, the outcome is far from satisfying due to severe irritative effects and treatment intolerance at high doses. Therefore, it is adopted the &#8220;biotin&#8211;streptavidin strategy&#8221; to doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles within live BCG bacteria (DOX@BCG) to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence of BCG to the bladder epithelium helps precisely target DOX@BCG to the local tumor cells and simultaneously increases intratumoral transport of therapeutic drugs. DOX@BCG effectively inhibits cancer progression and prolongs the survival of rats/mice with orthotopic bladder cancer owing to synergism between BCG&#8208;immunotherapy, DOX&#8208;chemotherapy, and DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic tumor cell death; furthermore, it exhibits improved tolerance and biosafety, and establishes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the drug&#8208;loaded live BCG bacterial delivery system holds considerable potential for clinical translation in the intravesical treatment of bladder cancer.

         <title>Sensitive Organic Photodetectors With Spectral Response up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m Using a Quinoidal Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quinoidal molecular semiconductor, with a photoelectric response of up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m, is developed. The resulting photodetector affords unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26% and 41% at a wavelength of 1.10&#160;&#181;m under zero bias and a reverse bias, respectively. Moreover, owing to the low trap density, the photodetector demonstrates detectivity exceeding 1012 Jones from 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Detecting short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light has underpinned several emerging technologies. However, the development of highly sensitive organic photodetectors (OPDs) operating in the SWIR region is hindered by their poor external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and high dark currents. Herein, the development of high&#8208;sensitivity SWIR&#8208;OPDs with an efficient photoelectric response extending up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m is reported. These OPDs utilize a new ultralow&#8208;bandgap molecular semiconductor featuring a quinoidal tricyclic electron&#8208;deficient central unit and multiple non&#8208;covalent conformation locks. The SWIR&#8208;OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal&#8208;generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (Dsh*) exceeding 1013 Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 1012 Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR&#8208;OPD.

         <title>Engineered Microchannel Scaffolds with Instructive Niches Reinforce Endogenous Bone Regeneration by Regulating CSF&#8208;1/CSF&#8208;1R Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a hybrid microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is engineered by a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation by regulating the colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1)/colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) pathway of macrophages.








Abstract
Structural and physiological cues provide guidance for the directional migration and spatial organization of endogenous cells. Here, a microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is developed using a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. Thereinto, polydopamine&#8208;coated nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite is employed as a functional inorganic linker to participate in the entanglement and crystallization of chitosan molecules. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis as well as its in vitro and in vivo verification demonstrates that essential colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 (CSF&#8208;1) factor is induced by this scaffold, and effectively bound to the target colony&#8208;stimulating factor&#8208;1 receptor (CSF&#8208;1R) on the macrophage surface to activate the M2 phenotype, achieving substantial endogenous bone regeneration. This strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for engineering inducible bone regenerative biomaterials.

Here, a microchannel scaffold with instructive niches is developed using a circumferential freeze-casting technique with an alkaline salting-out strategy. Thereinto, polydopamine-coated nano-hydroxyapatite is employed as a functional inorganic linker to participate in the entanglement and crystallization of chitosan molecules. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis as well as its in vitro and in vivo verification demonstrates that essential colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) factor is induced by this scaffold, and effectively bound to the target colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) on the macrophage surface to activate the M2 phenotype, achieving substantial endogenous bone regeneration. This strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for engineering inducible bone regenerative biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Dual CO2&#8208; and Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Membranes for Switchable Double Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coated fiber consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings is prepared by two&#8208;step coating. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics, achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various double oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. 








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes demonstrate promising applications in switchable oil/water emulsion separations. However, they are unsuitable for the treatment of double emulsions like oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (O/W/O) and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) emulsions. For efficient separation of these complicated emulsions, fine control over the wettability, response time, and aperture structure of the membrane is required. Herein, dual&#8208;coated fibers consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings are prepared by two steps. Automated weaving of these fibers produces membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics and narrow pore size distributions. These membranes exhibit fast switching wettability between superhydrophilicity (under CO2 stimulation) and high hydrophobicity (under near&#8208;infrared stimulation), achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. Two&#8208;dimensional low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance and correlated spectra technique are used to clarify the underlying mechanism of switchable double emulsion separation. The approach can effectively address the challenges associated with the use of stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes for double emulsion separation and facilitate the industrial application of these membranes.

         <title>Triboelectric Energy Harvesting from Highly Conjugated Fused Aromatic Ladder Structure Under Extreme Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure is developed as a tribo&#8208;positive material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The 3D&#8208;FAL offers high specific surface area and porosity, good physicochemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. As a result, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG demonstrates high performance and stability under harsh operating conditions.








Abstract
Practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been challenging, particularly, under harsh environmental conditions. This work proposes a novel 3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure as a tribo&#8208;positive material for TENGs, to address these challenges. The 3D&#8208;FAL offers a unique materials engineering platform for tailored properties, such as high specific surface area and porosity, good thermal and mechanical stability, and tunable electronic properties. The fabricated 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG reaches a maximum peak power density of 451.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 5 Hz frequency. More importantly, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG maintains stable output performance under harsh operating environments, over wide temperature (&#8722;45&#8211;100&#160;&#176;C) and humidity ranges (8.3&#8211;96.7% RH), representing the development of novel FAL for sustainable energy generation under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG proves to be a promising device for a speed monitoring system engaging reconstruction in virtual reality in a snowy environment.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ionic Hopping Migration and Self&#8208;Healability toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is presented to introduce oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based (OR&#8208;PUU/PAM) hydrogel electrolytes. Benefiting from their high ionic conductivity, desolvation effect, ionic hopping migration, and self&#8208;healability, the resulting Zn symmetric cell exhibits prominent cycling stability. This work provides meaningful guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs), characterized by intrinsic safety, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility, can promote the development of flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). However, current FAZIB technology is severely restricted by the uncontrollable dendrite growth arising from undesirable reactions between the HEs with sluggish ionic conductivity and Zn metal. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a molecular engineering strategy, which involves the introduction of oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based HEs. The OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs facilitate rapid ion transfer through their ionic hopping migration mechanism, resulting in uniform and orderly Zn2+ deposition. The abundant polar groups on the OR&#8208;PUU molecules in OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs break the inherent H&#8208;bond network, tune the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. Moreover, the interaction of hierarchical H&#8208;bonds in the OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs endows them with self&#8208;healability, enabling in situ repair of cracks induced by plating/stripping. Consequently, Zn symmetric cells incorporating the novel OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs exhibit a long cycling life of 2000&#160;h. The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Sprayed Bioinspired Adhesive Conductive Hydrogels for Cavernous Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a bioinspired nucleobase adhesion strategy is proposed to design an adhesive conductive hydrogel spray with immunomodulatory, and endoscopic delivery convenience for cavernous nerve repair. The feasibility and validity of sprayable hydrogel in minimally invasive surgery is verified through the use of a beagle model. The results reveal the great potential of sprayable conductive hydrogel materials as next&#8208;generation minimally invasive nerve repair materials.








Abstract
Cavernous nerve injury (CNI), resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED), poses a significant threat to the quality of life for men. Strategies utilizing conductive hydrogels have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerves with a large diameter (&gt;2&#160;mm). However, integrating convenient minimally invasive operation, antiswelling and immunomodulatory conductive hydrogels for treating small&#8208;diameter injured cavernous nerves remains a great challenge. Here, a sprayable adhesive conductive hydrogel (GACM) composed of gelatin, adenine, carbon nanotubes, and mesaconate designed for cavernous nerve repair is developed. Multiple hydrogen bonds provide GACM with excellent adhesive and antiswelling properties, enabling it to establish a conformal electrical bridge with the damaged nerve and aiding in the regeneration process. Additionally, mesaconate&#8208;loaded GACM suppresses the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages and promotes the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells. In vivo tests demonstrate that the GACM hydrogel repairs the cavernous nerve and restores erectile function and fertility. Furthermore, the feasibility of sprayable GACM in minimally invasive robotic surgery in beagles is validated. Given the benefits of therapeutic effectiveness and clinical convenience, the research suggests a promising future for sprayable GACM materials as advanced solutions for minimally invasive nerve repair.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional pore structures of polyolefin separators have a significant influence on the ion flux distribution towards the lithium (Li) electrode, which consequently causes different Li deposition behavior. It is revealed that an appropriate separator creates a more homogeneous Li ion flux, a more compact deposit Li, and enables Li metal batteries to achieve a longer cycle life.








Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional&#160;pores of different polyethylene separators, it is revealed that the pore structure of the separator has a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior, and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It is also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li&#8208;ion toward Li metal electrode is positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of the pore structure of polyolefin separators but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Coexistence of Quantum&#8208;Spin&#8208;Hall and Quantum&#8208;Hall&#8208;Topological&#8208;Insulating States in Graphene/hBN on SrTiO3 Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a monolayer hBN spacer allows the coexistence of quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) states with different symmetries and causes for the helical edge spin phases in the same single graphene placed on an SrTiO3 substrate, with a crossover regime between the two at low magnetic fields.








Abstract
SrTiO3 (STO) substrate, a perovskite oxide material known for its high dielectric constant (&#603;), facilitates the observation of various (high&#8208;temperature) quantum phenomena. A quantum Hall topological insulating (QHTI) state, comprising two copies of QH states with antiparallel two ferromagnetic edge&#8208;spin overlap protected by the U(1) axial rotation symmetry of spin polarization, has recently been achieved in low magnetic field (B) even as high as &#8776;100 K in a monolayer graphene/thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacer placed on an STO substrate, thanks to the high &#603; of STO. Despite the use of the heavy STO substrate, however, proximity&#8208;induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) states in 2D TI phases, featuring a topologically protected helical edge spin phase within time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry, is not confirmed. Here, with the use of a monolayer hBN spacer, it is revealed the coexistence of QSH (at B = 0T) and QHTI (at B &#8800; 0) states in the same single graphene sample placed on an STO, with a crossover regime between the two at low B. It is also classified that the different symmetries of the two nontrivial helical edge spin phases in the two states lead to different interaction with electron&#8208;puddle quantum dots, caused by a local surface pocket of the STO, in the crossover regime, resulting in a spin dephasing only for the QHTI state. The results obtained using STO substrates open the doors to investigations of novel QH spin states with different symmetries and their correlations with quantum phenomena. This exploration holds value for potential applications in spintronic devices.

         <title>Underpotential Deposition of 3D Transition Metals: Versatile Electrosynthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Oxidized Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple, versatile approach for synthesis of oxidized carbon&#8208;supported mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single atom catalysts (SACs) based on underpotential deposition. The authors achieve minute&#8208;scale synthesis of Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs under ambient conditions and showcase the catalytic performance of an as&#8208;synthesized Co SAC for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has become a popular strategy for tuning activity and selectivity toward specific pathways. However, conventional SAC synthesis methods require high temperatures and pressures, complicated procedures, and expensive equipment. Recently, underpotential deposition (UPD) has been investigated as a promising alternative, yielding high&#8208;loading SAC electrodes under ambient conditions and within minutes. Yet only few studies have employed UPD to synthesize SACs, and all have been limited to UPD of Cu. In this work, a flexible UPD approach for synthesis of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs directly on oxidized, commercially available carbon electrodes is reported. The UPD mechanism is investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and, finally, the catalytic performance of a UPD&#8208;synthesized Co SAC is assessed for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. The findings expand upon the usefulness and versatility of UPD for SAC synthesis, with hopes of enabling future research toward realization of fast, reliable, and fully electrified SAC synthesis processes.

         <title>Tailoring Built&#8208;In Electric Field in a Self&#8208;Assembled Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework/MXene Nanocomposites for Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that self&#8208;assembled zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8211;MXene nanocomposites, featuring tunable built&#8208;in electric field, exhibit outstanding microwave absorption performance (reflection loss (RLmin) = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (fE) = 6.32 GHz). This innovative model system provides insights into interfacial polarization mechanisms and introduces a pioneering approach to developing electromagnetic functional materials through spatial charge heterointerface engineering.








Abstract
Heterointerface engineering, which plays a pivotal role in developing advanced microwave&#8208;absorbing materials, is employed to design zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8211;MXene nanocomposites. The ZIF&#8211;MXene composites are prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of negatively charged titanium carbide MXene flakes and positively charged Co&#8208;containing ZIF nanomaterials. This approach effectively creates abundant Mott&#8211;Schottky heterointerfaces exhibiting a robust built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) effect, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical analyses, leading to a notable attenuation of electromagnetic energy. Systematic manipulation of the BIEF&#8208;exhibiting heterointerface, achieved through topological modulation of the ZIF, proficiently alters charge separation, facilitates electron migration, and ultimately enhances polarization relaxation loss, resulting in exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss RLmin = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth fE = 6.32 GHz). The present study demonstrates an innovative model system for elucidating the interfacial polarization mechanisms and pioneers a novel approach to developing functional materials with electromagnetic characteristics through spatial charge engineering.

         <title>Observation of High&#8208;Capacity Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 with Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry as T&#8208;Nb2O5 and similar structure to B&#8208;TiO2 is essentially inert for lithium storage. To address this issue, here implementation of both electron transport and Li+ migration &#8220;superhighways&#8221; by developing defect&#8208;rich and nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x pseudocrystals via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion is proposed. The resulting B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x achieves ultrahigh specific capacity and rate capability, surpassing that of Li4Ti5O12.








Abstract
Apart from Li4Ti5O12, there are few anode substitutes that can be used in commercial high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Orthorhombic T&#8208;Nb2O5 has recently been proven to be another substitute anode. However, monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry is essentially inert for lithium storage, but the underlying reasons are unclear. In order to activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5, herein, nanoporous pseudocrystals to achieve a larger specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8722;1 than Li4Ti5O12 (theoretical capacity: 175 mAh g&#8722;1) are proposed. These pseudocrystals are rationally synthesized via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological microcorrosion process from LiNbO3 precursor. Compared to pristine B&#8208;Nb2O5, experimental investigations reveal that B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers &#8776;3000 times higher electronic conductivity and tenfold enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient. An &#8776;30% reduction of energy barrier for Li&#8208;ion migration is also confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The nanoporous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x delivers unique ion/electron transport channels to proliferate the reversible and deeper lithiation, which activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5. The capacitive&#8208;like behavior is observed to endow B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8722;x ultrafast lithium storage ability, harvesting 136 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C and 72 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 250 C, superior to Li4Ti5O12. Pouch&#8208;type full cells exhibit the energy density of &#8776;251&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and ultrahigh power density up to &#8776;35&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.

         <title>PbS Quantum Dots Ink with Months&#8208;Long Shelf&#8208;Lifetime Enabling Scalable and Efficient Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead iodide is used in phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of&#160;PbS quantum dots of size up to 6.7 nm. These inks show at least ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, confirmed by the absorption spectroscopy and the field&#8208;effect transistor performances. Photodetectors fabricate via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity.








Abstract
The phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of PbS quantum dots (QDs) has substantially simplified device fabrication giving hope for future industrial exploitation. However, this technique when applied to QDs of large size (&gt;4&#160;nm) gives rise to inks with poor colloidal stability, thus hindering the development of QDs photodetectors in short&#8208;wavelength infrared range. Here, it is demonstrated that methylammonium lead iodide ligands can provide sufficient passivation of PbS QDs of size up to 6.7&#160;nm, enabling inks with a minimum of ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, as proven by optical absorption and solution&#8208;small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Furthermore, the maximum linear electron mobility of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 is measured in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated with fresh inks, while transistors fabricated with the same solution after ten&#8208;week storage retain 74% of the average starting electron mobility, demonstrating the outstanding quality both of the fresh and aged inks. Finally, photodetectors fabricated via blade&#8208;coating exhibit 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones specific detectivity, values comparable with devices fabricated using ink with lower stability and wasteful methods such as spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Rapid 3D Printing of Photoresponsive Resins for Optically Clear Multifunctional 3D Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors have developed novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins for photoactive 3D printing. Their mechanistic evaluation of photoinitiating systems enable 3D printing of transparent objects with rapid build speeds and exceptional feature resolution. By incorporating hexaarylbiimidazole derivatives in the resin formulation, spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation is achieved, providing capabilities such as crack healing and selective erasing under violet/blue light irradiation.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven 3D printing is gaining significant attention for its unparalleled build speed and high&#8208;resolution in additive manufacturing. However, extending vat photopolymerization to multifunctional, photoresponsive materials poses challenges, such as light attenuation and interference between the photocatalysts (PCs) and photoactive moieties. This study introduces novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high&#8208;resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine&#8208;based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low&#8208;intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically&#8208;clear 3D printed objects. Real&#8208;time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI&#8208;containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&#8722;1, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self&#8208;healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Hydrogel Films with Tunable Luminescence and Afterglow Behavior for Visual Detection of Ofloxacin and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lanthanide MOF &#8211; carrageenan hydrogel material is prepared and its luminescent sensing properties towards ofloxacin antibiotic in raw meat are demonstrated. Hydrogel films based on bimetallic MOFs demonstrate tunable multicolor luminescence with the afterglow effect suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Highly selective and sensitive quantitative detection of ofloxacin (OFX) at ultralow concentrations in aqueous media and development of new afterglow materials remains a challenge. Herein, a new 2D water&#8208;stable lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb) is proposed, which exhibits high selectivity towards OFX through the luminescence quenching with the lowest detection limit (1.1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;9 M) reported to date and a fast response within 6 s. In addition, the luminescent detection of OFX by NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is not affected by typical components of blood plasma and urine. The excellent sensing effect of NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is further utilized to prepare a composite functional sensing carrageenan hydrogel material for the rapid detection of OFX in meat in real time and the first discovery of impressive afterglow in MOF&#8208;based hydrogels. This study not only presents novel Ln&#8208;MOF materials and Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color&#8208;tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

This study not only presents novel Ln-MOF materials and Ln-MOF-based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color-tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti-counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted Macrophage CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 mRNA Editing in Immunotherapy for Tendon Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional delivery methods of CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. This work furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase, triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently to alleviate inflammation.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 holds substantial promise for tissue repair through its RNA editing capabilities and swift catabolism. However, conventional delivery methods fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. In this investigation, macrophage&#8208;targeting cationic polymers are systematically screened to facilitate the entry of Cas13 ribonucleic&#8208;protein complex (Cas13 RNP) into macrophages. Notably, SPP1 (OPN encoding)&#8208;producing macrophages are recognized as a profibrotic subtype that emerges during the inflammatory stage. By employing ROS&#8208;responsive release mechanisms tailored for macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP editing systems, the overactivation of SPP1 is curbed in the face of an acute immune microenvironment. Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtails the emergence of injury&#8208;induced SPP1&#8208;producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, this study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.

         <title>A Spiking Artificial Vision Architecture Based on Fully Emulating the Human Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiking&#8208;based artificial vision architecture consisting of event&#8208;based spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses is reported. The spiking photodetectors directly convert light into electrical spiking signals for artificial synapse&#8208;based neuromorphic computing. And the event&#8208;triggered mechanism greatly reduces the total power consumption. This fully emulated human vision architecture will effectively improve the performance of artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Intelligent vision necessitates the deployment of detectors that are always&#8208;on and low&#8208;power, mirroring the continuous and uninterrupted responsiveness characteristic of human vision. Nonetheless, contemporary artificial vision systems attain this goal by the continuous processing of massive image frames and executing intricate algorithms, thereby expending substantial computational power and energy. In contrast, biological data processing, based on event&#8208;triggered spiking, has higher efficiency and lower energy consumption. Here, this work proposes an artificial vision architecture consisting of spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses, closely mirroring the intricacies of the human visual system. Distinct from previously reported techniques, the photodetector is self&#8208;powered and event&#8208;triggered, outputting light&#8208;modulated spiking signals directly, thereby fulfilling the imperative for always&#8208;on with low&#8208;power consumption. With the spiking signals processing through the integrated synapse units, recognition of graphics, gestures, and human action has been implemented, illustrating the potent image processing capabilities inherent within this architecture. The results prove the 90% accuracy rate in human action recognition within a mere five epochs utilizing a rudimentary artificial neural network. This novel architecture, grounded in spiking photodetectors, offers a viable alternative to the extant models of always&#8208;on low&#8208;power artificial vision system.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Schottky Junction Treats Atherosclerosis by a Biomimetic Trojan Horse Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a rod&#8208;like gold&#8208;zinc oxide (Au&#8208;ZnO) Schottky junction for enhanced piezocatalytic performance and camouflage with the macrophage membrane for improved biocompatibility and intraplaque enrichment. The obtained biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM promotes foamy macrophage apoptosis as well as cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis activated by apoptotic fragments, fulfilling amplified piezocatalytic atherosclerosis therapy by a biomimetic Trojan horse strategy.








Abstract
The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque is characterized by the&#160;foamy macrophage burden, involving impaired cholesterol efflux and deficient efferocytosis. Correspondingly, piezocatalytic therapy is an emerging solution for eliminating the foamy macrophage burden with satisfactory spatiotemporal controllability and deep penetration depth. Herein, a biomimetic Trojan horse (Au&#8208;ZnO@MM) is engineered by coating the macrophage membrane (MM) onto the surface of a rod&#8208;like Au&#8208;ZnO Schottky Junction to effectively relieve the atherosclerotic progression. These Trojan horses with the coating of MM are actively transported into subsistent foamy macrophages and generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalysis. ROS&#8208;initiated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction induce substantial cell apoptosis, alleviating the burden of subsistent foamy macrophages. The resulting apoptotic fragments further significantly facilitate cholesterol excretion and trigger efferocytosis of intraplaque fresh macrophages. Ultimately, the biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM piezocatalyst not only inhibits the foaming capacity of macrophages, but also improves the function of removing cell debris, which can stabilize atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Meanwhile, the plasmon resonance effect of integrated gold nanoparticles enables favorable photoacoustic molecular imaging for real&#8208;time image&#8208;guided atherosclerotic therapy. This proposed biomimetic Trojan horse strategy provides the paradigm of employing ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalytic methodology for enhanced atherosclerotic theranostics.

         <title>4D Multimaterial Printing of Soft Actuators with Spatial and Temporal Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the double&#8208;layer printed circuit board structure, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator that integrates a hydrophilic pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel and a hydrophobic shape&#8208;memory polymer with an adhesive layer to overcome poor interface compatibility, is designed. This integration enables active spatiotemporal control of actuation, while 4D printing facilitates a diverse range of configurations. 








Abstract
Soft actuators (SAs) are devices which can interact with delicate objects in a manner not achievable with traditional robotics. While it is possible to design a SA whose actuation is triggered via an external stimulus, the use of a single stimulus creates challenges in the spatial and temporal control of the actuation. Herein, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator design (MMSA) whose actuation is only initiated by a combination of triggers (i.e., pH and temperature) is presented. Using 3D printing, a multilayered soft actuator with a hydrophilic pH&#8208;sensitive layer, and a hydrophobic magnetic and temperature&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer layer, is designed. The hydrogel responds to environmental pH conditions by swelling or shrinking, while the shape&#8208;memory polymer can resist the shape deformation of the hydrogel until triggered by temperature or light. The combination of these stimuli&#8208;responsive layers allows for a high level of spatiotemporal control of the actuation. The utility of the 4D MMSA is demonstrated via a series of cargo capture and release experiments, validating its ability to demonstrate active spatiotemporal control. The MMSA concept provides a promising research direction to develop multifunctional soft devices with potential applications in biomedical engineering and environmental engineering.

         <title>Isomerization of Benzothiadiazole Yields a Promising Polymer Donor and Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.0%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole to 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) in polymers can concurrently improve photon harvest, suppress nonradiative energy loss, and increase charge mobility. Consequently, the organic solar cells (OSCs) made with polymer PiBT donor and Y6 acceptor achieve efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Polymer PiBT does broaden the family of efficient polymer donors.

The exploration of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors remains critical to achieve high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) beyond current thresholds. Herein, the 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT), which is an isomer of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT), is used to design wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor PiBT. The PiBT&#8208;based solar cells reach efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Systemic studies show that isomerization of BT to iBT can finely regulate the polymers&#8217; photoelectric properties including i) increasing the extinction coefficient and photon harvest, ii) downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels, iii) improving the coplanarity of polymer backbones, iv) offering good thermodynamic miscibility with acceptors. Consequently, the PiBT:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device simultaneously reaches advantageous nanoscale morphology, efficient exciton generation and dissociation, fast charge transportation, and suppressed charge recombination, leading to larger VOC of 0.87&#160;V, higher JSC of 28.2 mA cm&#8722;2, greater fill factor of 77.3%, and thus higher efficiency of 19.0%, while the analog&#8208;PBT&#8208;based OSCs reach efficiency of only 12.9%. Moreover, the key intermediate iBT can be easily afforded from industry chemicals via two&#8208;step procedure. Overall, this contribution highlights that iBT is a promising motif for designing high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

&lt;p&gt;Isomerization of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole to 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole (iBT) in polymers can concurrently improve photon harvest, suppress nonradiative energy loss, and increase charge mobility. Consequently, the organic solar cells (OSCs) made with polymer PiBT donor and Y6 acceptor achieve efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Polymer PiBT does broaden the family of efficient polymer donors.

         <dc:description>
Deeply understanding the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins based on artificial ion transport systems remains challenging. In this study, a molecular motor&#8208;derived photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel resembling a multi&#8208;core processor is developed. The channel can step&#8208;wise control ion transport and anticancer treatments via executing logic gate instructions. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis.








Abstract
Developing artificial ion transport systems, which process complicated information and step&#8208;wise regulate properties, is essential for deeply comprehending the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins (NCPs). Here a photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel based on single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers containing molecular motors, exhibiting multi&#8208;core processor&#8208;like properties to step&#8208;wise control ion transport is reported. Designed with oxygen, deoxygenation, and different wavelengths of light as input signals, complicated logical circuits comprising &#8220;YES&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221; and &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate components are established. Implementing these logical circuits with K+ transport efficiencies as output signals, multiple state transitions including &#8220;ON&#8221;, &#8220;Partially OFF&#8221; and &#8220;Totally OFF&#8221; in liposomes and cancer cells are realized, further causing step&#8208;wise anticancer treatments. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state (decrease by 50% within 7&#160;min) significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis. This integrated logic&#8208;gated strategy will be expanded toward understanding the delicate mechanism underlying NCPs and treating cancer or other diseases is expected.

         <title>A Nanoscale Trans&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly with a Distinct Anticancer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly Pt&#8211;tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP)&#8211;benzoic acid (BA) is synthesized. In presence of H2O2, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA undergoes decomposition and generates bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species, which can induce unconventional interstrand cross&#8208;links and groove binding with DNA, respectively. These different mechanisms of action from cisplatin make Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA kill Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells efficiently.








Abstract
Drug resistance significantly hampers the clinical application of existing platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs. New platinum medications that possess distinct mechanisms of action are highly desired for the treatment of Pt&#8208;resistant cancers. Herein, a nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly (Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA) is prepared via using trans&#8208;[PtCl2(pyridine)(NH3)] (transpyroplatin), tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP), and benzoic acid (BA) as building blocks to combat drug resistance in platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies indicate that Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA shows a hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;responsive dissociation behavior along with the generation of bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species. Different from cisplatin, these degradation products interact with DNA via interstrand cross&#8208;links and small groove binding, and induce significant upregulation of cell&#8208;death&#8208;related proteins such as p53, cleaved caspase 3, p21, and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. As a result, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA exhibits potent killing effects against Pt&#8208;resistant tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work not only provides a new platinum drug for combating drug&#8208;resistant cancer but also offers a new paradigm for the development of platinum&#8208;based supramolecular anticancer drugs.

         <title>Regenerated Graphite Electrodes with Reconstructed Solid Electrolyte Interface and Enclosed Active Lithium Toward &gt;100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ and fast solid electrolyte interface (SEI) engineering strategy (&lt;1 s) is proposed to efficiently convert degraded graphite into an air&#8208;stable, prelithiated, and regenerated material via reconstructing the original SEI and utilizing the residual active lithium, featuring significant environmental and economic advantages. This innovative approach holds the potential to efficiently propel the development of high&#8208;performance anodes.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is arguably the most important concern in graphite anodes, which determines their achievable Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. In spent graphite anodes, there are already&#8208;formed (yet loose and/or broken) SEIs and some residual active lithium, which, if can be inherited in the regenerated electrodes, are highly desired to compensate for the lithium loss due to SEI formation. However, current graphite regenerated approaches easily destroy the thin SEIs and residue active lithium, making their reuse impossible. Herein, this work reports a fast&#8208;heating strategy (e.g., 1900 K for &#8776;150&#160;ms) to upcycle degraded graphite via instantly converting the loose original SEI layer (&#8776;100&#160;nm thick) to a compact and mostly inorganic one (&#8776;10&#8211;30&#160;nm thick with a 26X higher Young's Modulus) and still retaining the activity of residual lithium. Thanks to the robust SEI and enclosed active lithium, the regenerated graphite exhibited 104.7% initial CE for half&#8208;cell and gifted the full cells with LiFePO4 significantly improved initial CE (98.8%&#160;versus 83.2%) and energy density (309.4&#160;versus 281.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), as compared with commercial graphite. The as&#8208;proposed upcycling strategy turns the &#8220;waste&#8221; graphite into high&#8208;value prelithiated ones, along with significant economic and environmental benefits.

         <title>Intergrating Hollow Multishelled Structure and High Entropy Engineering toward Enhanced Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Properties in Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high entropy oxide (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 hollow multishelled sphere (HEO&#8208;HoMS) with multiple electroactive elements is successfully developed. Benefiting from the delicate cocontrol from molecule to microstructure, HEO&#8208;HoMS provides impressively high specific capacity and long life span for lithium storage. This work may inspire more thoughts on rational multiscale design of conversion&#8208;type electrodes.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) are attracting great interest in lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the conversion anodes, owing to their superior buffering effect and mechanical stability. Given the synthetic challenges, especially elemental diffusion barrier in the multimetal combinations, this complex structure design has been realized in low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy compounds so far. It means that poor reaction reversibility and low intrinsic conductivity remain largely unresolved. Here, a hollow multishelled (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 high entropy oxide (HEO) is developed through integrating molecule and microstructure engineering. As expected, the HoMS design exhibits significant targeting functionality, yielding satisfactory structure and cycling stability. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen defects and optimized electronic structure of HEO accelerate the lithiation kinetics, while the retention of the parent lattice matrix enables reversible lithium storage, which is validated by rigorous in situ tests and theoretical simulations. Benefiting from these combined properties, such hollow multishelled HEO anode can deliver a specific capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 (89% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The synergistic lattice and volume stability showcased in this work holds great promise in guiding the material innovations for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Epigenetically Relieving the MYC&#8208;Correlated Immunosuppression via an Advanced Nano&#8208;Radiosensitizer Potentiates Cancer Immuno&#8208;Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy causes patients severe MYC&#8208;mediated immune tolerance. To address this clinical issue, a high&#8208;Z metal&#8211;phenolic nanoradiosensitizer is engineered to dual&#8208;epigenetically downregulate MYC expression and trigger cancer cellular IFN&#8208;I signaling. This tactic significantly enhances the proliferation, intratumoral infiltration, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells but decreases the levels of immune suppressors.








Abstract
Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy&#8208;triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC&#8208;transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, 5&#8208;Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF&#8208;2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) are engineered into a tungsten&#8208;based nano&#8208;radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5&#8208;Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF&#8208;2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) signaling. Coupling 5&#8208;Aza with ITF&#8208;2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC&#8208;related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN&#8208;I signal&#8208;related proteins involving IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI&#8208;triggered immuno&#8208;radiotherapy remarkably enhances antitumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory&#8208;phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy&#8208;induced MYC overexpression via the dual&#8208;epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno&#8208;radiotherapy.

         <title>A Hybrid Pulsed Laser Deposition Approach to Grow Thin Films of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials is challenging due to differences in the reactivity, and surface adatom sticking and mobility. A novel approach &#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor delivery is combined with pulsed laser deposition is used to grow several sulfides as epitaxial or textured thin films with superior crystallinity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. 








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity, sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, a novel approach is reported to grow chalcogenides&#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides, transition metal chalcogenides, and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated, and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity, and surface and interface roughness compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The growth method can be broadened to other vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched chalcogenides such as selenides and tellurides. This work opens up opportunities for broader epitaxial growth of chalcogenides, especially sulfide&#8208;based thin film technological applications.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Encryption Fueled via Tunable Mechanical Composite Micrograting Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dynamic optical encryption strategy using tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By generating dynamic keys with large space capacity for encrypted diffraction patterns, MCWGES effectively prevents eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in information security.








Abstract
Optical grating devices based on micro/nanostructured functional surfaces are widely employed to precisely manipulate light propagation, which is significant for information technologies, optical data storage, and light sensors. However, the parameters of rigid periodic structures are difficult to tune after manufacturing, which seriously limits their capacity for in situ light manipulation. Here, a novel anti&#8208;eavesdropping, anti&#8208;damage, and anti&#8208;tamper dynamic optical encryption strategy are reported via tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By mechanically composing multiple in&#8208;situ tunable ordered wrinkle gratings, the dynamic keys with large space capacity are generated to obtain encrypted diffraction patterns, which can provide a higher level of security for the encrypted systems. Furthermore, a multiple grating cone diffraction model is proposed to reveal the dynamic optical encryption principle of MCWGES. Optical encryption communication using dynamic keys has the effect of preventing eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. This dynamic encryption method based on optical manipulation of wrinkle grating demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in the field of information security.

         <title>Stretchable Device for Simultaneous Measurements of Contractility and Electrophysiology of Neuromuscular Tissue in the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable electrode made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is demonstrated for simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses in dynamic neuromuscular gastrointestinal tissues. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional lithography.








Abstract
Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone FS&#8208;30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean&#8208;room&#8208;based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#181;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.

The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution-processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional lithography.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone FS-30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution-processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean-room-based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#181;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene and MOF Assembly: Enhanced Fabrication and Functional Derivative via MOF Amorphization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of graphene&#8208;MOFs (MOFs, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) carries substantial implications across diverse domains. This work provides an efficient fabrication of graphene&#8208;MOFs assembly, uncovers critical mechanisms underlying the assembly efficiency, and showcases the assembly's versatility in electrocatalysis through MOF amorphization. By doing so, it is aimed to open up new avenues for graphene&#8208;MOFs in advancing the field of electrocatalysis and beyond.








Abstract
The integration of graphene and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has numerous implications across various domains, but fabricating such assemblies is often complicated and time&#8208;consuming. Herein, a one&#8208;step preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF assembly is presented by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF&#8208;7, ZIF&#8208;8, and ZIF&#8208;67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high&#8208;efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. The versatility of VG&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67 assembly is further demonstrated&#160;by exploring the process of MOF amorphization. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin&#8208;film coating formed on VG (named VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67), which preserves the short&#8208;range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF&#8208;67 while sacrificing the long&#8208;range order. Such a unique film&#8208;on&#8208;graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF&#8208;67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well&#8208;suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H2O2 in acid media.

         <title>Carboxylating Elastomer via Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Reaction to Improve Miscibility with Conjugated Polymers for Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to enhance the miscibility between the conjugated polymer PM6 and the insulating elastomer styrene&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene (SBS) has been developed by incorporating carboxyl groups into SBS (SBS&#8208;COOH), resulting in optimized mechanical properties and morphology of PM6. A remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is achieved for organic solar cells with 5% SBS&#8208;COOH (PM6:L8&#8208;BO system), outperforming devices of PM6:L8&#8208;BO without or with SBS.








Abstract
Incorporating flexible insulating polymers is a straightforward strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of rigid conjugated polymers, enabling their use in flexible electronic devices. However, maintaining electronic characteristics simultaneously is challenging due to the poor miscibility between insulating polymers and conjugated polymers. This study introduces the carboxylation of insulating polymers as an effective strategy to enhance miscibility with conjugated polymers via surface energy modulation and hydrogen bonding. The carboxylated elastomer, synthesized via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, closely matches the surface energy of the conjugated polymer. This significantly improves the mechanical properties, achieving a high crack&#8208;onset strain of 21.48%, surpassing that (5.93%) of the unmodified elastomer:conjugated polymer blend. Upon incorporating the carboxylated elastomer into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based organic solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is attained, which top&#8208;performs among insulating polymer&#8208;incorporated devices and outperforms devices with unmodified elastomer or neat PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The superior efficiency is attributed to the optimized microstructures and enhanced crystallinity for efficient and balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, flexible devices with 5% carboxylated elastomer exhibit superior mechanical stability, retaining &#8776;88.9% of the initial efficiency after 40&#160;000 bending cycles at a 1&#160;mm radius, surpassing &#8776;83.5% for devices with 5% unmodified elastomer.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy Enables Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability</title>

This work proposes a facile three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy by fusing the advantages of ternary blend system and single&#8208;component system for stable and efficient orgainic solar cells. The PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;10&#8208;based three&#8208;in&#8208;one single&#8208;component device not only obtains a breakthrough efficiency of 14.89%, but also displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT), including the photostability, storage stability, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multicomponent blend organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multicomponent OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three&#8208;component and single&#8208;component devices, this work reports an innovative three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single&#8208;component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize, and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three&#8208;in&#8208;one system, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT). These results demonstrate that the three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is facile and promising for developing SCOSCs with superior efficiency and stability.

         <title>External Field&#8208;Responsive Ternary Non&#8208;Noble Metal Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of photothermal assistance principle presents significant opportunities for exploring the relationship between the photothermal effect of catalyst and their as&#8208;tuned comprehensive zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) properties at both normal and extreme working conditions (e.g., low temperature and deformation), and bridging the long&#8208;existing gap between the underlying mechanism of photothermal effect and advanced light&#8208;heat&#8208;electric&#8208;chemical energy conversion.








Abstract
Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field&#8208;responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 stably dispersed on N&#8208;doped Ketjenblack (Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/N&#8208;KB) is developed via polymer&#8208;assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;E is significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possesses comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement is attributed to the photothermal&#8208;heating&#8208;enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant&#8208;molecule motion, active area, and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation.

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of photothermal assistance principle presents significant opportunities for exploring the relationship between the photothermal effect of catalyst and their as-tuned comprehensive zinc-air battery (ZAB) properties at both normal and extreme working conditions (e.g., low temperature and deformation), and bridging the long-existing gap between the underlying mechanism of photothermal effect and advanced light-heat-electric-chemical energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field-responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; stably dispersed on N-doped Ketjenblack (Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N-KB) is developed via polymer-assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; is significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &amp;gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possesses comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement is attributed to the photothermal-heating-enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant-molecule motion, active area, and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation. The findings open vast possibilities toward more-energy-efficient energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Spirobifluorene Phosphonate Based Exciplex Interface Enables Voc Reaching 95% of Theoretical Limit for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exciplex interface is developed by the designed and synthesized spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in perovskite solar cells. The multi&#8208;functional spirobifluorene phosphonate based exciplex interface can promote hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, optimize energy band alignment, and reduce defect&#8208;induced recombination. A record VOC reaching 95% of theoretical limit and a high efficiency are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show significant advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs is limited by interfacial factors such as defect&#8208;induced recombination, energy band mismatch, and non&#8208;intimate interface contact. Here, an exciplex interface is first developed based on the strategically designed and synthesized two spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in PSCs. The exciplex interface constructed by the intimate contact between the multi&#8208;functional molecules and hole transport layer takes the roles to promote the hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, passivate coordination&#8208;unsaturated Pb2+ defects by equipped phosphonate groups, and optimize the energy level alignment. As a result, a record VOC of 1.26&#160;V with a perovskite bandgap of 1.61&#160;eV is achieved, representing over 95% of theoretical limit. This advancement leads to an increase in PCE from 21.29% to 24.12% and improved stability. The exciplex interface paves the way for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of VOC loss and promotes the wider application of PSCs.

         <title>A Fluoride&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like electrolyte is presented to enhance the overall performance of rechargeable Li&#8211;metal batteries. The triflate groups in its channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase that effectively stabilizes Li metal anodes. Besides, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport.








Abstract
To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, a fluoride&#8208;rich solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid&#8208;state and liquid electrolytes is presented. Its unique triflate&#8208;group&#8208;enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport, enabling a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and support a high critical current up to 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over 1 year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high&#8208;voltage cylindrical cells and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.

         <title>Catalytic Nanodots&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis Suppression in Nucleus Pulposus for Antioxidant Intervention of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the primary instigators of pyroptosis and lack pharmacological intervention, advanced carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) are developed as ROS&#8208;scavenging biomaterials to efficiently suppress pyroptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and maintain NP tissue homeostasis for potential intervention in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).








Abstract
Low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent global concern; however, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analyses revealed the critical involvement of pyroptosis in IVDD. Considering the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary instigator of pyroptosis and the lack of an efficient intervention approach, this study developed carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) as ROS&#8208;scavenging catalytic biomaterials to suppress pyroptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells to efficiently alleviate IVDD. Catalytic MCDs have superior efficacy in scavenging intracellular ROS and rescuing homeostasis in the NP microenvironment compared with N&#8208;acetylcysteine, a classical antioxidant. The data validates that pyroptosis plays a vital role in mediating the protective effects of catalytic MCDs against oxidative stress. Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture&#8208;induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.

Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture-induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Endcapping of Hyperbranched Polymers toward Intrinsically Stretchable Semiconductors with Good Ductility and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; hyperbranched strategy is proposed for the development of intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymers. This approach hinders the formation of a homogeneous backbone and promotes the formation of small crystalline domains. The topology network establishes through endcapping branching not only enhances isotropic charge transport but also ensures tensile resistance. This strategy presents a promising approach for designing advanced intrinsically stretchable semiconductors.








Abstract
The advancement of semiconducting polymers stands as a pivotal milestone in the quest to realize wearable electronics. Nonetheless, endowing semiconductor polymers with stretchability without compromising their carrier mobility remains a formidable challenge. This study proposes a &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy for synthesizing hyperbranched semiconducting polymers (HBSPs), aiming to achieve the balance between carrier mobility and stretchability for organic electronics. The findings unveil that the aggregates formed by the endcapped hyperbranched network structure not only ensure efficient charge transport but also demonstrate superior tensile resistance. In comparison to linear conjugated polymers, HBSPs exhibit substantially larger crack onset strains and notably diminished tensile moduli. It is evident that the HBSPs surpass their linear counterparts in terms of both their semiconducting and mechanical properties. Among HBSPs, HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 stands out as the preeminent candidate within the field of inherently stretchable semiconducting polymers, maintaining 93% of its initial mobility even when subjected to 100% strain (1.41&#160;&#177;&#160;0.206&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, thin film devices of HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 remain stable after undergoing repeated stretching and releasing cycles. Notably, the mobilities are independent of the stretching directions, showing isotropic charge transport behavior. The preliminary study makes this &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy a potential candidate for the future design of organic materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Achieving Stable Lithium Anodes through Leveraging Inevitable Stress Variations via Adaptive Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical failures stemming from substantial volume fluctuations and stress concentration pose formidable challenges for lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To address this, the piezoelectric effect to transform these stresses into robust, responsive, and highly sensitive built&#8208;in electric fields is introduced. This work provides crucial insights in managing mechanical failures, and significantly contributes to characterizing and visualizing latent issues in lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Unleashing the potential of lithium&#8208;metal anodes in practical applications is hindered by the inherent stress&#8208;related challenges arising from their limitless volume expansion, leading to mechanical failures such as electrode cracking, solid electrolyte interphase damage, and dendritic growth.&#160;Despite the various protective strategies to &#8220;combat&#8221; stress in lithium&#8208;metal anodes, they fail to address the intrinsic issue fundamentally. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that leverages the stress generated during the battery cycling via the piezoelectric effect, transforming to the adaptive built&#8208;in electric field to accelerate lithium&#8208;ion migration, homogenize the lithium deposition, and alleviate the stress concentration. The mechanism of the piezoelectric effect in modulating electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution is further validated and decoupled through finite element method simulations. Inspired by this strategy, a high sensitivity, fast responsive, and strength adaptability polymer piezoelectric is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the corresponding protected lithium&#8208;metal anode shows cycling stability over 6000&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and extending life in a variety of coin and pouch cell systems. This work effectively tackles the stress&#8208;related issues and decoupling the electro&#8208;chemomechanical field evolution also contributes to developing more stable lithium anodes for future research.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Tellurium Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is demonstrated for aqueous zinc batteries with a highly concentrated ZnCl2 electrolyte, achieving a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. The reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion is disclosed with TeCl4 as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are potential candidates for sustainable energy storage systems at a grid scale, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the existing cathode chemistries exhibit restricted energy density, which hinders their extensive applications. Here, a tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is presented for aqueous zinc batteries, which delivers a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. A highly concentrated electrolyte (30&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 ZnCl2) is revealed crucial for initiating the Te redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion as it suppresses the H2O reactivity and inhibits undesirable hydrolysis of the Te4+ product. By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion with TeCl4 is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion&#8208;type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox&#8208;amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>HLCT&#8208;Type Acceptor Molecule&#8208;Based Exciplex System for Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processable OLEDs with Suppressed Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two HLCT emitters are synthesized as acceptor molecules in the exciplex system. By using the exciplex system as an emitter, a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diode achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using the exciplex as a host matrix for phosphors.








Abstract
Exciplex systems are promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules because of the small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST). However, realizing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency (EQE) roll&#8208;off in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using an exciplex system remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two (HLCT)&#8208;type isomers with a spiro skeleton, 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ, are designed and synthesized as acceptors of exciplexes, where tert&#8208;butylspirofluorene indole is regarded as a donor and the triazine unit as an acceptor. Green exciplex emissions are observed for the 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC exciplexes, indicating distinct TADF characteristics with a very small &#916;EST of 35 &#177; 5 meV. By using the TADF exciplex system based on the HLCT acceptor as an emitter, solution&#8208;processable OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off (&#8776;3.5% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2) is obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using HLCT&#8208;based exciplexes as the host matrix of phosphors. This study paves the way for a novel strategy for designing acceptor exciplex molecules for effective TADF molecules and host matrices in solution&#8208;processable OLEDs.

   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;i&gt;spo&lt;/i&gt;Cz-TRZ, are designed and synthesized as acceptors of exciplexes, where &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylspirofluorene indole is regarded as a donor and the triazine unit as an acceptor. Green exciplex emissions are observed for the 2-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;i&gt;spo&lt;/i&gt;Cz-TRZ:TAPC and 10-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;i&gt;spo&lt;/i&gt;Cz-TRZ:TAPC exciplexes, indicating distinct TADF characteristics with a very small &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; of 35 &#177; 5 meV. By using the TADF exciplex system based on the HLCT acceptor as an emitter, solution-processable OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 25% with a very low-efficiency roll-off (&#8776;3.5% at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is obtained for solution-processable phosphorescent devices using HLCT-based exciplexes as the host matrix of phosphors. This study paves the way for a novel strategy for designing acceptor exciplex molecules for effective TADF molecules and host matrices in solution-processable OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Establishing Pinhole Deposition Mode of Zn via Scalable Monolayer Graphene Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing the specific role of graphene layer for Zn deposition is realized by high&#8208;quality graphene transfer, showcasing that the low lattice mismatch is barely a decisive factor for ideal epitaxial deposition and that the monolayer transferred graphene creates a unique pinhole deposition pattern, which harvests satisfactory battery lifespan






.

Abstract
The uneven texture evolution of Zn during electrodeposition would adversely impact upon the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. To address this issue, tremendous endeavors are made to induce Zn(002) orientational deposition employing graphene and its derivatives. Nevertheless, the effect of prototype graphene film over Zn deposition behavior has garnered less attention. Here, it is attempted to solve such a puzzle via utilizing transferred high&#8208;quality graphene film with controllable layer numbers in a scalable manner on a Zn foil. The multilayer graphene fails to facilitate a Zn epitaxial deposition, whereas the monolayer film with slight breakages steers a unique pinhole deposition mode. In&#8208;depth electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations discover that the transferred graphene film not only acts as an armor to inhibit side reactions but also serves as a buffer layer to homogenize initial Zn nucleation and decrease Zn migration barrier, accordingly enabling a smooth deposition layer with closely stacked polycrystalline domains. As a result, both assembled symmetric and full cells manage to deliver satisfactory electrochemical performances. This study proposes a concept of &#8220;pinhole deposition&#8221; to dictate Zn electrodeposition and broadens the horizons of graphene&#8208;modified Zn anodes.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Graphene Additive&#8208;Free Inks for 3D Printing Customizable Monolithic Integrated Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective, additive&#8208;free, highly robust, and environmentally friendly graphene ink is demonstrated for large&#8208;scale 3D printed MSCs, showing extremely high areal and volumetric energy density, high temperature stability, and good integration. This work provides a great reference value for the commercialization of graphene in the field of 3D printing.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technology with enhanced fidelity can achieve multiple functionalities and boost electrochemical performance of customizable planar micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs), however, precise structural control of additive&#8208;free graphene&#8208;based macro&#8208;assembly electrode for monolithic integrated MSCs (MIMSCs) remains challenging. Here, the large&#8208;scale 3D printing fabrication of customizable planar MIMSCs is reported utilizing additive&#8208;free, high&#8208;quality electrochemically exfoliated graphene inks, which is not required the conventional cryogenic assistance during the printing process and any post&#8208;processing reduction. The resulting MSCs reveal an extremely small engineering footprint of 0.025&#160;cm2, exceptionally high areal capacitance of 4900&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, volumetric capacitance of 195.6&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3, areal energy density of 2.1&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and unprecedented volumetric energy density of 23&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 for a single cell, surpassing most previously reported 3D printed MSCs. The 3D printed MIMSC pack is further demonstrated, with the maximum areal cell count density of 16&#160;cell&#160;cm&#8722;2, the highest output voltage of 192.5&#160;V and the largest output voltage per unit area of 56&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;2 up to date are achieved. This work presents an innovative solution for processing high&#8208;performance additive&#8208;free graphene ink and realizing the large&#8208;scale production of 3D printed MIMSCs for planar energy storage.

         <title>Synergy of Dendrites&#8208;Impeded Atomic Clusters Dissociation and Side Reactions Suppressed Inert Interface Protection for Ultrastable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional composite interphase of Bi/Bi2O3 is in situ designed on Zn anode, for the first time initiating a synergistic modulation mechanism: the innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism inhibiting dendrites formation and chemically inert interface protection mechanism alleviating interfacial side reactions. Eventually, Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 electrode exhibits remarkably prominent cyclic performance both in symmetry cells system and practical full cells system.








Abstract
The sluggish ions&#8208;transfer and inhomogeneous ions&#8208;nucleation induce the formation of randomly oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8211;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, this report in situ designs a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi2O3, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 symmetry cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, DODZn: 60%). Furthermore, under a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C: 45&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1) and negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio (N/P: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 full&#8208;cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled&#8208;up Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable&#8208;energy storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sought in medical scarcity situations, the hydrogel system offers rapid gelation and in situ spraying for treating extensive tissue injuries. Designed to address hemostasis, barrier establishment, and therapeutic treatment, the hydrogel forms in &lt;0.5 s, maintaining a balance between fluidity and mechanical strength.

Abstract
Rapid&#8208;acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex, and urgent injured tissues, is designed. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5 s under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavors to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid-acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex, and urgent injured tissues, is designed. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5 s under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti-inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavors to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propulsion by Directed Explosive Emulsification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach is introduced to create active droplets through a simple process of inducing symmetry&#8208;breaking oversaturation at the interface assembly. The partially oversaturated interfacial packing structure causes the asymmetrical explosive emulsification behavior and enables the directional movement of the droplet. The process exhibits autonomy, repeatability, and versatility in handling diverse nanoparticle compositions, making it highly promising for self&#8208;propulsion applications.








Abstract
An active droplet system, programmed to repeatedly move autonomously at a specific velocity in a well&#8208;defined direction, is demonstrated. Coulombic energy is stored in oversaturated interfacial assemblies of charged nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants by an applied DC electric field and can be released on demand. Spontaneous emulsification is suppressed by an increase in the stiffness of the oversaturated assemblies. Rapidly removing the field releases the stored energy in an explosive event that propels the droplet, where thousands of charged microdroplets are ballistically ejected from the surface of the parent droplet. The ejection is made directional by a symmetry breaking of the interfacial assembly, and the combined interaction force of the microdroplet plume on one side of the droplet propels the droplet distances tens of times its size, making the droplet active. The propulsion is autonomous, repeatable, and agnostic to the chemical composition of the nanoparticles. The symmetry&#8208;breaking in the nanoparticle assembly controls the microdroplet velocity and direction of propulsion. This mechanism of droplet propulsion will advance soft micro&#8208;robotics, establishes a new type of active matter, and introduces new vehicles for compartmentalized delivery.

         <title>Quantifying Dielectric Material Charge Trapping and De&#8208;Trapping Ability Via Ultra&#8208;Fast Charge Self&#8208;Injection Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>

This work proposes an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on the air breakdown effect and introduces a general standard method to quantify traditional triboelectric materials' charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping effects.








Abstract
Recently, utilizing the air breakdown effect in the charge excitation strategy proves as an efficient charge injection technique to increase the surface charge density of dielectric polymers for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, quantitative characterization of the ability of dielectric polymers to trap reverse charges and the effect on the startup time of secondary self&#8208;charge excitation (SSCE) are essential for extensive applications. Here, an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on a self&#8208;charge excitation strategy is proposed, and a standard method to quantify the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping abilities of 23 traditional tribo&#8208;materials is introduced. Further, the relationship among the distribution of dielectric intrinsic deep, shallow trap states, and transportation of trapped charges is systematically analyzed in this article. It shows that the de&#8208;trapping rate of charges directly determines the reactivation and failure of SSCE. Last, independent of TENG contact efficiency, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 2.67 mC m&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;fast startup time of SSCE are obtained using a 15&#160;&#181;m poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) film, breaking the historical record for material modification. As a standard for material selection, this work quantifies the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping ability of the triboelectric dielectric series and provides insights for understanding the charge transport in dielectrics.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene with Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Driven and Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under broad&#8208;spectrum (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR) excitation, photogenerated electrons in semimetallic bismuthene migrate from the partially electronically occupied intermediate band to the lowest fully unoccupied empty band. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for CO2 adsorption/activation significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4.








Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum (ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared light) (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

         <title>Stabilizing Top Interface by Molecular Locking Strategy with Polydentate Chelating Biomaterials toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>

The molecular locking strategy is proposed to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance. The DDPUD&#8208;modified device achieves an enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 23.17% to 24.47%.








Abstract
The instability of top interface induced by interfacial defects and residual tensile strain hinders the realization of long&#8208;term stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p regular perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, one molecular locking strategy is reported to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Both experimental and theoretical evidence collectively uncover that the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, halide vacancy, and/or I&#9472;Pb antisite defects can be effectively healed and locked by firm chemical anchoring on the surface of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, increased carrier lifetimes, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance, which should be liable for strengthened top interface stability and inhibited interfacial nonradiative recombination. The universality of the molecular locking strategy is certified by employing different perovskite compositions. The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17&#8211;24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD&#8208;modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10% of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65 &#176;C, respectively.

The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17&#8211;24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD-modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10% of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65 &#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gold Recovery
An artistic view of the recovery of gold from E&#8208;waste via a revisited version of The Kiss by Gustav Klimt. Dairy components (used for the adsorbing aerogel) are visible within the clothes of the man, while the woman's clothes are composed by gold ingots. The E&#8208;waste used for extracting gold lays as carpet, at the feet of the two lovers. More details can be found in article number 2310642 by Raffaele Mezzenga and co&#8208;workers.

Twisted Bilayer WS2
In article number 2313638, Xuetao Gan, Xuewen Wang, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an improved CVD setup for the direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality twisted bilayer WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0 to 120&#176; by utilizing tilted SiO2/Si substrates. The strong correlation between the second harmonic generation (SHG) response and the twist angle suggests a tunable SHG performance with twist angles.

3D Printing
In article number 2311917 by Hyun&#8208;Jong Paik, Wonjoo Lee, Min Sang Kwon, Dowon Ahn, and co&#8208;workers, panchromatic photopolymer resins, selectively reacting to two colors of lights, are developed and applied to realize photoactive 3D printing. Longer&#8208;wavelength of light (red light, &#8776;620 nm) irradiation initiates rapid photopolymerization and 3D printing, resulting in remarkable build speed and feature resolution. Incorporating violet/blue&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive moieties (&#8776;405&#8211;450 nm), such as hexaarylbiimidazoles, enable independent spatiotemporal degradation/erasing.

         <title>Multimodal Soft Robotic Actuation and Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are a promising direction to create machines capable of complex motion observed in living creatures. Designing soft actuators that perform a combination of multiple actuation modalities allows them to perform intricate tasks. Then, applying multimodal actuators into soft robotics is conducive toward developing robots with multimodal gaits of locomotion that adapt to various environments for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Diverse and adaptable modes of complex motion observed at different scales in living creatures are challenging to reproduce in robotic systems. Achieving dexterous movement in conventional robots can be difficult due to the many limitations of applying rigid materials. Robots based on soft materials are inherently deformable, compliant, adaptable, and adjustable, making soft robotics conducive to creating machines with complicated actuation and motion gaits. This review examines the mechanisms and modalities of actuation deformation in materials that respond to various stimuli. Then, strategies based on composite materials are considered to build toward actuators that combine multiple actuation modes for sophisticated movements. Examples across literature illustrate the development of soft actuators as free&#8208;moving, entirely soft&#8208;bodied robots with multiple locomotion gaits via careful manipulation of external stimuli. The review further highlights how the application of soft functional materials into robots with rigid components further enhances their locomotive abilities. Finally, taking advantage of the shape&#8208;morphing properties of soft materials, reconfigurable soft robots have shown the capacity for adaptive gaits that enable transition across environments with different locomotive modes for optimal efficiency. Overall, soft materials enable varied multimodal motion in actuators and robots, positioning soft robotics to make real&#8208;world applications for intricate and challenging tasks.

         <title>Sensing, Imaging, and Therapeutic Strategies Endowing by Conjugate Polymers for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced conjugated polymers (CPs) are widely used in biomedical applications due to their excellent light absorption, high fluorescence quantum yield, and stability. This paper presents research advances in CPs for biological detection, imaging, therapeutics, and bio&#8208;electronic device fabrication. Through this review, it is hoped to provide cutting&#8208;edge information for basic research and clinical translation of CPs&#8208;based detection methods and technologies.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real&#8208;time imaging diagnosis, and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are first discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs&#8208;based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically. Finally, recent advancements in utilizing CPs as electroactive materials for bioelectronic devices are also investigated. Moreover, the challenges and outlooks of CPs for precision medicine are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is hoped to highlight the frontier progress of CPs and promote new breakthroughs in fundamental research and clinical transformation.

         <title>Engineering and Targeting Neutrophils for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in engineering neutrophils and their derivatives as drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. Targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) and reinvigorating anti&#8208;tumor immunity provide a broad understanding of the potential application of neutrophils in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation and act as the first line of defense against infections. Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils possess heterogeneous phenotypes and functional plasticity in human health and diseases, including cancer. Neutrophils play multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression, and an N1/N2 paradigm of neutrophils in cancer is proposed, where N1 neutrophils exert anti&#8208;tumor properties while N2 neutrophils display tumor&#8208;supportive and immune&#8208;suppressive functions. Selective activation of beneficial neutrophil population and targeted inhibition or re&#8208;polarization of tumor&#8208;promoting neutrophils has shown an important potential in tumor therapy. In addition, due to the natural inflammation&#8208;responsive and physical barrier&#8208;crossing abilities, neutrophils and their derivatives (membranes and extracellular vesicles (EVs)) are regarded as advanced drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, the recent advances in engineering neutrophils for drug delivery and targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment (TME) are comprehensively presented. This review will provide a broad understanding of the potential of neutrophils in cancer therapy.

Engineered biomaterial scaffolds are becoming more prominent in research laboratories to study drug efficacy for oncological applications in vitro, but do they have a place in pharmaceutical drug screening pipelines? The low efficacy of cancer drugs in phase II/III clinical trials suggests that there are critical mechanisms not properly accounted for in the pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Immune cells associated with the tumor may account for some of these failures given recent successes with cancer immunotherapies; however, there are few representative platforms to study immune cells in the context of cancer as traditional 2D culture is typically monocultures and humanized animal models have a weakened immune composition. Biomaterials that replicate tumor microenvironmental cues may provide a more relevant model with greater in vitro complexity. In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered tissues.

Abstract
Nanocarbons are emerging at the forefront of nanoscience, with diverse carbon nanoforms emerging over the past two decades. Early cancer diagnosis and therapy, driven by advanced chemistry techniques, play a pivotal role in mitigating mortality rates associated with cancer. Nanocarbons, with an attractive combination of well&#8208;defined architectures, biocompatibility, and nanoscale dimension, offer an incredibly versatile platform for cancer imaging and therapy. This paper aims to review the underlying principles regarding the controllable synthesis, fluorescence origins, cellular toxicity, and surface functionalization routes of several classes of nanocarbons: carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and carbon nanohorns. This review also highlights recent breakthroughs regarding the green synthesis of different nanocarbons from renewable sources. It also presents a comprehensive and unified overview of the latest cancer&#8208;related applications of nanocarbons and how they can be designed to interface with biological systems and work as cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools. The commercial status for large&#8208;scale manufacturing of nanocarbons is also presented. Finally, it proposes future research opportunities aimed at engendering modifiable and high&#8208;performance nanocarbons for emerging applications across medical industries. This work is envisioned as a cornerstone to guide interdisciplinary teams in crafting fluorescent nanocarbons with tailored attributes that can revolutionize cancer diagnostics and therapy.

         <title>Improve the Charge Carrier Transporting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the charge carrier transport in two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite solar cells, this review shows the relevant progress from bandgap regulation, phase orientation and distribution, amine molecule selection, and energy level matching from the perspective of 2D perovskite structural properties. Finally, the possible future research directions and methods to achieve efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are rationalized.








Abstract
Conventional 3D organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite materials have shown substantial potential in the field of optoelectronics, enabling the power conversation efficiency of solar cells beyond 26%. A key challenge limiting the further commercial application of 3D perovskite solar cells is their inherent instability over outer oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites is provided, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.

         <title>Topological Analysis and Structural Determination of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 19, May 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of covalent organic frameworks can be seen as periodic nets. First, some basic concepts about periodic nets and topology are introduced, and then the topological rules of reported 3D COFs are analyzed and summarized. Furthermore, the structural determination methods of 3D COFs is described, and finally, some prospects toward the structural problem of 3D COFs are proposed.








Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) constitute a new type of crystalline materials that consist of a range of porous structures with numerous applications in the fields of adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because of the complexity of the three&#8208;periodic net structure, it is desirable to develop a thorough structural comprehension, along with a means to precisely determine the actual structure. Indeed, such advancements would considerably contribute to the rational design and application of 3D COFs. In this review, the reported topologies of 3D COFs are introduced and categorized according to the configurations of their building blocks, and a comprehensive overview of diffraction&#8208;based structural determination methods is provided. The current challenges and future prospects for these materials will also be discussed.

Functional amyloid (FAs), particularly the bacterial proteins CsgA and FapC, have many useful properties as biomaterials: high stability, efficient, and controllable formation of a single type of amyloid, easy availability as extracellular material in bacterial biofilm and flexible engineering to introduce new properties. CsgA in particular has already demonstrated its worth in hydrogels for stable gastrointestinal colonization and regenerative tissue engineering, cell&#8208;specific drug release, water&#8208;purification filters, and different biosensors. It also holds promise as catalytic amyloid; existing weak and unspecific activity can undoubtedly be improved by targeted engineering and benefit from the repetitive display of active sites on a surface. Unfortunately, FapC remains largely unexplored and no application is described so far. Since FapC shares many common features with CsgA, this opens the window to its development as a functional scaffold. The multiple imperfect repeats in CsgA and FapC form a platform to introduce novel properties, e.g., in connecting linkers of variable lengths. While exploitation of this potential is still at an early stage, particularly for FapC, a thorough understanding of their molecular properties will pave the way for multifunctional fibrils which can contribute toward solving many different societal challenges, ranging from CO2 fixation to hydrolysis of plastic nanoparticles.

         <title>Responsively Degradable Nanoarmor&#8208;Assisted Super Resistance and Stable Colonization of Probiotics for Enhanced Inflammation&#8208;Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

A superior armored probiotic (EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA) with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease. EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA shows excellent prophylactic efficacy and therapeutic performance against dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced colitis including alleviating inflammation, restoring intestinal barrier function, and reshaping the dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria.








Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Intense Left&#8208;handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Nematic Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Composite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) derived luminescent materials exhibit intense and multicolored left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (CPL), opening the way for the practical application of nanocellulosic chirality in durable multimode anticounterfeiting and enantioselective photopolymerization. The versatility, high glum, and large &#934; of this system will promote its applications in chiral sensing, chiroptical devices, 3D display technologies, and CPL chiral imaging.








Abstract
Integrating optically active components into chiral photonic cellulose to fabricate circularly polarized luminescent materials has transformative potential in disease detection, asymmetric reactions, and anticounterfeiting techniques. However, the lack of cellulose&#8208;based left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (L&#8208;CPL) emissions hampers the progress of these chiral functionalizations. Here, this work proposes an unprecedented strategy: incorporating a chiral nematic organization of hydroxypropyl cellulose with robust aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens to generate intense L&#8208;CPL emission. By utilizing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as a good solvent for fluorescent components and cellulose matrices, this work produces a right&#8208;handed chiral nematic structure film with a uniform appearance in reflective and fluorescent states. Remarkably, this system integrates a high asymmetric factor (0.51) and an impressive emission quantum yield (55.8%) into one fascinating composite. More meaningfully, this approach is versatile, allowing for the incorporation of luminogen derivatives emitting multicolored L&#8208;CPL. These chiral fluorescent films possess exceptional mechanical flexibility (toughness up to 0.9 MJ m&#8722;3) and structural stability even under harsh environmental exposures, making them promising for the fabrication of various products. Additionally, these films can be cast on the fabrics to reveal multilevel and durable anticounterfeiting capabilities or used as a chiral light source to induce enantioselective photopolymerization, thereby offering significant potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid additive is proposed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi&#8208;transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST&#8208;OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE). Herein, a novel solid additive named&#160;1,3&#8208;diphenoxybenzene (DB) is employed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor molecular aggregation and crystallinity, which effectively broadens the spectral response of ST&#8208;OSCs&#160;in near&#8208;infrared region. Besides, more visible light is allowed to pass through the devices, which enables ST&#8208;OSCs to possess satisfactory photocurrent and high average visible transmittance (AVT) simultaneously. Consequently, the optimal ST&#8208;OSC based on PP2+DB/BTP&#8208;eC9+DB achieves a superior LUE of 4.77%, representing the highest value within AVT range of 40&#8211;50%, which also correlates with the formation of multi&#8208;scale phase&#8208;separated morphology. Such results indicate that the ST&#8208;OSCs can simultaneously meet the requirements for minimum commercial efficiency and plant photosynthesis when integrated with the roofs of agricultural greenhouses. This work emphasizes the significance of additives to tune the spectral response in ST&#8208;OSCs, and charts the way for organic photovoltaics in economically sustainable agricultural development.

         <title>Engineering a Dynamic Solvent&#8208;Phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal surface (Li&#8211;PFbTHF) is developed to improve the cycling performance of practical Li metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes. Evidence from advanced techniques indicated that the C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups of PFbTHF induce LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long&#8208;term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.








Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

Consequently, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long-term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent-phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro-butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt-derived SEI formation. The solvent-phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F-rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab-initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full-cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt-derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate-based LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interlayer Biatomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of 2D Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve 100% activation is reported of atoms on the basal plane of 2D layered materials by constructing an interlayer biatomic bridge. New gap states at the Fermi level are introduced and interlayer conductivity is enhanced in this catalyst. Exposed basal plane atoms are optimized to a state favorable for adsorbing catalytic intermediates.








Abstract
2D layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane with saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, a novel approach is reported to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer biatomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results from the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV). This study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid&#8208;state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine&#8208;tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>

         <dc:description>
A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.








Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self&#8208;adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg&#160;m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1 with a high efficiency of 93.7% under 1&#160;sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M&#8208;EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion&#8208;detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion&#8208;detecting element for edge&#8208;level neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

         <title>Competing Mechanisms Determine Oxygen Redox in Doped Ni&#8211;Mn Based Layered Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the well&#8208;known P2 to O2 phase transition, oxygen redox is a main bottleneck for capacity retention. Using synchrotron&#8208;based methods, it is revealed that competing mechanisms between Ni and Mg (or Li, Zn, and Cu) are critical for controlling the degree of oxygen redox in doped Ni&#8211;Mn based layered oxides in Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cation doping is an effective strategy for improving the cyclability of layered oxide cathode materials through suppression of phase transitions in the high voltage region. In this study, Mg and Sc are chosen as dopants in P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, and both have found to&#160;positively impact the cycling stability, but influence the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based methods and theoretical calculations it is shown that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity is also a critical aspect that dictates the performance. With Mg doping, the Ni activity can be enhanced while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn&#8208;based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. This contradiction is addressed by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33&#8208;xMn0.67O2 (x&#160;&lt;&#160;0&#160;&lt;&#160;0.33). These findings provide a new direction in understanding the effects of cation doping on the electrochemical behavior of layered oxides.

         <title>Physically and Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a pivotal component within solar devices, the electrode has a profound impact on the device performance. Herein, device configuration based on the physically and chemically stable molybdenum electrode is engineered to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in perovskite solar cells. A titanium seed layer is further introduced to optimize the electrode interfacial contact. 








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrate the high diffusion barrier of Mo ions within the device. Structural and morphology characterization also reveals the negligible plastic deformation and halide&#8208;metal reaction during aging when Mo is in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction is further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C60/SnO2/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which is among the highest value for PSCs based on Mo electrodes. Meanwhile, the device shows negligible performance decay after 2000 h operation, and retains 91% of the initial value after 1300 h at 50&#8211;60 &#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opens an effective avenue to all&#8208;round stable electrode design in high&#8208;performance PSCs.

This novel and sustainable electrolyte not only presents enhanced safety and the ability to prevent aluminum dissolution, but also enables the realization of lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with excellent energy&#8208;to&#8208;power performance and outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 m LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Multicolor Emissions of the Coumarin&#8208;Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals and LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

By introducing coumarin molecule, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum are systemically prepared. The Cs3EuCl6 NC can achieve an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. Here, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are systemically prepared. Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6&#8208;NC&#8208;based red light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs as an intermediate state, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide-based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-NC-based red light-emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the most excellent reported for lead-free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half-life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing the performance of most reported lead-free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide-based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy-efficient, and long-lasting display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven microrobotic superstructure is designed for navigation in microscale environments. The superstructure consists of microhelices interlocked with a gelatin composite chassis containing iron oxide nanoparticles. The helices serve as the motion component, while the nanoparticles enable the gelatin to dissolve via magnetic hyperthermia. Upon dissolution, the helices are released and navigate through smaller conduits using a rotating field.








Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, a microrobotic superstructure is proposed, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). The superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field, is showcased. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which can be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.








Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor endothelial expression of CD93 inversely correlates with the tumor vasculature normalization and immune activation. Ultrasound molecular imaging CD93 using targeted MBs armed with MMRN2, an endogenous ligand of CD93, provides a noninvasive and accurate strategy to evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and predict immunotherapy response.








Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics, able to predict immune microenvironment, is important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consist a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane (CM) /lipid hybrid membrane is then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.

         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;shaped flexible temperature sensors with outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics (broad working range and high sensitivity) are achieved through a two&#8208;step synthetic method. The temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in various applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.








Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8211;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method is introduced for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15 to 60&#160;&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;Dependent Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Scintillation for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenothiazine derivatives exhibiting intriguing polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescent radioluminescence features in the crystal under X&#8208;ray irradiation are synthesized. The results reveal that stabilizing triplet excitons by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can achieve efficient X&#8208;ray phosphorescent scintillation. The low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1 of resulting scintillators demonstrates the potential of flexible and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescent scintillating materials have shown great potential for applications in radiography and radiation detection due to their efficient utilization of excitons. However, revealing the relationship between molecule stacking and the phosphorescent radioluminescence of scintillators is still challenging. This study reports on two phenothiazine derivatives with polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescence radioluminescence. The experiments reveal that molecule stacking significantly affects the non&#8208;radiation decay of the triplet excitons of scintillators, which further determines the phosphorescence scintillation performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These phosphorescent scintillators exhibit high radio stability and have a low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1. Additionally, the potential application of these scintillators in X&#8208;ray radiography, based on their X&#8208;ray excited radioluminescence properties, is demonstrated. These findings provide a guideline for obtaining high&#8208;performance phosphorescent scintillating materials by shedding light on the effect of crystal packing on the radioluminescence of organic molecules.

         <title>Breaking&#8208;Down Tumoral Physical Barrier by Remotely Unwrapping Metal&#8208;Polyphenol&#8208;Packaged Hyaluronidase for Optimizing Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>

Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here, the authors propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged hyaluronidase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes.








Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here a remotely unwrapping strategy is proposed of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH can be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation, and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ion transporting membranes enhance power density during osmotic energy conversion. In this study, positively charged propidium&#8208;based 2D polymer membranes are synthesized with both skeleton and intrinsic space charges. When mixing artificial seawater and river water, a great power density of 48 W m&#8722;2 is achieved, surpassing the performance of most nanofluidic membranes.








Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8776;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

         <title>Functionality Modulation Toward Thianthrene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodical functionality modulation is carried out to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The incorporation of cyanovinylene linkage enhances the hydrophilicity and stability of the porous polymers. Furthermore, a gradual insertion of electroactive moieties into the structural backbone leads to the construction of a hollow spherical porous polymer as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, a systematic strategy is introduced for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C&#9552;C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of &#8776;65 mV (in 0.5 m H2SO4) and &#8776;283 mV (in 1 m KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibits superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions above Room Temperature in a van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 are observed through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy . Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range. Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach is employed to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions are observed in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8211;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. The research establishes Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pivoting to advanced computational methods accelerates the discovery of optimal proton conductors. Calculations predict that BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) exhibits superior conductivity and stability over existing materials. Experimental studies confirm these insights, demonstrating outstanding performance in BSCYb&#8208;based protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). This research underscores the potential of computational methodologies in propelling more efficient PCEC systems for power generation and fuel production.









Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here, this work reports the findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. This work methodically computes the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, these findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate the computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600 &#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600 &#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000&#8208;h when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Mechanical Disruption of &#946;&#8208;Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibers using Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven rotary motor is co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels. Upon UV irradiation, the work produced by the continuous rotation of the motor is shown to disrupt the hydrogen bonds of the self&#8208;assembled system, leading to an endergonic gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. The structure of the original hydrogel is subsequently recovered in the dark.








Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here, it is shown that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25 &#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8211;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

         <title>Boosting the Performances of Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics via Synergetic Near&#8208;Infrared Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2&#160;nanotripods significantly enhance photon absorption in the NIR range for semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. An optical coupling&#160;multilayer&#160;consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) enhances the NIR light utilization and the visible transparency. These strategies&#160;result in a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% along with an excellent AVT of over 30%, correspond to the record LUE of 5.33%.









Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, the authors take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, it is shown that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8776;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. Its type&#8208;II multiferroic order arises from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These results on magnetoelectric effects at the atomic scale suggest new ways to engineer multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. It is demonstrated that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Nonlocal Acoustic Moir&#233; Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological transition in twisted bilayer materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found experimentally due to the inherent scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a nonlocal design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces.








Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of acoustic pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tunable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. A twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface is also experimentally demonstrated, and more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves are found. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena that are observed.

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&#8722;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real&#8208;time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the design insight into the peroxymonosulfate activation system by boosting the mass transfer performance within hydrogel interfaces for ultrafast water purification.








Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8776;6&#8211;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications is proposed. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mg min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&amp;lt;1&#160;min), cross-flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno-economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS-AOPs challenging scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an effective and controllable H2&#8208;based nanocatalytic treatment strategy in which biocompatible Au@BT NPs are constructed to catalyze H2 generation in response to ultrasound exposure to achieve anti&#8208;inflammatory effect through scavenging ROS; thus, achieving a notable therapeutic improvement in their motor function.








Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) proves to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs show adverse side effects which may induce increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability, and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) is synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Further, theoretical calculations are employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticle is first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 generation; thus, offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shells with tunable structural features for direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) based recording of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs), enabling both early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC). This work highlights the synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.








Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates are developed for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;Thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;Infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is fabricated via a microfluidic chip based on the freeze&#8208;thaw strategy. For infected macrophages, TNC releases heme to reconstruct the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.








Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate the Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust approach that utilizes single particle diffusion fingerprinting of quantum dots, along with machine learning, to map brain extracellular space features and predict the efficacy of drugs against viral encephalitis is developed.








Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, a robust approach is developed using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. These results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for the clinical translation of drugs.

An enzyme&#8208;activable mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine assembled from an amphiphilic block polymer&#8208;drug conjugate is developed for achieving efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing and deep glioblastoma (GBM) penetration. This nanomedicine interferes mitochondrial homeostasis, which mediates the process of mitocytosis for mitochondrial quality control, facilitating mitosome&#8208;mediated active transcellular transport in GBM tissues.








Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22&#8208;b&#8208;pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8211;blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Monolithic 2D Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new persistent photocurrent mechanism based on ion motion and ion&#8208;exciton coupling is proposed in two dimensional perovskites. The special charge carrier dynamics lead to the bio&#8208;plausible synaptic characteristics of the photodetectors. The light&#8208;tunable synaptic plasticity enables not only to realize image preprocessing, but also effectively recognizes target images by learning critical features.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture, and on&#8208;chip integration. Here a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling is innovated to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90&#160;s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be&#8776;1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers are constructed alternately and introduce electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into the side chains of electron donors to mediate the active sites responsible for water oxidation. Under anaerobic conditions, its H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency via water oxidation reaction reaches an impressive 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. Remarkably, the photocatalyst achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. In situ, photosynthesis of it in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8211;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors is introduced. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Highly Flexible, High&#8208;Performance, and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8208;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic showing the development of stretchable hierarchical ceramic sensors through a novel soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy, whose configuration ensures excellent mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric activity and structural robustness, including a linear response, wide&#8208;angle twisting, and wide range of stretching. This new sensor is successfully used for both wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.








Abstract
Stretchable self&#8208;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability. In this paper, a biomimetic soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy is used to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8208;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8208;shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area (SSA) from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt;20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high SSAs are targeted (&gt;2000 m2 g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, a non&#8208;etching activation strategy is demonstrated using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and SSAs reaching 3008 m2 g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation, and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh g&#8722;1 (567 F g&#8722;1) and durability of 100&#160;000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Bioengineered Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>

CellUs integrates live neutrophils enveloping a liposomal formulation of antibiotic ceftriaxone, steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug dexamethasone, and oxygen&#8208;loaded perfluorocarbon, for treating brain infections. CellUs leverages the natural chemotactic property of neutrophils to penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier, accurately targets infection sites, and synchronizes the release of therapeutic agents under the ultrasound stimulation, thereby combating both bacterial infection and excess inflammatory cytokines.








Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs,&#8221; is pioneered. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents, and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics by Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional intelligent design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to study the influence of local polarity heterogeneity on the energy storage performance in BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics. By reversely optimization, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems with nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions. 








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of polarity&#160;heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, this work establishes the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, this work analyzes the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning polarity heterogeneity.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high&#8208;amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.








Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non&#8208;contact through&#8208;transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.

         <title>Infinite Self&#8208;Propulsion of Circularly On/Discharged Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the superhydrophobic surface printed with symmetrical waved alternating potential, the droplets can be circularly charged or discharged during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000 mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propulsion of droplets in a controlled and long path at a high&#8208;speed is crucial for organic synthesis, pathological diagnosis and programable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. To date, extensive efforts have been made to achieve droplet self&#8208;propulsion by asymmetric gradient, yet, existing structural, chemical, or charge density gradients can only last for a while (&lt;50&#160;mm). Here, this work designs a symmetrical waved alternating potential (WAP) on a superhydrophobic surface to charge or discharge the droplets during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000&#160;mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second. In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.

In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ni3+/Ni2+&#8208;mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), resulting in a record&#8208;high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni2P4O12/NiTe as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts (Ni2P4O12/NiTe || Ni2P4O12/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.475 V over 500 h.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma enabled low&#8208;temperature synthesis (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C) of various mesoporous metal oxide (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, WO3, Nb2O5, and MoO3), suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. As a proof of concept, the direct synthesis of mesoporous V2O5 is demonstrated on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated polyimide film and its application as electrode materials.








Abstract
Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and are widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches are reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C), which can be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate is introduced. As a demonstration, a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor is fabricated by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance is well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The multi&#8208;output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.








Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full&#8208;current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial Fe3GeTe2 synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

&lt;p&gt;A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 3.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP-OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;NPACZ&lt;/b&gt;) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. With &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;NPACZ&lt;/b&gt; as hole transport layers, CP-OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP-OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish-green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP-OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Unique Fe3Mo3N Structure Bestowed Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Performance of the Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Double Enhancement of Radicals and Nonradicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the unique Fe3Mo3N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton&#8208;like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts are widely used in Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon&#8208;based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe2.5Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton&#8208;like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon&#8208;based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe3Mo3N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO4&#183;&#8722;) and nonradicals (1O2 and electron transport process). The integrated &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; combined material is expected to provide a new promotion strategy for Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Dipoles Regulate Anion&#8208;Derived Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After thermal reduction, BaTiO3 with surface oxygen vacancies (BTOV) exhibits stimulative adsorption and polarization for TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; due to enhanced dipoles. With the BTOV on the polypropylene separator, a locally anion&#8208;rich and Li+&#8208;rich region is formed at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface, which will promote the transport of Li+. Moreover, polarized anions are reduced promotively to form an expected SEI film.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are considered the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage devices of the next generation. However, the unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from electrolytes usually leads to high impedance, Li dendrites growth, and poor cyclability. Herein, the ferroelectric BaTiO3 with orderly arranged dipoles (BTOV) is integrated into the polypropylene separator as a functional layer. Detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that surface oxygen vacancies drive the phase transition of BaTiO3 materials and promote the ordered arrangement of dipoles. The strong dipole moments in BTOV can adsorb TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; anions selectively and promote their preferential reduction to form a SEI film enriched with inorganic LiF and LiNxOy species, thus facilitating the rapid transfer of Li+ and restraining the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the Li&#8211;Li cell with the BTOV functional layer exhibits enhanced Li plating/stripping cycling with an ultra&#8208;long life of over 7000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiFePO4 || Li (50&#160;&#181;m) full cells display excellent cycling performance exceeding 1760 cycles and superior rate performance. This work provides a new perspective for regulating SEI chemistry by introducing ordered dipoles to control the distribution and reaction of anions.

         <title>3D Noble&#8208;Metal Nanostructures Approaching Atomic Efficiency and Atomic Density Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density are synthesized by the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The mass activity and turnover frequency value of OER for Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2&#8208;C and Cu2IrOx&#8208;A. 








Abstract
Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis, however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is formidably challenging. This article proposes a robust strategy for fabricating 3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by other binary oxides. When Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) is used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2 and Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels leads to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6]. This work may attract immediate interest of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis, and beyond.

The successful construction of open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) imparts structural confinement to the catalysts, enabling concentrated carbon intermediates and facilitating smooth efflux of products along the curved sides. The nanosheet&#8208;stacked Cu2O sphere (NS&#8208;Cu2O) achieves an enhanced selectivity toward C2+ products with a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.7% at a partial current density of 286 mA cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, a catalyst featuring a nanosheet&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) is reported. Under the guidance of the finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, it is shown that exerting control over the confinement space results in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibit a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multicarbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

         <title>Development of Inverse&#8208;Opal&#8208;Structured Charge&#8208;Deficient Co9S8@nitrogen&#8208;Doped&#8208;Carbon to Catalytically Enable High Energy and High Power for the Two&#8208;Electron Transfer I+/I&#8722; Electrode</title>

An inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) is developed as a catalytic host of the iodine electrode, specifically targeting improved reaction kinetics for the two&#8208;electron transfer cascade reaction. The inherent charge&#8208;deficient nature of Co9S8@NC effectively lowers the activation energy required for the conversion reaction and enhances the physicochemical adsorption of active iodine species, leading to superior electrochemical performance even at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.








Abstract
The iodine (I) electrode involving two&#8208;electron transfer chemistry by converting between I+ and I&#8722;, has the potential to deliver theoretically doubled capacity and higher working voltage platforms, thus achieving higher energy density. However, owing to the slow kinetics of the cascade two&#8208;electron transfer reactions, the system suffers from large overpotentials and low power density, especially at high working currents and low temperatures. Here, an inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) catalyst with unique charge&#8208;deficient states is developed to promote the reaction kinetics of the I&#8722;/I+ electrode. The charge&#8208;deficient Co9S8@NC catalyst not only enables strong physicochemical adsorption with the iodine species but also significantly reduces the activation energy and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the cascade I+/I0/I&#8722; conversion reaction. Consequently, the prototypical Zn&#8214;I+/I0/I&#8722; battery equipped with the Co9S8@NC catalyst can deliver a high energy density of 554 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a stable cycle life of 5000 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, at a subzero temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C, the battery can exhibit enhanced kinetics and a high power density of 1514 W kg&#8722;1, high energy density of 485 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells has made the performance of p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure devices develop rapidly, while the relationship of function group, anchor groups, and spacers often is neglected. It is found that anchoring groups and spacers can affect the coordination between SAMs and perovskite. This work demonstrates different components of perovskites are selective to SAMs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The anchoring of SAMs at the conductiv metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, SAMs molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs are selected. It is found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favorable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This results in reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length leads to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs show efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retain 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 h. Overall, this work highlights the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;Based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable sensor able to monitor in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals, associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, is demonstrated. The device is based on hexagonal boron nitride inks made by non&#8208;covalent functionalization with pyrene derivatives, enabling to strongly enhance the sensitivity to water molecules, and device stability.








Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow for real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2Dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water, and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, strong hysteresis, low sensitivity, and cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets is demonstrated. The device shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity (RH) (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100% RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis, and no cross&#8208;sensitivity with temperature&#160;in the range of 25&#8211;60 &#176;C. The h&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real&#8208;time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with natural anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties is reported. The hydrogel possesses outstanding mechanical properties and can be further enhanced by water.

Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine, and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles is reported. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments show that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization is ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieves effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Amorphous MnO2 Lamellae Encapsulated Covalent Triazine Polymer&#8208;Derived Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped Carbon for ORR/OER Bifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is fabricated through a self&#8208;doping process coupled with in situ encapsulating strategy. Due to the predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and the abundance of multi&#8208;heteroatom catalytic active sites, the as&#8208;developed A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC can readily work as an oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction dual&#8208;functional electrocatalyst for both liquid and solid rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery.








Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1, and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions and beyond.

         <title>Multiple Cations Nanoconfinement in Ultrathin V2O5 Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics Toward High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, supramolecular&#160;self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to intercalate unitary cation including NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+ and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) in ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets. The success on multiple cations nanoconfinement enables very fast zinc ion diffusion kinetics and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. The optimized diffusion coefficient of zinc ion (7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date.








Abstract
Nanoconfinement of cations in layered oxide cathode is an important approach to realize advanced zinc ion storage performance. However, thus far, the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal route for this nanoconfinement has been restricted to its uncontrollable phase structure and the difficulty on the multiple cation co&#8208;confinement simultaneously. Herein, this work reports a general, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets using various unitary cations including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, NH4+, and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ +Mg2+). The unitary cation confinement results in a remarkable increase in the specific capacity and Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, and the multiple cation confinement gives rise to superior structural and cycling stability by multiple cation synergetic pillaring effect. The optimized diffusion coefficient of Zn&#8208;ion (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date. The work develops a novel multiple&#8208;cations nanoconfinement strategy toward high&#8208;performance cathode for aqueous battery. It also provides new insights into the guest cation regulation of zinc&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics through a general, supramolecular assembly pathway.

         <title>Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation&#8208;Expansion&#8208;Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long&#8208;Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Microencapsulation of PbI2 and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI2&#8208;ammonium salt reaction through poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high&#8208;quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.








Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3. Moreover, profiting from the protection of poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite is markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gain a robust power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintain 91% of their initial PCE for 13&#160;008 h in a desiccated ambient environment and retain 92% PCE after storage for 4000 h with a relative humidity of 50 &#177; 10%, which is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art long&#8208;term stability among the reported contributions.

         <title>Piezoionic Elastomers by Phase and Interface Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Energy&#8208;Harvesting Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents phase and interface engineering to design piezoionic elastomers with integrated microphase&#8208;separated structures and an intermediate phase. It addresses the significant challenges associated with harmonizing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability in piezoionic and piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasisolid states. Herein, phase and interface engineering strategy is introduced to address this dilemma and a piezoionic elastomer is presented that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#181;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, this elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Control of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) is observed in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. The output of one of the CSI components switches off with the commensurability of the CDW phases. First&#8208;principles calculations support that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI.








Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long&#8208;range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although the understanding of the fundamental character of CDW is enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures is shown by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions is observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears, and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. The results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II) oxalate as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride is used to regulate the hot carrier cooling kinetics, increase the carrier diffusion length, and prolong the carrier lifetime. Based on this strategy, the champion efficiencies of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are 23.36% and 27.56%, accompanied by significantly improved long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells; However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) is introduced into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices show excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relationship between the molecular structure and the vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology of PPHJ OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge is first established. A ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP is elaborately constructed to achieve better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, resulting in impressive efficiency of 19.09%.








Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs is established by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. The morphological evolution mechanism is revealed by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors (Ds) and acceptors (As). The findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, it is also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP leads to enhanced miscibility between Ds and As, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, a ternary PPHJ device is meticulously designed with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and an impressive efficiency of 19.09% is achieved. This work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, not only the formation of VPS morphology can be controlled, but also energy losses can be reduced, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

CD93&#8208;Targeted Microbubbles
In article number 2310421, Qiuyang Li, Lijun Yuan, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel ultrasound contrast microbubble for evaluation of immune status through molecular imaging of endothelial CD93 expression. High levels of CD93 in tumor vasculature correlate well with immune cell infiltration deficiency, and ultrasound imaging of CD93 with MMRN2&#8208;modified microbubbles holds as a promising strategy to assess the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.

Mesoporous Metal Oxides
In article number 2311809 by Hong Chul Moon, Taesung Kim, Jin Kon Kim, and co&#8208;workers, a new synthetic approach for mesoporous metal oxides by exploiting synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma is introduced. This synthetic method can be universally applied to various mesoporous metal oxides and can even be directly applied to the synthesis on a plastic substrate. This approach is expected to pave the way for a wide range of flexible electronics.

On&#8208;Skin Electronics
In article number 2308831, Hao Wu, Yutian Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel to capture electromyography signals. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation and enhanced mechanical performance. Hydrogel devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.

Microrobots
In article number 2310084, Salvador Pan&#233;, Minsoo Kim, Hao Ye, and co&#8208;workers introduce microrobotic superstructures comprising a magnetic gelatin composite chassis threaded with iron helical micromachines. Magnetic inputs can be used to navigate the superstructure (gradients) and also dissolve the chassis through magnetic hyperthermia, thereby releasing the micromachines to navigate through narrow channels. The capability of these micromachines to disassemble on&#8208;command to access narrower conduits enhances the microrobots' multifunctionality.

Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been extensively developed as potentially transformative in vitro models to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs. The latest developments toward intelligent organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems where sensing, data processing, and modulating units are integrated and coordinated to fine&#8208;tune the in vitro models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications are reviewed.








Abstract
In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass have great potential for carbon emission reduction. This review covers the fundamental properties of biomass and the hydrothermal environment, the intrinsic mechanisms and regulation methods of biomass hydrothermal carbonization, the wide range of applications of derived carbon materials, and the sustainability potential of carbon materials.








Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.








Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches. Furthermore, new trends and future directions for&#160;as&#160;prevailed commercialization of aerogels as plastic materials are discussed.

         <title>Revitalizing Ancient Mitochondria with Nano&#8208;Strategies: Mitochondria&#8208;Remedying Nanodrugs Concentrate on Disease Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial quality decrease, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and inflammation are the major features of multiple types of diseases of mitochondrial damage. Mitochodnria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs with different characteristics and remarkable brilliance are committed to ameliorating various diseases by rescuing mitochondria via repairing mitochondrial quality, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, inhibiting mPTP and inflammation response and mitochondrial bionics.








Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. This review elucidates the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease are detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions are widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C = C Cross&#8208;linking strategy is an effective tool to improve the chem&#8208;physic, optoelectronic, and soluton&#8208;processing capacities of organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) for optoelectronic applications. This review mainly describes the structural type, characterization method, and unique property of the C = C cross&#8208;linking OCMs system, and further summarizes their application in the field of organic optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consist of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. The cross&#8208;linked strategy provides an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allows for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent physicochemical properties, and substantial improvement in device fabrication. An unsaturated double carbon&#8211;carbon bond (C = C) is universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, the authors will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction are also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and physicochemical property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, and unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach is presented, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, the authors offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via the cross&#8208;linking strategy.

         <title>Interlayer Engineering of Layered Materials for Efficient Ion Separation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational construction and microenvironment regulation of interlayer nanochannels are of vital importance for the realization of efficient ion separation and storage. This review systematically summarizes the interlayer engineering strategies of layered materials and discusses their effects on ion separation and storage, which provide guidance for designing high&#8208;performance separation membranes and battery electrodes.








Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their 2D derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with a focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active organic materials, including electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, are discussed individually. The challenges, solutions, and perspectives are also proposed in this review.








Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Versatile nitrogen-centered organic redox-active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal-ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen-centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen-centered redox-active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen-centered redox-active materials in AMIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is presented. RTP can be achieved by small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystal, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic host and guest, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The constructions, RTP properties, and applications of supramolecular assembly systems are discussed in detail. This review lays the foundation for developing RTP supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission, and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

This review analyzes machine learning methods for studying achiral nanomaterials and offers guidance for adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials in the context of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented, offering insights on leveraging machine learning for these complex relationships. Key achievements, challenges, and outlook for machine learning in chiral nanomaterials research are discussed.








Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.
