         <title>An Open&#8208;Environment Tactile Sensing System: Toward Simple and Efficient Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent triboelectric tactile sensing system is proposed that combines triboelectric nanogenerator technology and deep&#8208;learning technology. Independent of touch conditions and external environmental conditions, the tactile sensing system can achieve accurate, simple, and real&#8208;time material identification.








Abstract
Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines a TENG and deep&#8208;learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. The tactile sensing system is exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real&#8208;time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and has been widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, we extend the notion of band topology from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike the wave systems that are usually Hermitian, the diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. Via direct probe of the temperature diffusion, we experimentally retrieve the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice, and observe the emergence of topological edge decays within the gap of bulk decays. Our results show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorders. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based Adaptive Photo Encoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitute the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here we introduce a medium scale integrated (MSI) circuit comprised of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21 memtransistors based on photosensitive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer MoS2 for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information. We show that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, i.e., higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in our photo encoder is exploited for adaptive photo encoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1 &#956;J by the 2D memtransistor&#8208;based photo encoder highlights the benefits in&#8208;sensor and bio&#8208;inspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, A killer of Mg Anode in Mist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/striping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg metal anode in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the Mg metal anode failure has raising concerns when cycling under practical areal capacity (&gt; 4&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, we illustrate that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in wide range of current densities (&#8804; 5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under the moderate current densities (0.1&#8208;1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing Mg metal anode failure or short circuit of battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, we illustrate that this current dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of Mg metal anode must be considered comprehensively for the practical Mg metal batteries.

         <title>Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High Performance Blue Energy Harvester</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8208;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fishes, we construct sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes which lead to high performance salinity gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from 1D straight nanochannel (45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8764;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude for charge density. Thus, abundant surface charge and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. We demonstrate new routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance.

         <dc:description>
Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light&#8208;absorption efficiency and high carrier&#8208;recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.








Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable&#8208;electronic&#8208;structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, perspectives on the challenges for future strain&#8208;promoted photocatalysis are discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.

         <title>Intrinsically High Magnetic Performance in Core&#8211;Shell Structural (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;Based Permanent Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) in (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;based magnet is demonstrated via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process, resulting in the relatively high anisotropy field of 9.24 T in the optimized alloy. It provides an innovative strategy and has important significance for the design of high&#8208;performance magnets.








Abstract
ThMn12&#8208;type SmFe12&#8208;based permanent magnets have exhibited great potential in advanced magnet motors because of their high temperature stability of magnetic properties. However, the applications could be seriously limited due to the trade&#8208;off between phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties. In this work, an effective solution is demonstrated by constructing the core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process. The anisotropy field for the (Sm0.75Y0.25)(Fe0.8Co0.2)11.25Ti0.75 alloy is mostly optimized to be 9.24 T at room temperature. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the pinning process of domain walls by the magnetic&#8208;hardening Sm&#8208;rich shell, which is directly observed by in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and reconstructed by micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, the phase stability and saturation magnetization are simultaneously increased, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Y, Co, and Ti substitutions. More importantly, the high &#956;0Ms value of 1.52 T is comparable to the reported (Sm,Zr)Fe12&#8208;based bulk alloys that contain a larger amount of soft &#945;&#8208;Fe phases, indicating that this strategy is more promising toward bulk magnets. The present study provides a significant concept for the development of advanced permanent magnets and also has implications for understanding the structural origin of intrinsic magnetic configurations.

         <title>Triggering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single&#8208;Atomic Mo Sites Anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic Mo sites anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxides nanoarrays are prepared, exhibiting superior performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. In&#160;situ characterizations and the theoretical analysis collaboratively reveal that Mo incorporation triggers enhanced metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and improved reactivity of oxygen ligands, leading to feasible lattice oxygen oxidation mechanisms.








Abstract
Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single&#8208;atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In&#160;situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope&#8208;labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single&#8208;atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication, protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15&#160;versus 19 h) and decreases in motility (30&#160;versus 15&#160;&#956;m/h). The cytosol viscosity increases 3&#8208;fold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by A Camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions and accumulates in mitochondria through electrostatic attraction. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. In vitro results indicate that the meta&#8208;Defensomes successfully reprogram mitochondrial metabolism of RAW 246.7&#8208;differentiated M1 macrophages by restoring aerobic respiration by scavenging mtROS and inhibiting mtNOS, thereby increasing TFAM expression. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into CIOA mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score. Therefore, reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in clinical practice.

&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low-grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction with a camouflaged meta-Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta-Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor-ligand interactions and accumulates in mitochondria through electrostatic attraction.

         <title>Catalytic Growth of Ultralong Graphene Nanoribbons on Insulating Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;long graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of &#8776;2 nm are directly grown on insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrates through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition. These ultranarrow GNRs feature a typical bandgap of &#8776;1 eV, which is suitable for fabricating field&#8208;effect devices. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of a few nanometers are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications due to their structurally tunable bandgaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and exceptional stability. However, the direct growth of micrometer&#8208;long GNRs on insulating substrates, which is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices, remains an immense challenge. Here, the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrate through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is reported. Ultranarrow GNRs with lengths of up to 10&#160;&#181;m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals an average width of 2&#160;nm and a typical bandgap of &#8776;1&#160;eV for similar GNRs grown on conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation of GNRs and carbon nanotubes during the nucleation stage, and van der Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h&#8208;BN substrate throughout the growth stage. This&#160;study provides a scalable, single&#8208;step method for growing micrometer&#8208;long narrow GNRs on insulating substrates, thus opening a route to explore the performance of high&#8208;quality GNR devices and the fundamental physics of 1D moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>A Print&#8208;and&#8208;Fuse Strategy for Sacrificial Filaments Enables Biomimetically Structured Perfusable Microvascular Networks with Functional Endothelium Inside 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting&#8208;printed thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) scaffolds with biomimetic geometry are integrated into customized microscopy&#8208;compliant bioreactor. Filling of the bioreactor with a hydrogel precursor solution induces fusion of adjacent filaments in the scaffolds (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Subsequent temperature decrease below the lower critical solution temperature produces perfusable microchannels with circular cross&#8208;sections, biomimetic volume&#8208;ratio between mother and daughter channels, and leakage&#8208;free fluid connection that enable rapid endothelialization.








Abstract
A facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels is presented. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using melt electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. The aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#160;&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that are deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes that approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Directing Charge Transfer in a Chemical&#8208;Bonded BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky Heterojunction for Piezoelectric Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BaTiO3@ReS2&#160;piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system with interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond exhibits excellent synergy between piezoelectric and photocatalytic. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric response can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons. The interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond ensures the formation of a seamless contact interface and acts as the &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the electron transfer.








Abstract
The piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system, which can utilize solar energy and mechanical energy simulteneously, is promising but still challenging in the environmental remediation field. In this work, a novel metal&#8211;semiconductor BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky heterostructure is designed and it shows high&#8208;efficiency on piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation. By combining experiment and calculation results, the distorted metal&#8208;phase ReS2 nanosheets are found to be closely anchored on the surface of the BaTiO3 nanorods, through interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bonds. The Schottky heterostructure not only forms electron&#8208;transfer channels but also exhibits enhanced oxygen activation capacity, which are helpful to produce more superoxide radicals. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric BaTiO3 can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons directing to the ReS2. As a result of the synergy effect between the two components, the BaTiO3@ReS2 exhibits untrahigh activity for degradation of pollutants with an apparent rate constant of 0.133 min&#8722;1 for piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis, which is 16.6 and 2.44 times as that of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, respectively. This performance is higher than most reported BaTiO3&#8208;based piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis systems. This work paves the way for the design of high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation through using green energies in nature.

         <title>Advances in the Development of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cycling stability and rate performance of Li&#8211;S batteries are adversely affected by the formation of Li dendrites and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can effectively guide Li deposition and suppress polysulfide migration, thus holding great promise for Li&#8211;S batteries. The recent progress in the development of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
Although lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling.

&lt;p&gt;The cycling stability and rate performance of Li&#8211;S batteries are adversely affected by the formation of Li dendrites and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can effectively guide Li deposition and suppress polysulfide migration, thus holding great promise for Li&#8211;S batteries. The recent progress in the development of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically summarized and analyzed.

         <title>Enhanced Dual&#8208;Directional Sulfur Redox via a Biotemplated Single&#8208;Atomic Fe&#8211;N2 Mediator Promises Durable Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8211;N2 single&#8208;atomic catalyst accommodated by a biomorphic hierarchical C3N4 support from a biomass template readily boosts the dual&#8208;directional conversion kinetics of lithium sulfide and realizes high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is considered as an appealing candidate for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of high energy and low cost. Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single&#8208;atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (&#8776;6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA&#8208;CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA&#8208;CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA&#8208;CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li&#8211;S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy and Safe Lithium Battery Enabled by Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry in a Fireproof Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of a molecular Li2S cathode and Si anode in a fireproof gel electrolyte enables a high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery with long life, good temperature adaptability, negligible self&#8208;discharge, and remarkable safety against extreme abuse in the air, water, or even on fire.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed thriving efforts in pursuing high&#8208;energy batteries at an unaffordable cost of safety. Herein, a high&#8208;energy and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery is proposed by solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of polymer&#8208;based molecular Li2S cathode in a fireproof gel electrolyte. This chemistry fully eliminates not only the negative effect of extremely reactive Li metal and oxygen species on cell safety but also the damage of electrode reversibility by soluble redox intermediates. The molecular Li2S cathode exhibits an exceptional lifetime of 2000 cycles, 100% Coulombic efficiency, high capacity of 830 mA&#160;h g&#8722;1 with ultralow capacity loss of 0.005&#8211;0.01% per cycle and superior rate capability up to 10 C. Meanwhile, it shows high stability in the carbonate&#8208;involving electrolyte for maximizing the compatibility with carbonate&#8208;efficient Si anode. The optimized cell chemistry exerts high energy over 750&#160;W&#160;h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles with fast rate response, high&#8208;temperature adaptability, and no self&#8208;discharge. A fire&#8208;retardant composite gel electrolyte is developed to further strengthen the intrinsic safe redox between the Li2S cathode and the Si anode, which secures remarkable safety against extreme abuse of overheating, short circuits, and mechanical damage in air/water or even when on fire.

         <title>Enhancing Transition Dipole Moments of Heterocyclic Semiconductors via Rational Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution for Sensitive Near Infrared Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic semiconductors with stretched geometry show enhanced transition dipole moments, leading to large absorption coefficients of up to 4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1 beyond 900&#160;nm in thin films. The self&#8208;powered organic photodetectors in this work show high detectivity (1012 to 2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones) over a broad spectrum of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm, comparable with some commercial inorganic photodetectors.








Abstract
Designing ultrastrong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing organic semiconductors is a critical prerequisite for sensitive NIR thin film organic photodetectors (OPDs), especially in the region of beyond 900&#160;nm, where the absorption coefficient of commercial single crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) is below 103 cm&#8722;1. Herein, a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic core (named as BPPT) with strong electron&#8208;donating property and stretched geometry is developed. Relative to their analogue Y6, BPPT&#8208;contained molecules, BPPT&#8208;4F and BPPT&#8208;4Cl, show substantially upshifted and more delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals, and larger transition dipole moments, leading to bathochromic and hyperchromic absorption spectra extending beyond 1000&#160;nm with very large absorption coefficients (up to 3.7&#8211;4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) as thin films. These values are much higher than those (104 to 1 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) of typical organic semiconductors, and 1&#8211;2 orders higher than those of commercial inorganic materials, such as c&#8208;Si, Ge, and InGaAs. The OPDs based on BPPT&#8208;4F or BPPT&#8208;4Cl blending polymer PBDB&#8208;T show high detectivity of above 1012 Jones in a wide wavelength range of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm with excellent peak values of 1.3&#8211;2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones, respectively, which are comparable with and even better than those commercial inorganic photodetectors.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Pathway on Spinel Oxides via Surficial Geometrical&#8208;Site Occupation Modification Driven by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production, which proceeds via four&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron pathways, respectively. Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&#8722; or the 2e&#8722; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo2O4 can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated as a critical technology for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production. Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo2O4 oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; ORR. Interestingly, the as&#8208;synthesized MnCo2O4&#8208;pristine (MnCo2O4&#8208;P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75&#160;V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo2O4&#8208;activation (MnCo2O4&#8208;A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four&#8208;electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92&#160;V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo2O4&#8208;A toward the 4e&#8722; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.

&lt;p&gt;The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production, which proceeds via four-electron or two-electron pathways, respectively. Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.

         <title>Dynamic Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Tunable Handedness and Intensity Enabled by Achiral Dichroic Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes, P1 and N1, are designed as anisotropic chromophores in the long and short molecular axes with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl derivatives in SLC1717 medium. Dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) handedness and intensity are achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are chiral supramolecular systems that self&#8208;assemble into a highly regular helical arrangement in a liquid crystal (LC) medium. Such an arrangement is highly beneficial for the chiral enlargement effect on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Dichroic dyes with rod&#8208;like molecular structures can exhibit fluorescence anisotropy along both the long and short molecular axes owing to their transition dipole moment (TDM) vectors. In this work, a pair of donor&#8211;accepter (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes is prepared, namely, 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene derivative (P1, whose TDM vector is parallel to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&gt; F&#8869;) and anthraquinone derivative (N1, whose TDM vector is perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&lt; F&#8869;). CLCs can be fabricated by doping P1 or N1 together with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;derived inducers into SLC1717 medium. Dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity is achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity enabled by TDM regulation of achiral dichroic dyes in a CLC medium.

         <title>Microstructured Hydrogels to Guide Self&#8208;Assembly and Function of Lung Alveolospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epithelial cell organoids provide a system to probe tissue development and disease in vitro and for cell transplantation. Within the lung field, alveolar organoids almost exclusively depend on Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions. In this work, the design of an accessible hydrogel system with predefined microcavities to generate alveolar organoids through self&#8208;assembly and maintenance of progenitor cell fate and function is described.








Abstract
Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within 3D Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, a method is described that relies on hyaluronic acid hydrogels for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self&#8208;assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel&#8208;free conditions. By engineering predefined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure is reduced when compared to 3D culture, while maintaining the alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2&#8208;derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible system for the culture of iPSC&#8208;derived lung progenitors and the method can be expanded to the culture of primary mouse tissue derived AT2 and other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition (IVD) Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, we report the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition (IVD). This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and co&#8208;evaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>Ni&#8211;Co Bimetallic Hydroxide Nanosheet Arrays Anchored on Graphene for Adsorption&#8208;Induced Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of transition metal hydroxide NixCoy&#8211;graphene oxide (GR) composites forming porous aerogels with hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure are synthesized by using a simple in situ growth method. Through doping with an appropriate amount of electron&#8208;rich Co, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits the best photocatalytic performance due to excellent CO2 adsorption capacity, photoinduced electron/hole separation, and electron&#8208;transport efficiency.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can be implemented to use CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a resource in an energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly way, in which suitable catalytic materials are required to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Insufficient accessible active sites on the catalyst surface and inhibited electron transfer severely limit the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, porous aerogels are constructed from composites comprising different ratios of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide (NixCoy) grown on reduced graphene oxide (GR) into a hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure using a facile in situ growth method. Detailed characterization shows that this structure exposes numerous active sites for enhanced adsorption&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Moreover, under the synergistic effect of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide, the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as charge&#8208;carrier separation and transfer are excellent. As a result, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.

Through doping with an appropriate amount of electron-rich Co, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits the best photocatalytic performance due to excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity, photoinduced electron/hole separation, and electron-transport efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction can be implemented to use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a greenhouse gas, as a resource in an energy-saving and environmentally friendly way, in which suitable catalytic materials are required to achieve high-efficiency catalysis. Insufficient accessible active sites on the catalyst surface and inhibited electron transfer severely limit the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, porous aerogels are constructed from composites comprising different ratios of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide (Ni&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Co&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) grown on reduced graphene oxide (GR) into a hierarchical nanosheet-array structure using a facile in situ growth method. Detailed characterization shows that this structure exposes numerous active sites for enhanced adsorption-induced photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Moreover, under the synergistic effect of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity as well as charge-carrier separation and transfer are excellent. As a result, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, NFMO with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered.

Abstract
The layered sodium transition metal oxide, NaTMO2 (TM = transition metal), with a binary or ternary phases has displayed outstanding electrochemical performance as a new class of strategy cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an in&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, Na0.76Ni0.20Fe0.40Mn0.40O2 with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. Structural visualization on an atomic scale is also provided and the following findings are unveiled: i) the existence of a mixed&#8208;phase intergrowth layer distribution and unequal distribution of P2 and O3 phases along two different crystal plane indices and ii) a complete reversible charge/discharge process for the initial two cycles that displays a simple phase transformation, which is unprecedented. Moreover, first&#8208;principles calculations support the evidence of the formation of a binary NFMO&#8208;P2/O3 compound, over the proposed hypothetical monophasic structures (O3, P3, O&#8242;3, and P2 phases). As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V). It is believed that the insightful understanding of the proposed materials can introduce new perspectives for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Modules via Bilayer&#8208;Merged&#8208;Annealing Assisted Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic solar modules by blade coating are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing strategy, achieving impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.79% with an active area of 18.73 cm2, which represents the best organic solar minimodule by blade coating so far.








Abstract
Although encouraging progress is being made on spin&#8208;coated prototype cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) still face significant challenges, yet to be explored, for upscaling the multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers in the construction of large&#8208;area modules. Herein, high&#8208;performance opaque and semitransparent organic solar modules are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing (BMA)&#8208;assisted blade&#8208;coating strategy, achieving impressive efficiencies of 14.79% and 12.01% with respect to active area of 18.73 cm2, which represent the best organic solar minimodules so far. It is revealed that the BMA strategy effectively resolves the de&#8208;wetting issues between polar charge transport layer solution and non&#8208;polar bulk heterojunction blends, hence improving the film coverage, along with electronic and electric contacts of multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers. As result, organic solar modules coated under ambient conditions successfully retain the high&#8208;efficiency of small&#8208;area cells upon 312 times area scaling&#8208;up. Overall, this work provides a facile and effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar modules under ambient conditions.

         <title>Activatable Cancer Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy using Semiconducting Polymer Nanobodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanobody (SPNAb) is developed for cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Ultrasound irradiation of SPNAb can not only induce immunogenic cell death by sonodynamic therapy but also activate anti&#8208;CTLA4 antibodies to in situ trigger checkpoint blockade, resulting in enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Despite the great promises of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combination cancer therapy, its clinical applications are hindered by the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activities of therapeutic agents and the lack of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, the development of semiconducting polymers as efficient sonosensitizers and further development of sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanobodies (SPNAb) for activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. Conjugation of anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies onto the polymer nanoparticles through a 1O2&#8208;cleavable linker affords SPNAb with relatively low CTLA&#8208;4 binding affinity. Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNAb generates 1O2 not only to elicit a sonodynamic effect to induce immunogenic cell death, but also to release anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies and trigger in situ checkpoint blockade. Such a synergistic therapeutic action mediated by SPNAb modulates the tumoricidal function of T&#8208;cell immunity by promoting the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, resulting in effective tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, durable immunological memory, and prevention of relapse. Therefore, this study represents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sonodynamic strategy using semiconducting polymers for precise spatiotemporal control over immunotherapy.

         <title>Dendrimersome Synthetic Cells Harbor Cell Division Machinery of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. The interactions between this active cell machinery and the synthetic membrane are tailored by adjusting its composition. Such fine&#8208;tuning enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system and constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements.








Abstract
The integration of active cell machinery with synthetic building blocks is the bridge toward developing synthetic cells with biological functions and beyond. Self&#8208;replication is one of the most important tasks of living systems, and various complex machineries exist to execute it. In Escherichia coli, a contractile division ring is positioned to mid&#8208;cell by concentration oscillations of self&#8208;organizing proteins (MinCDE), where it severs membrane and cell wall. So far, the reconstitution of any cell division machinery has exclusively been tied to liposomes. Here, the reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. By tuning the membrane composition, the interaction of biological machinery with synthetic membranes can be tailored to reproduce its dynamic behavior. This constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements, as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering emergent biological behavior from the bottom&#8208;up.

         <title>Local Spin&#8208;State Tuning of Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst by S&#8208;Coordinated Doping for Kinetics&#8208;Boosted Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed monovalent iron(I) site with a medium&#8208;spin state is developed to promote cleavage of the N&#8801;N bonds and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of N2 hydrogenation kinetics.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) is envisaged as alternative technique to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for NH3 synthesis. However, how to develop highly active e&#8208;NRR catalysts faces daunting challenges. Herein, a viable strategy to manipulate local spin state of isolated iron sites through S&#8208;coordinated doping (FeSA&#8208;NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S in the coordination of FeSA&#8208;NSC can induce the transition of spin&#8208;polarization configuration with the formation of a medium&#8208;spin&#8208;state of Fe (t2g6 eg1), which is beneficial for facilitating eg electrons to penetrate the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of nitrogen. As a consequence, a record&#8208;high current density up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, together with a high NH3 selectivity of &#8776;10% in a flow cell reactor. Both experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the monovalent Fe(I) atomic center in the FeSA&#8208;NSC after the S doping accelerates the N2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *N2 to *NNH.

         <title>Recyclable, Healable, and Tough Ionogels Insensitive to Crack Propagation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irreversible covalent crosslinking in the matrix polymer network is avoided. The reversible entangled microdomains of the microspheres and linear segments in tough ionogels act as elastic physical crosslinking points to provide mechanical stability, dissipate stress concentration, and prevent crack propagation in any load direction. The entangled networks can be disentangled to restore the damaged mechanical properties and realize recycling.








Abstract
Most gels and elastomers introduce sacrificial bonds in the covalent network to dissipate energy. However, long&#8208;term cyclic loading caused irreversible fatigue damage and crack propagation cannot be prevented. Furthermore, because of the irreversible covalent crosslinked networks, it is a huge challenge to implement reversible mechanical interlocking and reorganize the polymer segments to realize the recycling and reuse of ionogels. Here, covalent crosslinking of host materials is replaced with entanglement. The entangled microdomains are used as physical crosslinking while introducing reversible bond interactions. The interpenetrating, entangled, and elastic microdomains of linear segments and covalent&#8208;network microspheres provide mechanical stability, eliminate stress concentration at the crack tip under load, and achieve unprecedented tear and fatigue resistance of ionogels in any load direction. Moreover, reversible entanglements and noncovalent interactions can be disentangled and recombined to achieve recycling and mechanical regeneration, and the recyclability of covalent&#8208;network microdomains is realized.

         <title>Unusual Mesoporous Titanium Niobium Oxides Realizing Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual mesoporous titanium niobium oxides@carbon (Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C) with large pore sizes and highly crystallized nanocrystals embedded in carbon frameworks are synthesized via a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy. As an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C shows exceptional performances at room temperature and even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, the sluggish ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics brought by the large radius of Na+ seriously limits the performance of SIBs, let alone at low temperatures. Herein, a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize unusual Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C for high&#8208;performance SIBs operating at room and low temperatures is proposed. The confinement self&#8208;assembly of the acid&#8211;base pair around the micelles and confined crystallization by the carbon layer realize the formation of ordered and stoichiometric mesoporous frameworks with opened ion channels. Thus, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics at 25 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which are one order higher than that of the nonporous one. A high reversible capacity of 233 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate (a specific capacity of 103 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and cycling performances (&lt;0.03% fading per cycle) can be observed at 25&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8211;x@C can still deliver the 161 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 60% and outstanding cycling stability (99 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles). It is believed this strategy opens a new avenue for constructing novel mesoporous electrode materials for low&#8208;temperature energy storage.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexing in Space&#8211;Time Thermoacoustic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space&#8211;time thermoacoustic metasurface possess unusual capacities to simultaneously manipulate sound field distributions and harmonic frequency responses. Along this frontier, a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing technique is established with a superposition of vortex beams carrying orthogonal orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum modes at distinct frequency harmonics. The synthesized dimensionality introduces entirely new physics and design philosophies to multiplexing schemes, promising unprecedented functionalities in acoustic communication devices.








Abstract
Multiplexing technology with increased information capacity plays a crucial role in the realm of acoustic communication. Different quantities of sound waves, including time, frequency, amplitude, phase, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), have been independently introduced as the physical multiplexing approach to allow for enhanced communication densities. An acoustic metasurface is decorated with carbon nanotube patches, which when electrically pumped and set to rotate, functions as a hybrid mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexer with synthetic dimensions. Based on this spatiotemporal modulation, a superposition of vortex beams with orthogonal OAMs and symmetric harmonics are both numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Also, flexible combinations of OAM modes with diverse frequency shifts are obtained by transforming the azimuthal phase distributions, which inspires a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing approach that significantly promotes the communication&#160;capacity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by coupling a broadband plasmonic metamaterial absorber with a single Cu atoms based alloy as catalytic sites. The design perfectly synergizes the effects of photothermal conversion, plasmonic hot electrons, and strong localized electric field.

Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO2 photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that are implemented in such an application are restricted in a narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with a designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, a concept of coupling a Au&#8208;based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites, respectively, is reported for gas&#8208;phase light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in a broad spectral range (370&#8211;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, and also induces strong localized electric field in favor of transfer of hot electrons and reduced energy barrier in CO2 hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of a strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light&#8208;driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.

         <title>Energy Conversion Analysis of Multilayered Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Synergistic Rain and Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance instantaneous triboelectric nanogenerator (I&#8208;TENG) and a quantitative analysis method named &#8220;kinetic energy calculation and current integration&#8221; (KECCI) are developed to promote the understanding of energy flows and working principles of TENGs in&#8208;depth. Furthermore, multi&#8208;layered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics to work synergistically. This work guides the further development of TENG and promotes its commercialization process.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology that offers excellent potential for the conversion of mechanical energy from rain into electricity for hybrid energy applications. However, a high&#8208;performance TENG is yet to be achieved because a quantitative analysis method for the energy conversion process is still lacking. Herein, a quantitative analysis method, termed the "kinetic energy calculation and current integration" (KECCI) method, which significantly improves the understanding of the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion process, is presented. Based on the KECCI method, a high&#8208;performance TENG is developed by systematically optimizing a biomimetic surface structure and instant switch design, with 1.25&#160;mA short&#8208;circuit current (Isc), 150&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), and a high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 24.89%. Furthermore, a multilayered TENG device is proposed for continuously harvesting the kinetic energy of raindrops for further improvement in the energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Finally, the multilayered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics, achieving all&#8208;weather energy harvesting. This work presents a validated theoretical basis that will guide further development of TENGs toward higher performances, which will promote the commercialization of hybrid TENG systems for all&#8208;weather applications.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Melting and Solvation Reconfiguration of Phase&#8208;Change Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous CO2 can promote the melting and reconfigure the solvation structure of a phase&#8208;change electrolyte, thereby enhancing interactions between salt anions and Li+ cations to upgrade the solid electrolyte interphase layer. Ultimately, a Li&#8211;LiFePO4 battery with CO2&#8208;saturated electrolyte exhibits prolonged cycle life. Furthermore, a Li&#8211;CO2 battery with the baseline electrolyte can cycle stably for nearly 100 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are a unique and exciting class of materials with bright prospects in wide&#8208;ranging sustainable technologies such as thermal and electrochemical energy storage. While impressive, the effect of gaseous species on PCMs remains largely unexplored hitherto. Here, a gaseous co&#8208;solvent is reported that can facilitate melting and modulate physical properties such as viscosity and ion conduction of PCMs. Especially for the appealing application of PCMs as electrolytes, gaseous species also have a critical influence on both Li+&#8208;electrolyte structure and resultant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, theoretical simulations and experimental analysis evidence that CO2 can promote melting while reconfiguring the solvation structure of a succinonitrile (SCL)&#8208;derived Li+ phase&#8208;change electrolyte (Li+&#8208;PCE) model system. Due to the enhanced interaction between Li+ cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) anions in the reconfigured solvation structure, more TFSI&#8208;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich component and extra CO2&#8208;derived Li2CO3 form in the upgraded SEI layer, thereby endowing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Li&#8208;metal batteries with prolonged cyclability. These findings may stimulate widespread interest in gas leverage to innovate electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Aqueous Colloidal Suspensions: Evidence of Density Inversion at the Isotropic&#8208;Liquid Crystal Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new low&#8208;density liquid crystalline (LC) phase in aqueous colloidal suspensions of rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is demonstrated. This behavior is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal CNCs/water interactions. The scale bar in the image is 100&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The colloidal suspensions of aqueous cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to form liquid crystalline (LC) systems above certain critical concentrations. From an isotropic phase, tactoid formation, growth, and sedimentation have been determined as the genesis of a high&#8208;density cholesteric phase, which, after drying, originates solid iridescent films. Herein, the coexistence of a liquid crystal upper phase and an isotropic bottom phase in CNC aqueous suspensions at the isotropic&#8211;nematic phase separation is reported. Furthermore, isotropic spindle&#8208;like domains are observed in the low&#8208;density LC phase and high&#8208;density LC phases are also prepared. The CNCs isolated from the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density LC phases are found to have similar average lengths, diameters, and surface charges. The existence of an LC low&#8208;density phase is explained by the presence of air dissolved in the water present within the CNCs. The air dissolves out when the water solidifies into ice and remains within the CNCs. The self&#8208;adjustment of the cellulose chain conformation enables the entrapment of air within the CNCs and CNC buoyancy in aqueous suspensions.

         <title>Metalloid&#8208;Cluster Ligands Enabling Stable and Active FeN4&#8208;Ten Motifs for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Block metalloid clusters (e.g., Ten) are found to be able to effectively mimic the role of molecular ligands in enzymes. When incorporated into a pyrolyzed FeN4&#8208;carbon framework, the obtained FeN4&#8208;Ten catalyst not only mimics the coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of CYP enzymes, but also keeps the stable nature as a heterogeneous catalyst.








Abstract
In nature, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes containing heme iron centers with an axial thiolate ligand (FeN4&#8208;S), which are among the most finely developed catalysts by natural selection. However, the exceptional ORR activity and selectivity of CYP enzymes originate from their non&#8208;rigid and self&#8208;adaptive coordination network with molecular ligands, which sacrifices the stability of the active motifs under electrochemical reaction conditions. Here, a design strategy to circumvent this dilemma by incorporating Fe&#8208;N4 motifs into carbon matrices instead of the protein scaffold and replacing the axial molecular thiolate ligand with a stable tellurium cluster (Ten) is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations indicate a moderate interaction between Fe 3d and Te 5p orbitals once n&#160;&gt; 2, allowing the Fe&#63743;Te bond to dynamically change its strength to adaptively facilitate the intermediate steps during the ORR process, which renders FeN4&#8208;Ten active sites with superior ORR activity. This adaptive behavior mimics the conformational dynamics of an enzyme during the reaction, but retains the stability nature as a heterogeneous catalyst. The experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed catalyst with a characterized FeN4&#8208;Ten structure outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst both on activity and stability.

         <title>Integrating Bi@C Nanospheres in Porous Hard Carbon Frameworks for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D carbon framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres wrapped by a carbon layer (Bi@C&#8834;CFs) is synthesized via thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework nanorods. Due to this novel and unique architecture design, the hybrid electrode indicates superior electrochemical performance as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative technology because of their merits in abundance and cost. Realizing their real applications, however, remains a formidable challenge. One is that among the limitations of anode materials, the alloy&#8208;type candidates tolerate fast capacity fading during cycling. Here, a 3D framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with a metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated carbon layer by thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanorods is synthesized as an anode material for SIBs. Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design promotes excellent sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity of 308.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of a homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Importantly, deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the performance improvement is illuminated, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.

         <title>Fabrications of Topological Solitons Array in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, which occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and time scale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and time scale. Here, we find a way to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using the cholesteric LC confined in the patterned substrates. Our experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on free energy minimization closely reconstructs our experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Polarization Engineering of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Molecular Oxygen and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Thio)urea&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are rationally designed, showing an outstanding photocatalytic activity toward production of H2O2 in water (3268.1 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with a quantum yield of 8.6% at 400 nm for the thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF) via reducing molecular oxygen (O2). This is much higher than most of the reported metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts in nonsacrificial systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is seriously inhibited by its sluggish charge kinetics. Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF (Bpt&#8208;CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc&#8208;CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400&#160;nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional&#8208;groups&#8208;mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Assembly of AIEgen&#8208;Based Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets and Seaweed Cellulose Nanofibrils for Humidity Sensing and UV&#8208;Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)&#8208;based composites, with strong fluorescence emission sensitive to relative humidity, are fabricated by integrating 4.0 wt% aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in a water suspension. The composite films also show efficient UV&#8208;shielding capacity without compromise of the optical transmittance and excellent mechanical properties, owing to the metal&#8211;carboxylate coordination between the 2D MOF nanosheets and the CNFs.








Abstract
Integrating synthetic low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with a sustainable biopolymer is a promising strategy to endow composites with attractive structural and functional properties for expanded applications. Herein, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based MOF bulk crystals are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are assembled with low amounts (0.3 to 4.0&#160;wt%) of the 2D nanosheets to generate luminescent composites. The 2D nanosheets are adsorbed onto the CNFs in dilute water suspensions owing to the flexibility of the MOF nanosheets and the high aspect ratio of the CNFs. Transparent films are prepared by solution casting from a water suspension of the CNF&#8208;MOF assembly. The fluorescence emission of the composite films is enhanced because of the favored affinity between MOF nanosheets and CNFs. Remarkably, these films demonstrate excellent UV&#8208;shielding capacity and high optical transmittance at the visible wavelength range. The composite films also show reversible changes in fluorescence emission intensity in response to ambient humidity. The tensile strength and modulus of the composite films are also enhanced owing to the increased adhesion between CNFs through the adsorbed MOF nanosheets. This work provides a novel pathway to fabricate luminescent CNFs&#8208;based composites with tunable optical properties for functional materials.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.








Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single&#8208;network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low&#8208;viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles.

&lt;p&gt;A one-pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single-network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one-pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free-radical crosslinking of methacrylate-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene-modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;-cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof-of-concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low-viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electroplating for Aqueous Zinc Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;metal anodes, which are desirable for various aqueous zinc battery chemistries, degrade over repeated cycling due to dendrite growth. It is found that dendrites can be prevented by ensuring no defective regions form during zinc deposition, thus removing sites for dendrite nucleation and ensuring purely planar deposition. This allows unprecedentedly high charging rates to be achieved.








Abstract
Despite being one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;level energy storage, practical aqueous zinc batteries are limited by dendrite formation, which leads to significantly compromised safety and cycling performance. In this study, by using single&#8208;crystal Zn&#8208;metal anodes, reversible electrodeposition of planar Zn with a high capacity of 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at an unprecedentedly high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This dendrite&#8208;free electrode is well maintained even after prolonged cycling (&gt;1200 cycles at 50 mA cm&#8722;2). Such excellent electrochemical performance is due to single&#8208;crystal Zn suppressing the major sources of defect generation during electroplating and heavily favoring planar deposition morphologies. As so few defect sites form, including those that would normally be found along grain boundaries or to accommodate lattice mismatch, there is little opportunity for dendritic structures to nucleate, even under extreme plating rates. This scarcity of defects is in part due to perfect atomic&#8208;stitching between merging Zn islands, ensuring no defective shallow&#8208;angle grain boundaries are formed and thus removing a significant source of non&#8208;planar Zn nucleation. It is demonstrated that an ideal high&#8208;rate Zn anode should offer perfect lattice matching as this facilitates planar epitaxial Zn growth and minimizes the formation of any defective regions.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;Volume Entropy in Nonequilibrium Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy near the three&#8208;phase contact line and optimized self&#8208;assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod&#8208;superstructure microassembly arrays with long&#8208;range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal&#8208;oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse.








Abstract
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures of nanoparticles with controllable orientation have advantages in applications toward sensors, photoelectric conversion, and field&#8208;effect transistors. The assembly process of nanorods in colloidal systems undergoes a nonequilibrium process from dispersion to aggregation. A variety of assembly methods such as solvent volatilization, electromagnetic field induction, and photoinduction are restricted to suppress local perturbations during the nonequilibrium concentration of nanoparticles, which are adverse to controlling the orientation and order of assembled structures. Here, a confined assembly method is reported by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy in nonequilibrium fluids to fabricate microstructure arrays based on colloidal nanorods with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order. The unique fluid dynamics of the liquid bridge is utilized to form a local region, where the free volume entropy reduction triggers assembly near the three&#8208;phase contact line (TPCL), allowing nanorods to assemble in 2D closest packing parallel to the TPCL for the maximum Gibbs free energy reduction. By manipulating the orientation of liquid flow, microstructures are assembled with programmable geometry, which sustains polarized photoluminescence and polarization&#8208;dependent photodetection. This confined assembly method opens up perspectives on assemblies of nanomaterials with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order as a platform for multifunctional integrated devices.

         <title>Controlled Doping of Electrocatalysts through Engineering Impurities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of ab&#160;initio calculations and atom probe tomography is used to evidence and rationalize B&#8208;doping of Pd nanocatalysts. The doping level is adjusted by controlling the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis conditions, that is, chemical potential and kinetics. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, an influence of B&#8208;doping on the electrocatalytic behavior toward the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby can power, for example, cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet&#8208;chemistry, gaining control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab&#160;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, they thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy.&#8221;

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;Activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedral nanobox, a kind of dynamic framework nucleic acid nanocarrier, is fabricated to completely encapsulate target siRNA and realize controllable delivery of cargo strands upon a pH&#8208;responsive switch. Based on the protective encapsulation against degradation and detachment during delivery and final active release in cells, excellent gene&#8208;silencing effects are achieved for in vitro and in vivo experiments.








Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox is fabricated for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) gene is achieved in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, the nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via Binding&#8208;Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretch&#8208;induced kinematic reorganization of Ag flakes in a viscoelastic polymer matrix can lead to spontaneous formation of new and efficient conductive pathways with enhanced conductivity, successfully addressing the conductivity&#8211;stretchability dilemma. This study establishes a fundamentally new approach to fabricate filler&#8208;reinforced stretchable conductors, paving the way for the future development of polymer composites for soft, stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic&#8208;filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, it is reported that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by &#8776;4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8776;104 S cm&#8722;1. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Line&#8208;Guided Growth of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slip lines on metal surfaces are found to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of graphene. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the orientation of graphene grown on a variety of metal facets, further enabling the controllable synthesis of single&#8208;crystal graphene and grain&#8208;boundary engineering of bicrystal graphene on designed metal facets.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging 2D materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process is demonstrated on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. Not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bicrystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations, are successfully synthesized by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bicrystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8776;21&#176; and &#8776;11&#176; are constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bicrystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In&#8208;situ Formed on Magnesium Metal Anode by Using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;based All&#8208;magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Passivation of Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes composes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is co&#8208;dissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; anion enables in&#8208;situ formation of a stable a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8211;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6THF]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[Mg(pftb)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; anion enables &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; formation of a stable a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual-layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong-cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side-reactions in a TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;-containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalating chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into Li layer of layered cathodes result in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultra&#8208;high reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low&#8208;content Li2MnO3 domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO2 domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li&#8208;ion storage in Li layers. Our work utilizs bulk cation disorder to create stable Li&#8208;ions storage tetrahedral sites and elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 demonstrated in 0.6&#8208; 4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li+ at 10&#160;mA g&#8211;1. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li&#8208;ions insertion into layered oxide materials.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>2D&#8208;Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization strategy effectively generates a new species of highly thermally conductive carbon fibers. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude more conductive than commercial PAN&#8208;based carbon fibers. These fibers have great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials, high&#8208;power electronics, and energy storage.








Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch&#8208;based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond pitch&#8208;CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, a 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN&#8208;based CFs. The self&#8208;oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non&#8208;graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials.

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex-solution are enabled. These ex-solved materials attain a record-breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone-detection reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex-solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex-solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF-derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex-solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano-sized oxides. The distinct ex-solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF-driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex-solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark-level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone-sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex-solution process rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained under the electric field for ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with the dual self-built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the pure WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. Till date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor to other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allowed us to study the property&#8208;relationship of the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains on gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, non&#8208;fluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound was identified, having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Stiffening of Shape&#8208;Memory Polyurethanes Composed of Hard Backbone Dangling PEG Soft Segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermally triggered phase transformation process and &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; achieved by lattice distortion of shape&#8208;memory alloys, a series of water&#8208;triggered stiffening shape&#8208;memory polyurethane are developed. They can achieve &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition by forming more continuous hard domains upon hydration.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Young's modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, the principle of phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape&#8208;memory metallic alloys (SMAs) is introduced to the design of molecular structures for shape&#8208;memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all&#8208;hard segments composed of main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieve a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovers. The stiffening process is driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and the soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation is enhanced and the hard domains are transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitates the shape&#8208;recovery process in the hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature (Tg). This work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape&#8208;memory property, and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from a BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;A unique BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low-cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low-cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on a Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, is reported, which integrates the nerve regenerative potential of microRNA&#8208;22 and tFNAs to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by improving the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages. MiDs can rapidly initiate the repair procedures of SCs and facilitate the polarization of macrophages into M2 macrophages to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, an innovative approach is adopted to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, which can integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrate that MiDs can amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs can initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

         <title>A Unique Fe&#8211;N4 Coordination System Enabling Transformation of Oxygen into Superoxide for Photocatalytic C&#63743;H Activation with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. In this work, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride, that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C&#63743;H bonds is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. However, activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low&#8208;spin Fe&#8211;N4&#160;system (t2g6eg0) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O2, producing O2&#8226;&#8722;. The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O2&#8226;&#8722; ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C&#63743;H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) is used as node to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs for the first time. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultra&#8208;Flexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Bio&#8208;Signal Detection</title>

Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultra&#8208;flexible electronics. Thus, we design an ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;organic photodetectors (all&#8208;OPD) by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied ITO/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA/W among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20000 circles, which can output steady bio&#8208;signals for photoplethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. Our work offers a new avenue towards developing a multifunctional and ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

         <title>Blading of Conformal Electron Transport Layers in p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process, however it has not been demonstrated yet to fabricate all the active layers in perovskite modules using scalable solution process. Herein, we report the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions with all layers bladed except the metal electrode by overcoming the challenges of blading of 36&#177;9&#160;nm&#160;thick electron transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8764;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows PCBM to conformally cover perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM molecules and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by small amine functionalized molecules. Perovskite solar cells (0.08 cm2) fabricated by all blading process have reached an average efficiency of &#8764;22.4&#177;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL solar cells. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule with an area of 25.03 cm2 shows an aperture efficiency of &#8764;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolytes: Underexplored Materials for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality is assessed. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of Free&#8208;Standing Flexible 2D Intercalated Nanofilm Uniform over Tens of cm2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported. The film can be laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The film is uniform over an area of 30 cm2, and shows electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending and proton conductivity up to 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Of a variety of intercalated materials, 2D intercalated systems have attracted much attention both as materials per se, and as a platform to study atoms and molecules confined among nanometric layers. High&#8208;precision fabrication of such structures has, however, been a difficult task using the conventional top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported here. The two&#8208;layered film can be further laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The 3 nm film forms uniformly over an area of several tens of cm2 at an air/water interface and can be transferred to either flat or perforated substrates. A free&#8208;standing film in air prepared by transfer to a gold comb electrode shows proton conductivity up to 1.4&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. Electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending of a free&#8208;standing 6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm hung in a vacuum is observed under electron beam irradiation.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution (1271 dpi), and layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.








Abstract
2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large&#8208;area and high&#8208;throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high&#8208;resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate&#8208; and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high&#8208;resolution and controllable molecular&#8208;layer numbers through solution&#8208;based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;step strategy to produce high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large&#8208;scale 2DOSCs with well&#8208;defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays&#8208;based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility. This strategy can be applied to various organic semiconductors and pattern arrays. These demonstrations will offer more opportunities for 2DOSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable All&#8208;Fluorescent White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a High External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% and Extended Device Lifetime</title>

Color&#8208;tunable white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with hole&#8208;trapping thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.








Abstract
White organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer device architecture capable of hole&#8208;trapping TADF&#8208;sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll&#8208;off. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This is the first time that all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.

&lt;p&gt;Color-tunable white organic light-emitting diodes with hole-trapping thermally activated delayed-fluorescence-sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed-fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double-emissive-layer device architecture capable of hole-trapping TADF-sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll-off. The proof-of-concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &amp;gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the first time that all-fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

Conformal Films
In article number 2106683, Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a variety of ultrathin, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics that differ in layout, active area, and active material can be laminated to glass spheres of different sizes using a thermally activated shrink film. The wrinkling pattern that occurs in these ultrathin sheets allows even nonstretchable devices to conform to surfaces with a 3D curvature.

         <title>Controlled Growth and Self&#8208;Assembly of Multiscale Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

&lt;p&gt;This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light-emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure-enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <title>Recent Progress in External&#8208;Stimulus&#8208;Responsive 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Influence of Oxidation on Structure, Performance, and Application of Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research concerning metallic glass oxidation is reviewed by summarizing metallic glass oxidation behaviors, how oxidation influences metallic glass structure and performance, and the possibilities and the feasibility of using controlled oxidation to reinforce metallic glasses or develop metallic glass systems.








Abstract

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;Doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions is designed by integrating Co&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles with highly crystalline poly(triazine imide), of which the surface Co&#8208;embedded CeCo conjunction features functionalized Co species toward the boosted directional electron&#8208;driving effect from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, thus promoting electronic transferability for multiple electrons&#8208;involving CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction.








Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involving reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction, is reported. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, this study identifies that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating the driving of electrons from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involving CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8211;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential toward targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

         <title>Perception&#8208;to&#8208;cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial intelligence&#8208;motivated Human full&#8208;skin Bionic Electronic Skin</title>

Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, we propose an AI&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8208;34&#160;kPa), fast response/recovery time (&lt;5.6&#160;ms) and limit of detection (0.05&#160;Pa). In addition, it is also demonstrated it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. Firstly, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Secondly, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis and a 5&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of FSB e&#8208;skin with a 6&#8208;layer MLP neural network, we develop an advanced intelligent material cognition system for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Diammonium mediated perovskite film formation for high&#8208;luminescence red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mixed halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here we explored the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite films. We found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8208;Br, rather than Pb&#8208;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. We propose that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8211;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Designing rewritable dual&#8208;mode patterns using a stretchable photoresponsive polymer via orthogonal photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photo&#8208;induced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. Our study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8211;OH Bonds in a Catalyst Facilitates the Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is a complex reaction including electrochemical step and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process. The interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects of Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS enable the activated Ni2+&#8211;OH to exhibit an excellent NOR activity. More importantly, spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps, including proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, hydration, and rearrangement, lead to diverse nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation pathways of different NOR systems.








Abstract
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, the nonuniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For the NOR, involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni2+&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Visualizing Atomically Layered Magnetism in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a layered material possessing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at low temperatures (T&#160;&lt;&#160;132&#160;K). At higher temperatures or in the presence of modest magnetic fields, AFM correlations are suppressed, yielding a magnetic phase with a comparatively high sheet susceptibility (&#967;2D). Magnetic force microscopy is sensitive to &#967;2D and identifies local nanoscale magnetic ordering.








Abstract
2D materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8211;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8776;16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, we developed a distinct approach for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirmed the successful creation of high quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodepostion with lithographic patterning. We further fabricated FETs on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and confirmed that these junctions exhibited reduced contact barrier of &#8764;20 meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290 &#937;&#183;&#956;m and thus increased the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8764;108 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. Our approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Cell&#8208;in&#8208;Catalytic&#8208;Shell Nanoarchitectonics: Catalytic Empowerment of Individual Living Cells by Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, up to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with supramolecular metal&#8208;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids, and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. Our system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Self&#8208;healing of Metal Oxides Assisted By Polymer&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here we have developed a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein we demonstrate that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials has been expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. We revealed that electrical properties of ITO can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here we report a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design, where red phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red P/VAG) assemblies. Such electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion transport nanochannels and electron transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8211;2), which was the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell showed stable cycling with high energy density (405&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, 1040&#160;Wh L&#8211;1), and power density (1224 W kg&#8211;1 and 3137 W L&#8211;1 at 6 C, 30&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). Such single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design with inner vertical charge transport pathways can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. Here, an asymmetrically&#8208;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultra&#8208;high stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially&#8208;stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperforms the ultrahigh stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices towards a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#8212;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience and nanotechnology. Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, we report an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy to manipulating mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09 A mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes the C&#8212;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%. The findings in this work may put forward new insight into producing a new family of 2D and/or mesoporous metals with fascinating physicochemical properties for various targeted applications.

         <title>Biaxially Compressive Strain in Ni/Ru Core/Shell Nanoplates Boosts Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in the rechargeable Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8764;5.1% and &#8764;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8208;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. We demonstrate that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8211;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8211;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. Our study confirms that strain engineering though constructing the well&#8208;defined core/shell structure is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited to mostly antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here we report a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform enabling screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, &#945;&#8208;Man, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, and &#946;&#8208;GalNAc) was converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). We systematically screened and identified GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;Man and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc showed selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, and &#945;&#8208;Man demonstrated targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrated that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggested its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>

Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multi&#8208;material and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, we report a SHrinkage&#8208;Assisted Patterning by Evaporation (SHAPE) method, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong inter&#8208;layer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless microsupercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functioned stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, this paper highlights recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging have been discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive, and real&#8208;time detection, IR spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough application perspectives for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far&#8208;field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot&#8208;spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroscopy, we showcase a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, we will highlight some advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided analysis.

         <title>Carrier Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we use operando photoemission electron microscopy to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during the transistor operation. Notably, we observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer showed that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by approximately 80%. Our technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extreme strain induced by nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Graphene is known as a super&#8208;stiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, we report the Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool. Nanoindentation was performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light was focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signal of the G and 2D bands of graphene was redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. Our measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under super&#8208;high strain.

         <title>Semi&#8208;immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics towards Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively investigated as next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries due to their advantages including high theoretical capacity, reliable safety, environment friendly, and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of zinc ion batteries. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode in a wide temperature range from &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition, the free anions of ILs can weaken hydrogen bonds of water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries has been greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000 h under a wide temperature window from &#8208;35&#176;C&#8764;60&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy has been well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20 A g&#8211;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80000 cycles. This work provides a new platform for constructing stable Zn anode and high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Ultrafast sintering for ceramic&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>

Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, we report an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds. Furthermore, it is also able to integrate electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer based solid devices.

         <title>Recent progress of metal sulfide photocatalysts for solar energy conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. In this review, we describe how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides and envision future development trends in photocatalysis.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. In this work, we identify that previous studies were constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micron helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here we isolate ChNCs from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, we perform an in situ alkaline treatment, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over suspension formulation, we demonstrate structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>

Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel were fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor was integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS have provided a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, lithium metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

         <title>Emerging Solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Harvesting, Storage and Utilization</title>

Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8208;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8208;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention towards practical thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, we aim to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8208;solid PCMs suitable for thermal energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. We start by presenting developing strategies of solid&#8208;solid PCMs and then discuss the structure&#8208;property relationship followed by potential applications. We finish by presenting an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions. We hope our efforts will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic and mechanical applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, it is still a grand challenge to achieve single&#8208;phase MEAAs using current synthetic methods. Herein, we report a general strategy for the preparation of ultralight three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials and a very high porosity of 99.5% through combining the auto&#8208;combustion method and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies reveal that the highly selective CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free conversion of methanol to formate over MEAA catalysts. We also demonstrate that the methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 173&#160;mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, and obtain value&#8208;added formate at anode to realize the sustainable H2 generation at cathode. This work lays the foundation for the design of advanced 3D MEAAs and broadens the electrocatalytic application of multimetallic MEAAs.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked of Multilayer and Weakly Bond Lowering Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling of lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding and lattice dynamics. Herein, we demonstrated a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inversed GaSe4 layers (g&#8217;), closed&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c&#8217;) along the c axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding arrange in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endue it a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.79 W/m/K at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W/m/K), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W/m/K), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W/m/K) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, also shed useful light on future design of low lattice thermal conductivity solids.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with adaptive adhesion and stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8208;liquid stability and adhesion when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, we imaged the liquid impalement dynamics in three dimensions by confocal microscope and measured the stability and superhydrophobicity in varied systems. We envision our design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability could stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but &#8764;5 times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Interface Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Here we report a facile approach to transform a RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by Mo&#8208;irradiation doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, we unveil a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating Mo irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device could achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. Our findings manifest the potential for modulating resistive switching in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Morphology Tuned Pt3Ge Accelerates Water Dissociation to Industrial Standard Hydrogen Production over a wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. We introduce a novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 mA/cm2 and 200 mA/cm2 current density, respectively in 0.5M H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15,000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA/cm2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displayed low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA/cm2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA/cm2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites and charge transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, we elucidate a crystallization mechanism. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221;, multi&#8208;step process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. We here report for the first time the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultra&#8208;high reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. Our approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances, low power consumption as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices in batches are discussed. Reports on 2D material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM), static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM), and Flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, which are mostly focused on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, we review the major challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D material&#8208;based memory, and also give perspectives on possible approaches towards a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication, hopefully shedding some light on future research in this field.

         <title>Multichannel superposition of grafted perfect vortex beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting; grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently; grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However; the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system; hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here; we propose and demonstrate a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. For the first time; a single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels; leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. Our work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics; opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II photothermally triggered &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; for hypoxic tumor programmed cascade therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hypoxia as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) was reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods (AuNRs) with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of a polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2 release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Firstly, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2 infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is executed to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy would provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.

         <title>Construction of N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames anchored with Fe single atoms and Fe2P nanoparticles as robust coupling catalyst for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance and high atomic economy electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and investigation of the related catalytic mechanism are of crucial importance yet such tasks are still challenging. Herein, we synthesized a highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) coupling catalyst by a novel in situ&#8208;doping&#8208;adsorption&#8208;phosphatization strategy for electrocatalytic ORR. The Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity with high E1/2 of 0.78 and 0.91&#160;V, low Tafel slope of 63.8 and 45.4 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1, and large JK of 2.46 and 14.47 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 0.8 and 0.85&#160;V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, which surpasses most of the non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, and is comparable to that of Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal a synergistic effect that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability would elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms in Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, which serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicated that the atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/Fe&#8211;P coupled active centers in Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst is characteristic of different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the Fe&#8211;P site as an active site for the O2 adsorption&#8211;activation process, which is beneficial to the formation of P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, and the O&#8211;H bond in P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* can cleave to form spillover H species, which can in turn combine with another N4&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, accelerating the ORR progress. By contrast, in 0.1 M KOH, the Fe&#8211;P sites are not involved in the ORR process, but the doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of the Fe&#8211;N4 center, thereby improving the ORR activity. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium tellurides is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect. Our results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. Our study enables on&#8208;chip integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid-infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid-infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on type-II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium tellurides is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect. Our results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid-infrared region of TaIrTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. Our study enables on-chip integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM-sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid-infrared region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultra&#8208;broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, we demonstrate a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3,906 S&#183;cm&#8211;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8764;0.14 emu / g under 300 k), thus attaining the synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8764;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configurating &#8764;20&#160;nm thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. Our work enables a potential for developing an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation and stealthy technologies.

         <title>Metamaterial Absorbers: from Tunable Surface to Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs has been significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwave to optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into MAs design allows the dynamically manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push the breakthrough in metadevices. In last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. In this review, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is revisited, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, we call back two additional approaches including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed, are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 D and 3.39 D respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility, which explains the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Engineering kesterite based photocathode for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrated selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS). The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% faradaic efficiency (0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V versus RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8211; and *NO2 intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8211; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Our further attempted PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater shows good faradaic efficiency of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using kesterite based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are fabricated, NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8208;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3) with an optimized Co/Ni ratio 1:1 exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according with the DFT theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes, provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy storage field.

&lt;p&gt;Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel-based metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF-74 family in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping M&lt;sup&gt;x+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in Ni-MOF-74 are fabricated, NiM-MOF@CC (M = Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), and NiCoM-MOF@CC (M = Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni-based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel-zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as-prepared electrodes, NiCo-MOF@CC-3 (NCM@CC-3) with an optimized Co/Ni ratio 1:1 exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according with the DFT theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC-3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder-free electrodes, provides a new direction for the synthesis of high-performance materials in the energy storage field.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>

Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials; acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here; we propose a new hardening effect associated with the isolated oxygen vacancy for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances. Guided by theoretical design; a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics; where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging; hysteresis measurement; and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis; we reveal that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the retainment of polarization contributes. More encouragingly; the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity; offering the potential in material designing for practical high&#8208;power applications; such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotome.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Employing Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium metal battery (PMB). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between potassium and planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and hence undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, we propose a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY) modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties that simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#956;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#956;g cm&#8208;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed by Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Machine Learning on a Robotic Platform for the Design of Polymer&#8208;Protein Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polymer&#8208;protein hybrids are intriguing materials that can bolster protein stability in non&#8208;native environments, thereby enhancing their utility in diverse medicinal, commercial, and industrial applications. One stabilization strategy involves designing synthetic random copolymers with compositions attuned to the protein surface, but rational design is complicated by a vast chemical and composition space. Here, a strategy is reported to design protein&#8208;stabilizing copolymers based on active machine learning, facilitated by automated material synthesis and characterization platforms. The versatility and robustness of the approach is demonstrated by the successful identification of copolymers that preserve, or even enhance, the activity of three chemically distinct enzymes following exposure to thermal denaturing conditions. Although systematic screening results in mixed success, active learning appropriately identifies unique and effective copolymer chemistries for the stabilization of each enzyme. Overall, this work broadens our&#160;capabilities to design fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose synthetic copolymers that promote or otherwise manipulate protein activity, with extensions towards the design of robust polymer&#8208;protein hybrid&#160;materials.
