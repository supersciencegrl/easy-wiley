         <title>Inhibiting Endothelial Cell&#8208;Mediated T Lymphocyte Apoptosis with Integrin&#8208;Targeting Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Filaments for Chemoimmunotherapy of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs) limit anti&#8208;tumor immunity via inducing apoptosis of infiltrating T lymphocytes through a Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;mediated mechanism. Herein, we create a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) by linking 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) to hydrophilic segments with either RGDR or HKD motif at their C&#8208;terminus through a glutathione&#8208;responsive linker. The PDCs spontaneously assemble into filaments in aqueous solution. The PDC filaments containing 1% of SN38&#8208;RGDR (SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR) effectively target triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and TECs with upregulated expression of integrin, and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and FasL down&#8208;regulation of TECs. SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR increases infiltration, activity, and viability of CD8+ T cells, and thus inhibits the growth of primary tumors and pulmonary metastasis. This study highlights the synergistic modulation of cancerous cells and TECs with integrin&#8208;targeting PDC filaments as a promising strategy for TNBC chemoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells Using Triple&#8208;Doped Bismuth Oxides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the great potential of solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) as highly efficient energy conversion devices, the undesirable high operating temperature has limited their wider applicability. Herein, a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature SOCs (LT&#8208;SOCs) is presented through the use of an Er, Y, and Zr triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxide (EYZB). This study demonstrates that EYZB exhibits &gt;147 times higher ionic conductivity of 0.44 S/cm at 600&#176;C compared to commercial Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia electrolyte with excellent stability over 1000&#160;h. By rationally incorporating EYZB in composite electrodes and bilayer electrolytes, the zirconia&#8208;based electrolyte LT&#8208;SOC achieves the unprecedentedly high performance of 3.45 and 2.02&#160;W/cm2 in the fuel cell mode and 2.08 and 0.95 A/cm2 in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 and 600&#176;C, respectively. Further, a distinctive microstructural feature of EYZB that largely extends triple phase boundary at the interface is revealed through digital twinning. This work provides insights for developing high&#8208;performance LT&#8208;SOCs.

         <title>Strain Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation was developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#8208;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

         <title>Spatially Selective Solvation Structure by Electronegative Micro&#8208;Arrays for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For electrolytes with conventional lithium salt concentration, it is not easy to generate sufficient anion&#8208;derived beneficial inorganic components to stabilize the electrolyte&#8208;lithium metal anode interface due to the repulsion of the free state anions by the anode. In this study, we solve the above issues through the strong interaction between electronegative materials and lithium ions (Li+). A locally high Li+ concentration strategy is proposed by preparing micro&#8208;arrays of electronegative nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) on the Cu foil. It is found that the O atoms in &#8208;PO4 functional groups of the nHA can strongly adsorb Li+ to form locally Li+&#8208;rich region, which increases the probability of anions to interact with Li+. The formation of more Li+&#8208;coordinated anions at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface can reduce the Li+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier, and enable the anions to completely decompose into lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium nitride (Li3N) on Li metal anode. The interfacial transfer dynamics is accelerated and the Li dendrites are effectively suppressed. Under high current density, the anode exhibits long lifespan with high Coulombic efficiency and small polarization voltage. The nHA micro&#8208;arrays achieve the targeted solvation structure at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, while ensuring conventional lithium salt concentration in the bulk electrolyte.

         <title>Control of Mechanical and Fracture Properties in Two&#8208;Phase Materials Reinforced by Continuous, Irregular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, we study the fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of the topology of their irregular microstructures. We use a stochastic algorithm to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, we tailor the mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites, at the local and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a spatially determined meso&#8208;scale assembly, we demonstrate how the spatial propagation of fractures in architected composite materials can be designed and controlled a priori.

Abstract
Chronic wounds have become a significant threat to people's physical and mental health and have increased the burden of social medical care. Intelligent wound dressing (IWD) with wound condition monitoring and closed&#8208;loop on&#8208;demand drug therapy can shorten the healing process and alleviate patient suffering. However, single&#8208;function wound dressings cannot meet the current needs of chronic wound treatment. Here, a wearable IWD consisting of wound exudate management, sensor monitoring, closed&#8208;loop therapy, and flexible circuit modules is reported, which can achieve effective synergy between wound exudate management and on&#8208;demand wound therapy. The dressing is attached to the wound site, and the wound exudate is spontaneously pumped into the microfluidic channel for storage. Meanwhile, the IWD can detect the state of the wound through the temperature and humidity sensor, and use this as feedback to control the liquid metal (LM) heater through a smartphone, thereby realizing the on&#8208;demand drug release from the hydrogel. In a mouse model of infected wounds, IWD accelerates wound healing by reducing inflammatory responses, promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition.

         <title>Insights into the Si&#9472;H Bonding Configuration at the Amorphous/Crystalline Silicon Interface of Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells by Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that Raman spectroscopy can be used to investigate the silicon&#8208;hydrogen (Si&#9472;H) bonding configuration of thinhydrogenated amorphous silicon layers directly on silicon heterojunction solar cells. Additionally, a detailed comparison of the Si&#8211;H vibrational spectra near the amorphous/crystalline silicon interface measured by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy is performed.








Abstract
In silicon heterojunction solar cell technology, thin layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) are applied as passivating contacts to the crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) wafer. Thus, the properties of the a&#8208;Si:H is crucial for the performance of the solar cells. One important property of a&#8208;Si:H is its microstructure which can be characterized by the microstructure parameter R based on Si&#9472;H bond stretching vibrations. A common method to determine R is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption measurement which, however, is difficult to perform on solar cells for various reasons like the use of textured Si wafers and the presence of conducting oxide contact layers. Here, it is demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy is suitable to determine the microstructure of bulk a&#8208;Si:H layers of 10&#160;nm or less on textured c&#8208;Si underneath indium tin oxide as conducting oxide. A detailed comparison of FTIR and Raman spectra is performed and significant differences in the microstructure parameter are obtained by both methods with decreasing a&#8208;Si:H film thickness.

         <title>Application of Conductive MOF in Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of applications in modern society as a high&#8208;performance organic material. Conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) have superior electrical conductivity compared with pristine MOFs, and thus can further improve the performance of Zn&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
The use of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) in zinc&#8208;based batteries has been a popular research direction. Zinc&#8208;based batteries are widely used with the advantages of high specific capacity and safety and stability, but they also face many problems. c&#8208;MOFs have excellent conductivity compared with other primitive MOFs, and therefore have better applications in zinc&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, the transfer mechanisms of the unique charges of c&#8208;MOFs: hop transport and band transport, respectively, are discussed and the way of electron transport is further addressed. Then, the various ways to prepare c&#8208;MOFs are introduced, among which solvothermal, interfacial synthesis, and postprocessing methods are widely used. In addition, the applications of c&#8208;MOFs are discussed in terms of their role and performance in different types of zinc&#8208;based batteries. Finally, the current problems of c&#8208;MOFs and the prospects for their future development are presented.

         <title>A Functional Janus Ag Nanowires/Bacterial Cellulose Separator for High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin Janus separator composed of Ag nanowires and bacterial cellulose is designed for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;metal batteries. This Janus separator with abundant zincophilic sites, uniform&#8208;distributed electric/thermal field, and enhanced ion transport kinetics can help to realize the stable cycle life over 1000 h under 80 mA cm&#8722;2 and sustain over 600 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer promising prospects for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent abundance and safety features. However, the growth of zinc dendrites remains a primary obstacle to the practical industrialization of AZIBs, especially under harsh conditions of high current densities and elevated temperatures. To address this issue, a Janus separator with an exceptionally ultrathin thickness of 29&#160;&#181;m is developed. This Janus separator features the bacterial cellulose (BC) layer on one side and Ag nanowires/bacterial cellulose (AgNWs/BC) layer on the other side. High zincophilic property and excellent electric/thermal conductivity of AgNWs make them ideal for serving as an ion pump to accelerate Zn2+ transport in the electrolyte, resulting in greatly improved Zn2+ conductivity, deposition of homogeneous Zn nuclei, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn. Consequently, the Zn||Zn symmetrical cells with the Janus separator exhibit a stable cycle life of over 1000 h under 80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and are sustained for over 600 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C. Further, the Janus separator enables excellent cycling stability in AZIBs, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (AZICs), and scaled&#8208;up flexible soft&#8208;packaged batteries. This study demonstrates the potential of functional separators in promoting the application of aqueous zinc batteries, particularly under harsh conditions.

         <title>An Ultrafast Air Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self&#8208;charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O2. Herein, we designed an ultrafast air self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery by constructing a PANI@Pt/C composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O2 with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self&#8208;charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self&#8208;charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O2 simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self&#8208;charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air self-charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self-charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we designed an ultrafast air self-charging aqueous zinc battery by constructing a PANI@Pt/C composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self-charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self-charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self-charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, flexible soft-packaged Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries were fabricated and displayed stable electrochemical performance and self-rechargeability even at different bending states. This work provides a route to design ultrafast chemical self-charging energy storage devices and broadens the horizons of flexible energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual&#8208;effect Coupling for Superior Dielectric and Thermal Conductivity of Polyimide Composite Films Featuring &#8220;Crystal&#8208;like Phase&#8221; Structure</title>

Abstract
To match the increasing miniaturization and integration of electronic devices, higher requirements are put on the dielectric and thermal properties of the dielectrics to overcome the problems of delayed signal transmission and heat accumulation. Here, a 3D thermal conductivity network has been successfully constructed inside the PI matrix by the combination of ionic liquids (IL) and calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanofillers, motivated by the bubble&#8208;hole forming orientation force. Benefiting from the 3D thermal network formed by IL as a porogenic template and &#8220;crystal&#8208;like phase&#8221; structures induced by CaF2&#8208; polyamide acid charge transfer, IL&#8208;10 vol% CaF2/PI porous film exhibits a low permittivity of 2.14 and a thermal conductivity of 7.22 W&#8729;m&#8722;1&#8729;K&#8722;1. This design strategy breaks the bottleneck that low permittivity and high thermal conductivity in microelectronic systems are difficult to be jointly controlled, and provides a feasible solution for the development of intelligent microelectronics.

         <title>Micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano Oncolytic Microbial System Shifts from Tumor Killing to Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes Remolding for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Because the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) microenvironment is commonly immunosuppressive, oncolytic microbe&#8208;induced tumor antigens aren't sufficiently cross&#8208;primed tumor specific T cells through antigen&#8208;presenting cells (e.g., DCs) in TDLNs. Herein, we developed the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial therapeutics based on pyranose oxidase (P2O)&#8208;overexpressed Escherichia coli (EcP) which were simultaneously encapsulated by PEGylated mannose and low&#8208;concentrated photosensitizer nanoparticles. Following administration, P2O from this system generated toxic hydrogen peroxide for tumor regression and led to the release of tumor antigens. The &#8220;microscale&#8221; EcP was triggered, following exposure to the laser irradiation, to secret the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs significantly regulated the TDLNs immuno&#8208;microenvironment, promoting the maturation of DCs to potentiate tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cells immune response. The micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbe was leveraged to exert tumor killing and remold TDLNs for initiating potent activation of DCs, providing promising strategies to facilitate microbial cancer vaccination.

         <title>Microfluidic Platforms for Real&#8208;Time in Situ Monitoring of Biomarkers for Cellular Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cellular processes are mechanisms carried out at the cellular level (within or among more than one cell interactions) that are aimed at guaranteeing the stability of the organism they comprise. The investigation of cellular processes is key to understanding cell fate, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and developing new therapeutic technologies. Microfluidic platforms are thought to be the most powerful tools among all methodologies for investigating cellular processes because they can integrate almost all types of the existing intracellular and extracellular biomarker&#8208;sensing methods and observation approaches for cell behavior, combined with precisely controlled cell culture, manipulation, stimulation, and analysis. Most importantly, microfluidic platforms can realize real&#8208;time in situ detection of secreted proteins, exosomes, and other biomarkers produced during cell physiological processes (adhesion, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication), thereby providing the possibility to draw the whole picture for a cellular process. In addition, these can be used to study the process of cell or tissue response to changes in the microenvironment (drugs, physical signals, or types and quantities of surrounding cells). Owing to their advantages of high throughput, low sample consumption, and precise cell control, microfluidic platforms with real&#8208;time in situ monitoring characteristics are widely being used in cell analysis (cellular heterogeneity analysis, cell sorting, and cellular marker detection), disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, and biological production. This review focuses on the basic concepts, recent progress, and application prospects of microfluidic platforms for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes.

         <title>A Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Biomacromolecule Film for Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Side reactions on zinc metal anodes are formidable issues that cause limited battery life of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, we deploy a facile and controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly technique to construct an ion&#8208;conductive and mechanically robust electrolyte/anode interface for stabilizing the Zn anode. The LbL film consists of two natural and biodegradable biomacromolecules, chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA). We show that such an LbL film tailors the solvation sheath of Zn ions and facilitates the oriented deposition of Zn. Symmetric cells with the four double layers of CS/SA ((CS/SA)4&#8208;Zn) exhibit stable cycles for over 5200&#160;h. The (CS/SA)4&#8208;Zn||H2V3O8 coin cell maintains a specific capacity of 125.5 mAh&#8729;g&#8722;1 after 14000 cycles. The pouch cell with an electrode area of 5&#215;7 cm2 also presents a capacity retention of 83% for over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. No obvious dendrites are observed after long cycles in both symmetric and full cells. Given the cost&#8208;effective material and fabrication, and environmental friendliness of the LbL films, this Zn protection strategy may boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>Hybrid Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Silver Selenide&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning leveraging literature data and actively collected experimental data can speed up optimizing new AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The approach considers five different chemical elements, and with only seven rounds of active experimentation guided by Bayesian optimization, a 75% improvement in power factor is achieved, resulting in one of the best values in this material class (2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2).








Abstract
Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, a hybrid data&#8208;driven strategy that integrates Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Data is collected from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe&#8208;based materials prepared using a simple high&#8208;throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag2Se1). The success of this study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Based on Fluid Medium: From Fundamental Mechanisms toward Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are at the forefront of promising energy technologies, demonstrating the ability to generate electricity through the dynamic interaction between two dissimilar materials, wherein at least one is a fluidic medium (such as gas or liquid). By capitalizing on the dynamic and continuous properties of fluids and their interface interactions, FB&#8208;TENGs exhibit a larger effective contact area and a longer&#8208;lasting triboelectric effect in comparison to their solid&#8208;based counterparts, thereby affording longer&#8208;term energy harvesting and higher&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in harsh conditions. In this review, various fluid&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs, have been systematically summarized. Their working mechanism, optimization strategies, respective advantages and applications, theoretical and simulation analysis, as well as the existing challenges, have also been comprehensively discussed, which provide prospective directions for device design and mechanism understanding of FB&#8208;TENGs.

         <title>Piezoelectricity, Pyroelectricity and Ferroelectricity in Biomaterials and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric materials are considered unique biomedical materials due to their dielectric crystals and asymmetric centers that allow them to directly convert various primary forms of energy in the environment, such as sunlight, mechanical energy, and thermal energy, into secondary energy, such as electricity and chemical energy. These materials possess exceptional energy conversion ability and excellent catalytic properties, which have led to their widespread usage within biomedical fields. Numerous biomedical applications have demonstrated great potential with these materials, including disease treatment, biosensors, and tissue engineering. For example, piezoelectric materials have been used to stimulate cell growth in bone regeneration, while pyroelectric materials have been applied in skin cancer detection and imaging. Ferroelectric materials have even found use in neural implants that record and stimulate electrical activity in the brain. This paper reviews the relationship between ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric effects and the fundamental principles of different catalytic reactions. It also highlights the preparation methods of these three materials and the significant progress made in their biomedical applications. The review concludes by presenting key challenges and future prospects for efficient catalysts based on piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Flexible Electrodes for Brain&#8211;Computer Interface System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brain projects around the world, the classification of electrical neural signals, the applications of brain&#8211;computer interface, drawbacks of rigid electrodes, and the necessity to switch to flexible electrodes, are briefly introduced in this article. Then the classification of different type of electrodes, electrode materials, fabrication methods, flexible substrates, and extra requirements for flexible electrodes have been systematically reviewed.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interface (BCI) has been the subject of extensive research recently. Governments and companies have substantially invested in relevant research and applications. The restoration of communication and motor function, the treatment of psychological disorders, gaming, and other daily and therapeutic applications all benefit from BCI. The electrodes hold the key to the essential, fundamental BCI precondition of electrical brain activity detection and delivery. However, the traditional rigid electrodes are limited due to their mismatch in Young's modulus, potential damages to the human body, and a decline in signal quality with time. These factors make the development of flexible electrodes vital and urgent. Flexible electrodes made of soft materials have grown in popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional rigid electrodes because they offer greater conformance, the potential for higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR)&#160;signals, and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the latest classifications and future developmental directions of fabricating these flexible electrodes are explored in this paper to further encourage the speedy advent of flexible electrodes for BCI. In summary, the perspectives and future outlook for this developing discipline are provided.

         <title>Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in 2D Weyl Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation performance (better than the visible region) is demonstrated in the newly discovered Weyl semiconductor &#8722;2D Te. Theoretical calculations reveal that it originated from the large Berry curvature dipole near the Weyl points of 2D Te. Therefore, even excited by continuous&#8208;wave laser, strong sum&#8208;frequency generation can be obtained in 2D Te.








Abstract
Due to its inversion&#8208;broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, 2D Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh second&#8208;harmonic generation response is acquired from 2D Te with a large second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&#967;(2)), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS2 in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &#967;(2) of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm&#160;V&#8722;1 at &#8776;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &#967;(2) of 2D Te also enables the high&#8208;intensity sum&#8208;frequency generation with an ultralow continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Switching Memristor&#8208;Based Compute&#8208;In&#8208;Memory Module for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory module integrated with bulk&#8208;switching memristor arrays is demonstrated. A hardware&#8211;software co&#8208;designed system is constructed to accelerate the neural network training and relax stringent requirements for device precision and endurance. The on&#8208;chip trained networks are able to reach software&#8208;comparable accuracies and exhibit robustness to weight perturbation when transferred to a new chip.








Abstract
The constant drive to achieve higher performance in deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to the proliferation of very large models. Model training, however, requires intensive computation time and energy. Memristor&#8208;based compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) modules can perform vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) in place and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM&#8208;based model training faces challenges due to non&#8208;linear weight updates, device variations, and low&#8208;precision. In this work, a mixed&#8208;precision training scheme is experimentally implemented to mitigate these effects using a bulk&#8208;switching memristor&#8208;based CIM module. Low&#8208;precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high&#8208;precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre&#8208;defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system&#8208;onchip of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub&#8208;systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and verifies that CIM modules can enable efficient mix&#8208;precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full&#8208;precision software&#8208;trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re&#8208;training.

         <dc:description>
Dihydroethidium (DHE)&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem (DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE) is introduced for ultrasound&#8208;driven tumor therapy. Under medical ultrasound, it produces cytotoxic ethidium and reactive oxygen species. DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE induces ferroptosis via glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and glutathione peroxidase 4 reduction. Furthermore, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE NPs not only exhibits effective ultrasound&#8208;active therapy of solid tumors but also downregulate the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins, inhibiting lung metastasis.








Abstract
Ultrasound, featuring deep tissue penetration and noninvasiveness, offers a new opportunity to activate functional materials in a tumor&#8208;selective manner. However, very few direct ultrasound&#8208;responsive redox systems are applicable under therapeutic ultrasound (1&#160;MHz). Herein, the investigations on nanoprodrug of DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE are reported, which exhibit glutathione&#8208;activated release of dihydroethidium (DHE) in tumor cells. DHE is stable with good biosafety and is transformed into cytotoxic ethidium to induce DNA damage under medical ultrasound irradiation, accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Further, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE could effectively induce ferroptosis through glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. In vivo studies confirmed that DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE nanoparticles effectively inhibit both the growth of solid tumors and the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins in mice, thus effectively inhibiting lung metastasis. This DHE&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem could lay a foundation for the design of ultrasound&#8208;driven therapeutic agents.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based 3D Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic colloidal glasses with isotropic structural color can be shaped into complex objects by light&#8208;based 3D printing and calcination. Printed and calcined parts rely on sustainable, non&#8208;bleaching colloidal particles for color formation, making them an attractive alternative to traditional pigments in applications such as security features, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of sub&#8208;micrometer particles. While films, droplets, and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into 3D objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment is reported. Rheology, photopolymerization, and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering, and optical characterization, it is shown that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating 3D objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Bright Heptamethine Dye Clusters Based on a Self&#8208;Adaptive Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy for NIR&#8208;IIb Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy, FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence which enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can also occur in situ between IPA&#8208;FlavP2000/FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD).








Abstract
Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR&#8208;II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, a new set of Flav dyes is synthesized and PEGylated, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP2000 nanoparticles using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence (&#8776;44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP2000 enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can occur in situ between FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP2000 in blood or serum. The self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; BAD is successfully applied to long&#8208;term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.

         <title>A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in the Alloy and Metallic Plating Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying rationales that govern the rate&#8208;determining Li+ mass&#8208;transfer kinetics are comprehensively investigated across multiple scales, from the bulk solution, the faradic reaction at the interface to the solid&#8208;state diffusion. This study provides insights of thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetics competitive processes, which facilitates innovation of the high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.









Abstract
Li&#8208;containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li+ storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy&#8208;induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non&#8208;equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li&#8208;Zn alloy are comprehensively investigated as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real&#8208;time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in&#8208;depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate&#8208;limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

         <dc:description>
This work presents an unconventional heteroepitaxial growth strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance flexible and freestanding thermoelectric film with ordered and uniform microstructures. The integrated micro&#8208;thermoelectric module based on the above films exhibits excellent energy harvesting and cooling performance, validating the potential of freestanding thermoelectric films for thermal energy efficient harvesting and management.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal management. However, a high&#8208;performance flexible micro&#8208;thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed. Here a universal epitaxial growth strategy is reported guided by 1D van der Waals&#8208;coupling, to fabricate freestanding and flexible hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes and ordered (Bi,Sb)2Te3 nanocrystals. High power factors ranging from &#8776;1680 to &#8776;1020 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8211;480 K, combined with a low thermal conductivity yield a high average figure of merit of &#8776;0.81. The fabricated flexible micro&#8208;TED module consisting of two p&#8211;n couples of freestanding thermoelectric hybrids has an unprecedented open circuit voltage of &#8776;22.7 mV and a power density of &#8776;0.36 W cm&#8722;2 under &#8776;30 K temperature difference, and a net cooling temperature of &#8776;22.4 K and a heat absorption density of &#8776;92.5 W cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes in the interlayer and in&#8208;plane of PHI are synthesized through different synthesis pathways. Compared with the Cu atoms located within the PHI plane, the interlayer position of PHI is more conducive to photoelectron migration and O2 adsorption and activation, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics.








Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs is far from satisfactory. Here, a method is reported to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes are synthesized in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus is &#8776;100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10&#160;min of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2&#160;h of incubation.

         <title>Spatially Controlled UV Light Generation at Depth using Upconversion Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV light can trigger diverse photochemical reactions, yet it is extremely challenging to deliver these high&#8208;energy photons beyond the surface. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to tackle this issue. To demonstrate precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are deployed to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter deep within an aqueous solution.








Abstract
UV light can trigger a plethora of useful photochemical reactions for diverse applications, including photocatalysis, photopolymerization, and drug delivery. These applications typically require penetration of high&#8208;energy photons deep into materials, yet delivering these photons beyond the surface is extremely challenging due to absorption and scattering effects. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to circumvent this issue by generating high&#8208;energy photons from incident lower&#8208;energy photons. However, molecules that facilitate TTA&#8208;UC usually have poor water solubility, limiting their deployment in aqueous environments. To address this challenge, a nanoencapsulation method is leveraged to fabricate water&#8208;compatible UC micelles, enabling on&#8208;demand UV photon generation deep into materials. Two iridium&#8208;based complexes are presented for use as TTA&#8208;UC sensitizers with increased solubilities that facilitate the formation of highly emissive UV&#8208;upconverting micelles. Furthermore, this encapsulation method is shown to be generalizable to nineteen UV&#8208;emitting UC systems, accessing a range of upconverted UV emission profiles with wavelengths as low as 350&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are used to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter beyond the surface, revealing opportunities for spatially controlled manipulation deep into UV&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material classification is achieved by measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles through a novel sensing platform that combines impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. Polystyrene and soda&#8208;lime glass microparticles are successfully classified, while differentiating between healthy and fixed cells. This paves the way for targeted applications in environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical quality control.








Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, a sensing platform is built to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allows to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles&#8212;below 22&#160;&#181;m in diameter&#8212;with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, it is shown that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined with the advantages of conventional conjugated aromatic luminescence and macromolecular cluster luminescence, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction. The resulting transparent films exhibit color&#8208;tunable, excitation&#8208;dependent, and water stimulus&#8208;response afterglows, giving an impressive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms.








Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHP rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing process; and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Layer Hollow Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with High 1T&#8208;Phase Purity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic strategy for fabricating single&#8208;layer hollow structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with high 1T&#8208;phase purity is developed by selectively etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures. The obtained single&#8208;layer hollow structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and durable stability in hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single&#8208;layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, a scalable method is reported for the synthesis of single&#8208;layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T&#8208;phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures including SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WS2, and SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WSe2. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single&#8208;layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#9472;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single&#8208;layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production.

     alt="Engineering Single-Layer Hollow Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with High 1T-Phase Purity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general synthetic strategy for fabricating single-layer hollow structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with high 1T-phase purity is developed by selectively etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre-synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures. The obtained single-layer hollow structure of 1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and durable stability in hydrogen evolution reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single-layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, a scalable method is reported for the synthesis of single-layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T-phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre-synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures including SLHS-1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SLHS-1T-MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SLHS-1T-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and SLHS-1T-WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single-layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#9472;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single-layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS-1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. This work provides a way to manufacture advanced functional materials based on the single-layer hollow structures of 1T-TMDs and to expand their applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction platform helps prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with ultrahigh drug&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) that can be used for personalized anticancer therapy. According to the platform, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with a DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for medium&#8208;sized and large ovarian tumors. Moreover, aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for colon tumors.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) have exciting possibilities in targeted tumor therapy. However, in the existing ADC preparation processes, the random attachment of the payloads to the antigen&#8208;binding fragments (Fab) greatly increases the risk of disrupting its antigen recognition ability, while the drug&#8208;antibody ratio&#160;(DAR) is low, leading to a cumbersome preparation process and low drug delivery efficiency. Herein, poly(glutamic acid) is used to expand the number of drug binding sites, based on the &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; of azide and DBCO, and the high affinity of Fc&#8208;III&#8208;4C peptide to the crystalline fragment (Fc) of the monoclonal antibodies. Various antibody&#8208;polymer&#8208;drug conjugates are obtained with ultrahigh DAR using this organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction. Among them, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for both medium&#8208;sized and large SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian tumors, and aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for MC38 colon tumors. In summary, a universal platform is created to prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive ADCs with ultrahigh DAR, which can be used to develop precision medicine for personalized anticancer therapy.

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#9472;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;Long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;N interface is designed to ameliorate the utilization of active hydrogen for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction to suppress the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC harvests superb stability due to the dual reinforcement of the internal Fe2N and the external carbon layer. This catalyst exhibits trade&#8208;offs between the scale&#8208;up application and the nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrogen (N2) is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (toward a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8776;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8776;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contribute to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC shows excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift toward nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Water Activation in Solar&#8208;Powered Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding on theoretical analyses about vaporization enthalpy, general calculation, and characterization means related to solar&#8208;powered water evaporation and the mechanisms of water activation to reduce the enthalpy are outlined. Furthermore, the typical representative and milestone works in solar&#8208;powered vapor generation are summarized, aiming to provide a relatively complete development chain and introduce a faster insight into this direction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered vapor evaporation (SVG), based on the liquid&#8208;gas phase conversion concept using solar energy, has been given close attention as a promising technology to address the global water shortage. At molecular level, water molecules escaping from liquid water should overcome the attraction of the molecules on the liquid surface layer to evaporate. For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods is provided. Various water activation mechanisms are also outlined to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SVG are highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.

         <title>Outer Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Based Nanohybrids Target Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages to Enhance Trained Immunity&#8208;Related Vaccine&#8208;Generated Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) nanohybrids, as a trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine (TIrV), induce central and peripheral trained immunity that can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring and enhance trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine&#8208;generated antitumor activity. This TIrV&#160;targets tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces different antitumor mechanisms with or without CD8 T cell activation in two distinct tumor models.








Abstract
Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory&#8208;like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity&#8208;related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor&#8208;specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV&#8208;inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long&#8208;term training, and trained tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV&#8208;based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV&#8208;SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM&#8208;CSF) for exerting vaccine&#8208;enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;&#8208;Fc&#8208;assisted OMVs trigger TAM&#8208;mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase&#8208;accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV&#8208;mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM&#8208;hot and T cell&#8208;cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16&#8208;F10 tumor model (T cell&#8208;hot and TAM&#8208;cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV&#8208;based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.

Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV-mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM-hot and T cell-cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16-F10 tumor model (T cell-hot and TAM-cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV-based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular DNA And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. Bulk state&#8208;switching is shown to arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses.








Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. These time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. These results are modeled using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. This platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

         <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Photoclick Patterning of Extracellular Matrix for Spatially Controlled Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;free, Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based photopatterning platform is presented which enables the spatially defined modification of protein&#8208;based hydrogels with dienophile&#8208;bearing biomolecules. By utilizing commercially available maleimide&#8208;functionalized streptavidin and biotinylated species of interest, a robust mix&#8208;and&#8208;match platform is demonstrated. Through the immobilization of biotinylated growth factors, the use of these engineered substrates to program cell behaviors is highlighted.








Abstract
Strategies that mimic the spatial complexity of natural tissues can provide cellular scaffolds to probe fundamental questions in cell biology and offer new materials for regenerative medicine. Here, the authors demonstrate a light&#8208;guided patterning platform that uses natural engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a substrate to program cellular behaviors. A photocaged diene which undergoes Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based click chemistry upon uncaging with 365&#160;nm light is utilized. By interfacing with commercially available maleimide dienophiles, patterning of common ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin Matrigel, laminin) with readily purchased functional small molecules and growth factors is achieved. Finally, the use of this platform to spatially control ERK activity and migration in mammalian cells is highlighted, demonstrating programmable cell behavior through patterned chemical modification of natural ECM.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipidoids is constructed with the aim to develop new AMB&#8208;POC18 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for robust messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection exclusively in the spleen. The AMB&#8208;POC18 LNPs encapsulating tumor antigen mRNA can effectively transfect antigen&#8208;presenting cells, induce the proliferation of effector T cells, and exhibit potent therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against melanoma without side effects.









Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) are reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in the spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates the potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective RNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The preparation of highly conductive media and the construction of conducting channels play a crucial role in improving the electrical conductivity of electrically conductive adhesives. Therefore, a new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3%. By mixing MXene modified with Ag&#8208;plated copper powder in a quantitative relationship to form high conductive media, the electrical conductivity is largely improved and the defect of low electron transfer rate of conventional conductive fillers is broken. The potential value of high conductive media is largely exploited using high throughput and machine learning methods, and here we show that the resistivity has reached 9.668 &#215; 10&#8722;7 &#937; m. The first principles investigate the conductive channels and electron transfer pathways of high&#8208;conductive media at the atomic level, further revealing the mechanism of action of high&#8208;conductive media. This study is also the first report on the application of MXene to high&#8208;conductive media.

         <title>Multifunctional, Hybrid Materials Design via Spray&#8208;Drying: Much more than Just Drying</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spray&#8208;drying is a versatile and powerful method for designing multifunctional and hybrid materials. Its potential for different material formation strategies and different application scenarios, as well as its advantages and challenges, are highlighted.








Abstract
Spray&#8208;drying is a popular and well&#8208;known &#8220;drying tool&#8221; for engineers. This perspective&#160;highlights that, beyond this application, spray&#8208;drying is a very interesting and powerful tool for materials chemists to enable the design of multifunctional and hybrid materials. Upon spray&#8208;drying, the confined space of a liquid droplet is narrowed down, and its ingredients are forced together upon &#8220;falling dry.&#8221; As &#160;detailed in this article, this enables the following material formation strategies either individually or even in combination: nanoparticles and/or molecules can be assembled; precipitation reactions as well as chemical syntheses can be performed; and templated materials can be designed. Beyond this, fragile moieties can be processed, or &#8220;precursor materials&#8221; be prepared. Post&#8208;treatment of spray&#8208;dried objects eventually enables the next level in the design of complex materials. Using spray&#8208;drying to design (particulate) materials comes with many advantages&#8212;but also with many challenges&#8212;all of which are outlined here.&#160;It is&#160;believed that multifunctional, hybrid materials, made via spray&#8208;drying, enable very unique property combinations that are particularly highly promising in myriad applications&#8212;of which catalysis, diagnostics, purification, storage, and information are highlighted.

         <title>Heterostructures Regulating Lithium Polysulfides for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures could regulate lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. This review systematically and detailedly analyzes the principle and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to promote the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides seriously hinder the development of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Heterostructures, due to unique properties, have congenital advantages that are difficult to be achieved by single&#8208;component materials in regulating lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this review, the principles of heterostructures expediting lithium polysulfides conversion and anchoring lithium polysulfides are detailedly analyzed, and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is systematically reviewed. Finally, the problems that need to be solved in the future study and application of heterostructures in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are prospected. This review will provide a valuable reference for the development of heterostructures in advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Resonant&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Enhanced Electrochromic Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices demonstrate significant potential to enable multicolor characteristics, fast response times, and long cycling lifetimes. This review focuses on the up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements and some issues remaining for the future development of emerging electrochromic materials and devices based on different types of optical resonators, as well as the potential extended applications of these materials and devices.








Abstract
With rapid advances in optoelectronics, electrochromic materials and devices have received tremendous attentions from both industry and academia for their strong potentials in wearable and portable electronics, displays/billboards, adaptive camouflage, tunable optics, and intelligent devices, etc. However, conventional electrochromic materials and devices typically present some serious limitations such as undesirable dull colors, and long switching time, hindering their deeper development. Optical resonators have been proven to be the most powerful platform for providing strong optical confinement and controllable lightmatter interactions. They generate locally enhanced electromagnetic near&#8208;fields that can convert small refractive index changes in electrochromic materials into high&#8208;contrast color variations, enabling multicolor or even panchromatic tuning of electrochromic materials. Here, resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices, an advanced and emerging trend in electrochromics, are reviewed. In this review, w e will focus on the progress in multicolor electrochromic materials and devices based on different types of optical resonators and their advanced and emerging applications, including multichromatic displays, adaptive visible camouflage, visualized energy storage, and applications of multispectral tunability. Among these topics, principles of optical resonators, related materials/devices and multicolor electrochromic properties are comprehensively discussed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects for resonant&#8208;cavity&#8208;enhanced electrochromic materials and devices are presented.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Body Biomarker Entrapment System: An All&#8208;Encompassing Tool for Ultrasensitive Disease Diagnosis and Epidemic Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;body biomarker entrapment system based on a carbon nanotube liquid&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor and DNA framework engineering is proposed. This versatile platform enables clinical diagnosis of endometriosis, specific recognition of monkeypox virus antigen protein, and non&#8208;amplification identification of circulating tumor DNA in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive identification of biomarkers in biofluids is essential for the precise diagnosis of diseases. For the gold standard approaches, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay, cumbersome operational steps hinder their point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. Here, a bionic biomarker entrapment system (BioES) is implemented, which employs a multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped tetrahedral DNA probe immobilized on carbon nanotube transistors. Clinical identification of endometriosis is successfully realized by detecting an estrogen receptor, ER&#946;, from the lesion tissue of endometriosis patients and establishing a standard diagnosis procedure. The multi&#8208;body Y&#8208;shaped BioES achieves a theoretical limit of detection (LoD) of 6.74 aM and a limit of quantification&#160;of 141&#160;aM in a complex protein milieu. Furthermore, the BioES is optimized into a multi&#8208;site recognition module for enhanced binding efficiency, realizing the first identification of monkeypox virus antigen A35R and unamplified detection of circulating tumor DNA of breast cancer in serum. The rigid and compact probe framework with synergy effect enables the BioES to target A35R and DNA with a LoD down to 991 and 0.21&#160;aM, respectively. Owing to its versatility for proteins and nucleic acids as well as ease of manipulation and ultra&#8208;sensitivity, the BioES can be leveraged as an all&#8208;encompassing tool for population&#8208;wide screening of epidemics and clinical disease diagnosis.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Voltage, High&#8208;Force Capacity Electroadhesive Clutch Based on Ionoelastomer Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough ionoelastomer&#8208;metal mesh composites with low surface energies and controlled surface roughness are synthesized to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models from fracture mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface roughness affect force capacity. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by 5&#8208;fold in force capacity per unit area, with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage.








Abstract
Electroadhesive devices with dielectric films can electrically program changes in stiffness and adhesion, but require hundreds of volts and are subject to failure by dielectric breakdown. Recent work on ionoelastomer heterojunctions has enabled reversible electroadhesion with low voltages, but these materials exhibit limited force capacities and high detachment forces. It is a grand challenge to engineer electroadhesives with large force capacities and programmable detachment at low voltages (&lt;10&#160;V). In this work, tough ionoelastomer/metal mesh composites with low surface energies are synthesized and surface roughness is controlled to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models based on fracture and contact mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface texture affect force capacity and contact area, which is validated over different geometries and voltages. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the best existing electroadhesive clutches by fivefold in force capacity per unit area (102 N cm&#8722;2), with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage (&#177; 7.5&#160;V). Finally, the ability of the ionoelastomer clutches to resist bending moments in a finger wearable and as a reversible adhesive in an adjustable phone mount is demonstrated.

         <title>Tailoring the Atomic&#8208;Local Environment of Carbon Nanotube Tips for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reasonably regulating the atomic&#8208;local environment of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts is critical for upgrading the catalytic activity of a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, N,S co&#8208;modified atomic environment of carbon nanotube (CNT) zigzag edges is developed, which endows the CNTs with high activity, selectivity, and stability for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis from the air in both flow cell and solid&#8208;electrolyte configuration.








Abstract
The atomic&#8208;local environment of catalytically active sites plays an important role in tuning the activity of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs). However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball&#8208;milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips that are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N,S&#8208;rich tips (N,S&#8208;TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H2O2 selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O2 source, the flow cell system with N,S&#8208;TCNTs catalyst attains high H2O2 productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1@350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, superior to most reported C&#8208;MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S&#8208;TCNTs is further employed to realize the in&#8208;situ continuous generation of pure H2O2 solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1@300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold great promise for practical applications, even beyond H2O2 generation.

However, the rational regulation of the environment is always impeded by synthetic limitations and insufficient understanding of the formation mechanism of the catalytic sites. Herein, the possible cleavage mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the crossing points during ball-milling is proposed, resulting in abundant CNT tips that are more susceptible to be modified by heteroatoms, achieving precise modulation of the atomic environment at the tips. The obtained CNTs with N,S-rich tips (N,S-TCNTs) exhibit a wide potential window of 0.59&#160;V along with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity for over 90.0%. Even using air as the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source, the flow cell system with N,S-TCNTs catalyst attains high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; productivity up to 30.37&#160;mol&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@350&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to most reported C-MFECs. From a practical point of view, a solid electrolyzer based on N,S-TCNTs is further employed to realize the in-situ continuous generation of pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution with high productivity (up to 4.35&#160;mmol&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@300&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; over 300&#160;h). The CNTs with functionalized tips hold great promise for practical applications, even beyond H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptional Microscale Plasticity in Amorphous Aluminum Oxide at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasticity in ceramics, including oxide glasses, is difficult to achieve and typically occurs only at high temperatures. Amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) makes an exception to the rule by showing substantial ductility at room temperature. The microscale compression samples (micropillars with 2.25&#8211;11 &#181;m diameter) are shown to deform without fracture even under fast impact loading resembling for example hammer forging.








Abstract
Oxide glasses are an elementary group of materials in modern society, but brittleness limits their wider usability at room temperature. As an exception to the rule, amorphous aluminum oxide (a&#8208;Al2O3) is a rare diatomic glassy material exhibiting significant nanoscale plasticity at room temperature. Here, it is shown experimentally that the room temperature plasticity of a&#8208;Al2O3 extends to the microscale and high strain rates using in situ micropillar compression. All tested a&#8208;Al2O3 micropillars deform without fracture at up to 50% strain via a combined mechanism of viscous creep and shear band slip propagation. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations align with the main experimental observations and verify the plasticity mechanism at the atomic scale. The experimental strain rates reach magnitudes typical for impact loading scenarios, such as hammer forging, with strain rates up to the order of 1 000 s&#8722;1, and the total a&#8208;Al2O3 sample volume exhibiting significant low&#8208;temperature plasticity without fracture is expanded by 5 orders of magnitude from previous observations. The discovery is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the plasticity observed in a&#8208;Al2O3 can extend to macroscopic bulk scale and suggests that amorphous oxides show significant potential to be used as light, high&#8208;strength, and damage&#8208;tolerant engineering materials.

         <title>Tunable Chiral Plasmonic Activities Enabled via Stimuli Responsive Micro&#8208;Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D chiral plasmonic structures are realized through shape&#8208;morphing of responsive polymer&#8208;based origami. Gold nanospheres (AuNSs) are assembled as large&#8208;scale, highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular polymer micro&#8208;sheets. Upon self&#8208;rolling of the sheets into micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNSs can be arranged in a 3D helical morphology. Tunable circular dichroism signals over mode frequency, magnitude, and switchable handedness are achieved.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with distinctive circularly polarized light&#8208;dependent optical responses over a broad range of frequency have great potential for photonic and biomedical applications. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate 3D plasmonic chiral micro&#8208;constructs with readily modulated chiroptical properties over the magnitude of ellipticity, mode frequency, and switchable handedness, especially in the vis&#8211;NIR range. In this study, polymeric micro&#8208;origami&#8208;based 3D plasmonic chiral structures are constructed through self&#8208;rolling of gold&#160; nanospheres (AuNSs)&#8208;decorated polymeric micro&#8208;sheets. Spherical AuNSs are assembled as highly ordered linear chains on 2D rectangular micro&#8208;sheets by polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;wrinkle assisted assembly. Upon rolling the micro&#8208;sheets to micro&#8208;tubules, the AuNS chains transform into 3D helices. The AuNS&#8208;assembled helices induce collective plasmonic modes propagating in a helical manner, leading to a strong chiral response over the vis&#8211;NIR range. The circular dichroism (CD) is measured to be as high as hundreds of millidegree, and the position and sign of CD peaks are actively modulated by controlling the orientated angle of AuNS chains, enabled by tuning the collective plasmonic modes. This micro&#8208;origami&#8208;based strategy incorporates the incompatible 2D assembly technique with 3D chiral structures, opening up an intriguing way toward constructing chiral plasmonic structures and modulating chiroptical effects based on responsive polymeric materials.

         <title>Mechanism for Generating H2O2 at Water&#8208;Solid Interface by Contact&#8208;Electrification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work shows that H2O2 can be produced from water and air through oxidoreduction processes triggered by ultrasound&#8208;driven contact&#8208;electrification at the interface of water and fluorinated ethylene propylene. The performance of the method greatly surpasses present piezocatalysis. This work proposes a clear demonstration of the mechanism and the contribution of the hydrogen bound network to the formation of H2O2.








Abstract
The recent intensification of the study of contact&#8208;electrification at water&#8208;solid interfaces and its role in physicochemical processes lead to the realization that electron transfers during water&#8208;solid contact&#8208;electrification can drive chemical reactions. This mechanism, named contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), allows chemically inert fluorinated polymers to act like single electrode electrochemical systems. This study shows hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generated from air and deionized water, by ultrasound driven CEC, using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as the catalyst. For a mass ratio of catalyst to solution of 1:10000, at 20&#160;&#176;C, the kinetic rate of H2O2 evolution reaches 58.87&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows electrons are emitted in the solution by the charged FEP, during ultrasonication. EPR and isotope labelling experiments show H2O2 is formed from hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8226;) or two superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generated by CEC. Finally, it is traditionally believed such radicals migrate in the solution by Brownian diffusion prior to reactions. However, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamic calculations reveal the radicals can react by exchanging protons and electrons through the hydrogen bonds network of water, i.e., owing to the Grotthuss mechanism. This mechanism can be relevant to other systems, artificial or natural, generating H2O2 from air and water.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Metabolic Modulators Leads to Simultaneous Lactate Metabolism Inhibition and Intracellular Acidification for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sufficient amount of lactate transporter inhibitor (small molecule), glucose oxidase (enzyme), and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are simultaneously delivered to cancer cells using large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a vehicle and albumin as a carrier for small molecule. This combination synergistically induces lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification, leading to severe ATP depletion and subsequent cancer cell death.








Abstract
Simultaneous lactate metabolism inhibition and intracellular acidification (LIIA) is a promising approach for inducing tumor regression by depleting ATP. However, given the limited efficacy of individual metabolic modulators, a combination of various modulators is required for highly efficient LIIA. Herein, a co&#8208;delivery system that combines lactate transporter inhibitor, glucose oxidase, and O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles is proposed. As a vehicle, a facile room&#8208;temperature synthetic method for large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L&#8208;MSNs) is developed. O2&#8208;evolving nanoparticles are then conjugated onto L&#8208;MSNs, followed by immobilizing the lactate transporter inhibitor and glucose oxidase inside the pores of L&#8208;MSNs. To load the lactate transporter inhibitor, which is too small to be directly loaded into the large pores, it is encapsulated in albumin by controlling the albumin conformation before being loaded into L&#8208;MSNs. Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L&#8208;MSN&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co&#8208;delivery of small&#8208;molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.

Notably, inhibiting lactate efflux shifts the glucose consumption mechanism from lactate metabolism to glucose oxidase reaction, which eliminates glucose and produces acid. This leads to synergistic LIIA and subsequent ATP depletion in cancer cells. Consequently, L-MSN-based co-delivery of modulators for LIIA shows high anticancer efficacy in several mouse tumor models without toxicity in normal tissues. This study provides new insights into co-delivery of small-molecule drugs, proteins, and nanoparticles for synergistic metabolic modulation in tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution Processed Semi&#8208;Transparent Organic Solar Cells Over 50% Visible Transmittance Enabled by Silver Nanowire Electrode with Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed sandwich structure silver&#8208;nanowires top electrode is designed for semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) to address conductivity and processibility issues. Compared with traditional evaporated Ag counterpart, ST&#8208;OPV based on the new electrode achieves more excellent optical and electrical properties, including light utilization efficiency, transmittance, reflection rate, viewing angle, and can tolerate harsher mechanical bending on flexible substrates.








Abstract
Photovoltaic windows with easy installation for the power supply of household appliances have long been a desire of energy researchers. However, due to the lack of top electrodes that offer both high transparency and low sheet resistance, the development of high&#8208;transparency photovoltaic windows for indoor lighting scenarios has lagged significantly behind photovoltaic windows where privacy issues are involved. Addressing this issue, this work develops a solution&#8208;processable transparent top electrode using sandwich structure silver nanowires, realizing high transparency in semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. The wettability and conducting properties of the electrode are improved by a modified hole&#8208;transport layer named HP. The semi&#8208;transparent solar cell exhibits good see&#8208;through properties at a high average visible transmittance of 50.8%, with power conversion efficiency of 7.34%, and light utilization efficiency of 3.73%, which is the highest without optical modulations. Moreover, flexible devices based on the above&#8208;mentioned architecture also show excellent mechanical tolerance compared with Ag electrode counterparts, which retains 94.5% of their original efficiency after 1500 bending cycles. This work provides a valuable approach for fabricating solution&#8208;processed high transparency organic solar cells, which is essential in future applications in building integrated photovoltaics.

         <title>A 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d High Entropy Alloy as a Bifunctional Oxygen Catalyst for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noble metal&#8208;free 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d high entropy alloy, FeCoNiMoW, with high configurational entropy, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure is an efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst for robust aqueous, solid, and flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
High entropy alloys (HEAs) are highly suitable candidate catalysts for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR)&#160;as they offer numerous parameters for optimizing the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Herein, FeCoNiMoW HEA nanoparticles are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature approach. Such FeCoNiMoW nanoparticles show high entropy properties, subtle lattice distortions, and modulated electronic structure, leading to superior OER performance with an overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 276&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electronic structures of the FeCoNiMoW active sites with an optimized d&#8208;band center position that enables suitable adsorption of OOH* intermediates and reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier in the OER process. Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) based on this HEA demonstrate a high open circuit potential of 1.59&#160;V, a peak power density of 116.9&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, a specific capacity of 857&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1, and excellent stability for over 660&#160;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Flexible and solid ZABs are also assembled and tested, displaying excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance at different bending angles. This work shows the significance of 4d/5d metal&#8208;modulated electronic structure and optimized adsorption ability to improve the performance of OER/ORR, ZABs, and beyond.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, we assumed the chirality of nanocarriers was also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, we fabricated L/D&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L/D&#8208;CMSNs) via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;condensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers would be benefited from their chirality. We found that L&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the D&#8208;chiral (D&#8208;CMSN), racemic (DL&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the multiple chiral recognition mechanisms following simple differential adsorption on bio&#8208;interfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction was the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, L&#8208;CMSN, which was proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible and biodegradable, was efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helped the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger anti&#8208;tumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>Synergetic Sn Incorporation&#8208;Zn Substitution in Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation&#8208;Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper&#8208;based sulfides. First, the Na&#8208;ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy&#8208;based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied with the sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na&#8208;ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve the cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote the Na&#8208;ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve the mechanical strain&#8208;stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow the copper&#8208;based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8764;560 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8764;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&#8722;1, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8764;4 s per charging with &#8764;190 mAh g&#8722;1 input). This work provides in&#8208;depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi&#8208;cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.

         <title>Revealing The Deposition Mechanism of The Powder Aerosol Deposition Method Using Ceramic Oxide Core&#8208;Shell Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Powder Aerosol Deposition method (PAD) is a process to manufacture ceramic films completely at room temperature. Since the first reports by Akedo in the late 1990s, much research has been conducted to reveal the exact mechanism of the deposition process. However, it is still not fully understood. We tackled this challenge using core shell particles. Two coated oxides, Al2O3 core with a SiO2 shell and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 core with a LiNbO3 shell, were investigated. Initially, the element ratios Al:Si and Ni:Nb of the powder were determined by EDX. In a second step, the change in the element ratios of Al:Si and Ni:Nb after deposition were investigated. The element ratios from powder to film strongly shift towards the shell&#8208;elements, indicating that the particles fracture and only the outer parts of the particles are deposited. In the last step, we investigated cross&#8208;sections of the deposited films with STEM combined with EDX and an EsB detector to unveil the element distribution within the film itself. Therefore, the following overall picture emerges: particles impact on the substrate or on previously deposited particle, fracture, and only a small part of the impacting particles that originate from the outer part of the impacting particle gets deposited.

Since the first reports by Akedo in the late 1990s, much research has been conducted to reveal the exact mechanism of the deposition process. However, it is still not fully understood. We tackled this challenge using core shell particles. Two coated oxides, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; core with a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core with a LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shell, were investigated. Initially, the element ratios Al:Si and Ni:Nb of the powder were determined by EDX. In a second step, the change in the element ratios of Al:Si and Ni:Nb after deposition were investigated. The element ratios from powder to film strongly shift towards the shell-elements, indicating that the particles fracture and only the outer parts of the particles are deposited. In the last step, we investigated cross-sections of the deposited films with STEM combined with EDX and an EsB detector to unveil the element distribution within the film itself. Therefore, the following overall picture emerges: particles impact on the substrate or on previously deposited particle, fracture, and only a small part of the impacting particles that originate from the outer part of the impacting particle gets deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Simultaneous Catalytic Acceleration of White Phosphorus Polymerization And Red Phosphorus Potassiation for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) possesses ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity (1154 mAh g&#8722;1). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K&#8208;P alloying limit its practical application. Seeking an efficient catalyst to address above problems is crucial for secure preparation of red P anode with high performance. Herein, through the analysis of the activation energies in white P polymerization, it is revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of I2 (&#8208;7.40&#160;eV) is in proximity to P4 (&#8208;7.25&#160;eV), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of I2 molecule (&#8208;4.20&#160;eV) is lower than that of other common non&#8208;metallic molecules (N2, S8, Se8, F2, Cl2, Br2). The introduction of I2 can thus promote the breaking of P&#8208;P bond and accelerate the polymerization of white P molecules. Besides, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations show the I2 can enhance the kinetics of P&#8208;K alloying. The as&#8208;obtained red P/C composites with I2 deliver excellent cycling stability (358 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). This study establishes catalysis as a promising pathway to tackle the challenges of P anode for alkali metal ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) possesses ultra-high theoretical specific capacity (1154 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K-P alloying limit its practical application.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Efficiency And Operational&#8208;Stability of Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells via Interfacial Toughening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We have investigated the combined effects of compact TiO2 (c&#8208;TiO2) electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) without and with mesoscopic TiO2 (m&#8208;TiO2) on top, and without and with an iodine&#8208;terminated silane self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), on the mechanical behavior, opto&#8208;electronic properties, photovoltaic (PV) performance, and operational&#8208;stability of solar cells based on metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs). The interfacial toughness increases almost three&#8208;fold in going from c&#8208;TiO2 without SAM to m&#8208;TiO2 with SAM. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the m&#8208;TiO2/MHP nanocomposite at the interface and the enhanced adhesion afforded by the iodine&#8208;terminated silane SAM. The combination of m&#8208;TiO2 and SAM also offers a significant beneficial effect on the photocarriers extraction at the ETL/MHP interface, resulting in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 24% and 20% for 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2 active areas, respectively. These PSCs also have exceptionally long operational&#8208;stability lives: extrapolated T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) is about 18,000&#160;h and 10,000&#160;h for 0.1 cm2 for 1 cm2 active areas, respectively. Postmortem characterization and analyses of the operational&#8208;stability&#8208;tested PSCs were performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the long operational&#8208;stability.

         <title>Achieving Desired Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells via Binary&#8208;Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The sequential deposition process has demonstrated the great possibility to achieve a photolayer architecture with an ideal gradient phase separation morphology, which has a vital influence on the physical processes that determine the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the controllable preparation of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) with gradient distribution has not been effectively elucidated. Herein, we have proposed a binary&#8208;dilution strategy, the PM6 solution with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and the L8&#8208;BO solution with micro donor PM6 respectively, to form P&#8208;PHJ film. This architecture exists good donor (D) and acceptor (A) vertical gradient distribution and larger D/A interpenetrating regions, which promotes exciton generation and dissociation, shortens charge transport distance and optimizes carrier dynamics. Moreover, the dilution of PM6 by BO&#8208;4Cl promotes the regulation of active layer aggregation size and phase purity, thus alleviating energy disorder and voltage loss. As a result, the P&#8208;PHJ device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.32% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.92&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, much higher than planar binary heterojunction (17.67%) and ternary bulk heterojunction (18.49%) devices. This research proves a simple but effective method to provide an avenue for constructing desirable active layer morphology and high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>The Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as example, we herein illustrate how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on Zn metal anode. The in&#8208;situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups have been constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which has improved the electrochemical performance of Zn||V2O5 full cell. DFT calculations combined with water contact angle measurements demonstrated that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water contact angle and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how excellent reversibility has been achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIBs anode.

         <title>Lanthanide Three&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Framework Boosts Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with High Uv Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this work, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process is exploited to derive lanthanide organic framework (Tb&#8208;cpon) modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced performance under UV irradiation. Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit rapid response and reduced degradation due to energy down&#8208;conversion facilitated by effective coupling of UV&#8208;sensitive chromophores to lanthanide luminescent centers, enhancing the spectral response range of the composite films. Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb&#8208;cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb&#8208;cpon modified PSC devices obtained a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.

Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb-cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb-cpon-perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb-cpon modified PSC devices obtained a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Universal Stripe Symmetry of Short&#8208;range Charge Density Waves in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The omnipresence of charge density waves (CDWs) across almost all cuprate families underpins a common organizing principle. However, a longstanding debate of whether its spatial symmetry is stripe or checkerboard remains unresolved. While CDWs in lanthanum&#8208; and yttrium&#8208;based cuprates possess a stripe symmetry, distinguishing these two scenarios has been challenging for the short&#8208;range CDW in bismuth&#8208;based cuprates. Here, we&#160; employed high&#8208;resolution resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering to uncover the spatial symmetry of the CDW in Bi2$_2$Sr2&#8722;x$_{2-x}$Lax$_{x}$CuO6+&#948;$_{6+\delta }$. Across a wide range of doping and temperature, anisotropic CDW peaks with elliptical shapes were&#160; found in reciprocal space. Based on Fourier transform analysis of real&#8208;space models, we&#160; interpret the results as evidence of unidirectional charge stripes, hosted by mutually 90&#8728;$^\circ$&#8208;rotated anisotropic domains. Our&#160; work paves the way for a unified symmetry and microscopic description of CDW order in&#160;cuprates.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries Boosted by a Multifunctional Janus Separator Over a Wide Temperature Range of &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C</title>

A Janus separator coated by hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on polypropylene separator is constructed to achieve high&#8208;rate performances of Li&#8211;Se batteries over &#8722;30&#8211;60 &#176;C. The excellent performances result from &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed &#8216;shuttling effect&#8217; by hNCNC on cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrites by AlN&#8208;network on anode side, well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;selenium batteries are characterized by high volumetric capacity comparable to Li&#8211;S batteries, while &#8776;1025 times higher electrical conductivity of Se than S is favorable for high&#8208;rate capability. However, they also suffer from the &#8220;shuttling effect&#8221; of lithium polyselenides (LPSes) and Li dendrite growth. Herein, a multifunctional Janus separator is designed by coating hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on two sides of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to overcome these hindrances. At room temperature, the Li&#8211;Se batteries with the Janus separator exhibit an unprecedented high&#8208;rate capability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 C) and retain a high capacity of 408 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the high retained capacities are achieved over a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, showing the potential application under extreme environments. The excellent performances result from the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergism of suppressed LPSes shuttling by chemisorption and electrocatalysis of hNCNC on the cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrite growth by thermally conductive AlN&#8208;network on the anode side, which can be well understood by the &#8220;Bucket Effect&#8221;. This Janus separator provides a general strategy to develop high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;chalcogen (Se, S, SeS2) batteries.

         <title>Imaging Light&#8208;Induced Migration of Dislocations in Halide Perovskites with 3d Nanoscale Strain Mapping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites are exciting materials for optoelectronic devices. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields and dislocation defects. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered, and the impact of these defects on material performance is unveiled.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been used to make high&#8208;performance solar cells and light&#8208;emitting devices. However, material defects still limit device performance and stability. Here, synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to visualize nanoscale strain fields, such as those local to defects, in halide perovskite microcrystals. Significant strain heterogeneity within MAPbBr3 (MA = CH3NH3+) crystals is found&#160;in spite of their high optoelectronic quality, and both &#12296;100&#12297; and &#12296;110&#12297; edge dislocations are identified through analysis of their local strain fields. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers is uncovered. Further, by selectively studying crystals that are damaged by the X&#8208;ray beam, large dislocation densities and increased nanoscale strains are correlated with material degradation and substantially altered optoelectronic properties assessed using photoluminescence microscopy measurements. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of extended defects and strain in halide perovskites, which will have important consequences for device performance and operational stability.

         <dc:description>
Here, the authors summarize the current state of printable organic and perovskite solar cells and shared their view regarding the challenges and prospects toward commercialization. Different printing techniques involving the correlation between material properties and printing mechanisms are analyzed. The authors also discuss the optimization of ink formulation, large&#8208;area film deposition, and design of module structure.








Abstract
Photovoltaic technology presents a sustainable solution to address the escalating global energy consumption and a reliable strategy for achieving net&#8208;zero carbon emissions by 2050. Emerging photovoltaic technologies, especially the printable organic and perovskite solar cells, have attracted extensive attention due to their rapidly transcending power conversion efficiencies and facile processability, providing great potential to revolutionize the global photovoltaic market. To accelerate these technologies to translate from the laboratory scale to the industrial level, it is critical to develop well&#8208;defined and scalable protocols to deposit high&#8208;quality thin films of photoactive and charge&#8208;transporting materials. Herein, the current state of printable organic and perovskite solar cells is summarized and the view regarding the challenges and prospects toward their commercialization is shared. Different printing techniques are first introduced to provide a correlation between material properties and printing mechanisms, and the optimization of ink formulation and film&#8208;formation during large&#8208;area deposition of different functional layers in devices are then discussed. Engineering perspectives are also discussed to analyze the criteria for module design. Finally, perspectives are provided regarding the future development of these solar cells toward practical commercialization. It is believed that this perspective will provide insight into the development of printable solar cells and other electronic devices.

         <title>Compact Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Enabled by Disassembling Micelles in Solution for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles formed by the amphiphilic self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#160;molecules is introduced. The pre&#8208;disassembly of micelles reduces the energetic barrier to form a densely packed SAM. This strategy universally enhances the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on MeO&#8208;2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM hole&#8208;selective layers. The champion device based on the CbzNaph processed from co&#8208;solvent achieves a high PCE of 24.98% with an impressive fill factor of 85.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely employed as effective hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most SAM molecules are amphiphilic in nature and tend to form micelles in the commonly used alcoholic processing solvents. This introduces an extra energetic barrier to disassemble the micelles during the binding of SAM molecules on the substrate surface, limiting the formation of a compact SAM. To alleviate this problem for achieving optimal SAM growth, a co&#8208;solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles of carbazole&#8208;based SAM molecules in the processing solution is developed.

&lt;p&gt;The co-solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles formed by the amphiphilic self-assembled monolayer (SAM)&#160;molecules is introduced. The pre-disassembly of micelles reduces the energetic barrier to form a densely packed SAM. This strategy universally enhances the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on MeO-2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM hole-selective layers. The champion device based on the CbzNaph processed from co-solvent achieves a high PCE of 24.98% with an impressive fill factor of 85.06%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely employed as effective hole-selective layers (HSLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most SAM molecules are amphiphilic in nature and tend to form micelles in the commonly used alcoholic processing solvents. This introduces an extra energetic barrier to disassemble the micelles during the binding of SAM molecules on the substrate surface, limiting the formation of a compact SAM. To alleviate this problem for achieving optimal SAM growth, a co-solvent strategy to disassemble the micelles of carbazole-based SAM molecules in the processing solution is developed. This effectively increases the critical micelle concentration to be above the processing concentration and enhances the reactivity of the phosphonic acid anchoring group to allow densely packed SAMs to be formed on indium tin oxide. Consequently, the PSCs derived from using MeO-2PACz, 2PACz, and CbzNaph SAM HSLs show universally improved performance, with the CbzNaph SAM-derived device achieving a champion efficiency of 24.98% and improved stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Imaging and Domain Nucleation in CrSBr Down to the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using direct magnetic imaging of CrSBr, a van der Waals material 2D antiferromagnet, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy and moment density are nearly preserved down to the monolayer. These images reveal the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls down to the monolayer. This material shows remarkable stability even for monolayer exposed to air.








Abstract
Recent advancements in 2D materials have revealed the potential of van der Waals magnets, and specifically of their magnetic anisotropy that allows applications down to the 2D limit. Among these materials, CrSBr has emerged as a promising candidate, because its intriguing magnetic and electronic properties have appeal for both fundamental and applied research in spintronics or magnonics. In this work, nano&#8208;SQUID&#8208;on&#8208;tip (SOT) microscopy is used to obtain direct magnetic imaging of CrSBr flakes with thicknesses ranging from monolayer (N = 1) to few&#8208;layer (N = 5). The ferromagnetic order is preserved down to the monolayer, while the antiferromagnetic coupling of the layers starts from the bilayer case. For odd layers, at zero applied magnetic field, the stray field resulting from the&#160;uncompensated layer is directly imaged. The progressive spin reorientation along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction (hard axis) is also measured with a finite applied magnetic field, allowing evaluation of the anisotropy constant, which remains stable down to the monolayer and is close to the bulk value. Finally, by selecting the applied magnetic field protocol, the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls is observed down to the single&#8208;layer limit.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on The Regulation of Solvent&#8208;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 lies in the control of nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. In this study, a strategy has been developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in&#8208;situ characterizations, we illustrate the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 PSCs fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

Abstract
The latest developments in fiber design and materials science are paving the way for fibers to evolve from parts in passive components to functional parts in active fabrics. Designing conformable, organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) structures using poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) fibers has excellent potential for low&#8208;cost wearable bioelectronics, bio&#8208;hybrid devices and adaptive neuromorphic technologies. However, realizing this potential requires developing approaches to form good electrodes, on small fiber diameters with poor wettability and irregular coatings, to achieve high&#8208;performance and good stability devices. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS&#8208;fiber fabrication needs to move away from small batch processing to roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll or continuous processing. Here, we show that synergistic effects from a superior electrode/organic interface, and exceptional fiber alignment from continuous processing, enable PEDOT:PSS fiber&#8208;OECTs with stable contacts, high &#956;C* product (1570.5 F/cmVs), and high hole mobility over 45 cm2/Vs. We developed fiber&#8208;electrochemical neuromorphic organic devices (fiber&#8208;ENODes) to demonstrate that the high mobility fibers are promising building blocks for future bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. The fiber&#8208;ENODes have synaptic weight update in response to dopamine, as well as a form factor closely matching the neuronal axon terminal.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Advancing Energy Harvesting Efficiency from a Single Droplet: A Mechanically Guided 4D Printed Elastic Hybrid Droplet&#8208;Based Electricity Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) is first developed by simply hybridizing droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator, using mechanically guided 4D printing. HDEG has an enhanced electrical output performance from a single droplet by using the dissipated energy during droplet impact. This approach opens a new frontier in system development that efficiently collects energy from the ubiquitous droplets.








Abstract
A droplet possesses the ubiquity and potential to harvest a vast amount of energy. To exploit droplets effectively, a novel output enhancement strategy that can coexist and create synergy with the recently studied droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) and material/surface structure modification must be investigated. In this study, a mechanical buckling&#8208;based 4D printed elastic hybrid droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (HDEG) consisting of a DEG and solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator (S&#8211;S TENG) is first presented. During the electricity generation process of the DEG by droplet impact, the HDEG structure, which is merged via a simple 4D printing technique, permits the conversion of dissipated energy into elastic energy, resulting in an S&#8211;S TENG output. The HDEG outputs are naturally integrated owing to the simultaneous activation of a single droplet, resulting in an approximately 30% improvement over the output of a single DEG. Internal and external parametric studies are performed as HDEG design guidelines. The HDEG exhibits a 25% better energy supply performance than that of a single DEG, demonstrating its applicability as a power source. This research proposes the way toward a hybrid system that efficiently harvests energy from ubiquitous droplets.

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid droplet-based electricity generator (HDEG) is first developed by simply hybridizing droplet-based electricity generator and solid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerator, using mechanically guided 4D printing. HDEG has an enhanced electrical output performance from a single droplet by using the dissipated energy during droplet impact. This approach opens a new frontier in system development that efficiently collects energy from the ubiquitous droplets.

         <title>Insight into Defect Engineering of Atomically Dispersed Iron Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic activity of the atomically dispersed iron catalyst is controlled by defect fine&#8208;tuning to achieve remarkable electrocatalytic performance. The defects in the carbon plane modulate the valence and spin states of the Fe centers in Fe&#8208;N4. The change in the atomic and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 leads to a superior MEA performance by optimizing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated iron catalysts (Fe&#8208;NCs) demonstrate potential as alternatives to platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM) catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, in the context of practical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performances of Fe&#8208;NCs remain unsatisfactory. Herein, improved MEA performance is achieved by tuning the local environment of the Fe&#8208;NC catalysts through defect engineering. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with additional CO2 activation is employed to construct atomically dispersed iron sites with a controlled defect number. The Fe&#8208;NC species with the optimal number of defect sites exhibit excellent ORR performance with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#160;V in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Variation in the number of defects allows for fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediate binding energies by changing the contribution of the Fe d&#8208;orbitals, thereby optimizing the ORR activity. The MEA based on a defect&#8208;engineered Fe&#8208;NC catalyst is found to exhibit a remarkable peak power density of 1.1&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in an H2/O2 fuel cell, and 0.67&#160;W cm&#8722;2&#8197;in an H2/air fuel cell, rendering it one of the most active atomically dispersed catalyst materials at the MEA level.

         <title>Stabilizing the Deep Sodiation Process in Layered Sodium Manganese Cathodes by Anchoring Boron Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The boron anchoring strategy in which inserting boron atoms into interstices between transition metal oxide layers has been proposed and implemented. Benefiting from easing anisotropic strains and reducing interlayer gliding during the deep sodiation process, the (Na0.637B0.038MnO2) B&#8208;NMO cathode material shows a remarkable specific capacity in the continuous cycling in sodium ion batteries.









Abstract
Advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are inseparable from cathode materials with high specific capacities. Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (NaxMnO2, 0.6&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;1) are promising cathode materials owing to their ease of intercalation and extraction of a considerable amount of sodium ions. However, lattice interactions, especially electrostatic repulsive forces and anisotropic stresses, are usually caused by deep desodiatin/sodiation process, resulting in intragranular cracks and capacity degradation in SIBs. Here, boron ions are introduced into the layered structure to build up B&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds. The regulated electronic structure in Na0.637B0.038MnO2 (B&#8208;NMO) materials inhibits the deformation of MnO6 octahedra, which finally achieves a gentle structural transition during the deep sodiation process. B&#8208;NMO electrode exhibits a high capacity (141&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1) at 1&#160;C with a capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles. Therefore, anchoring boron to manganese&#8208;rich materials inhibits the detrimental structural evolution of deep sodiation and can be used to obtain excellent cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Revealing the Mutually Enhanced Mechanism of Necroptosis and Immunotherapy Induced by Defect Engineering and Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to low immunogenicity&#8208;induced immune escape and short&#8208;term circulating immune responses, the efficiency of immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Therefore, triggering immunogenic cell death and establishing a long&#8208;term, mutually reinforced treatment modality are urgent challenges. In this study, ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with tunable oxygen vacancies (abbreviated as CBNO&#8208;OV1) are prepared for synergistic necroptosis and immunotherapy. The optimized vacancy concentration significantly improves the piezoelectric effect under ultrasound irradiation, thereby considerably improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Density functional theory shows that oxygen vacancies can improve the efficiency of electron hole separation by suppressing their recombination, thus resulting in enhanced piezocatalytic activity. Moreover, the piezoelectric effect improves the permeability of tumor cell membranes, thus resulting in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, CBNO&#8208;OV1 also releases a portion of Ca2+, which induces necroptosis assisted by explosive ROS. Ribonucleic Acid transcription tests suggest the mechanisms associated with immune response activation and necroptosis. More importantly, necroptosis can trigger a significant immune response in vivo, thus activating macrophage M1 polarization through the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway and promoting T&#8208;cell differentiation. TNF&#8208;&#945; differentiated from macrophages conversely promotes necroptosis, thus realizing a mutually enhanced effect. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of mutually reinforced necroptosis and immunotherapy for amplifying tumor efficacy.

         <title>Highly Efficient And Stable ITO&#8208;free Organic Solar Cells Based on Squaraine N&#8208;Doped Quaternary Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and robust device stability remains a significant challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs). Solving this challenge is highly dependent on the film morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive blends; however, there is a lack of rational control strategy. Herein, we show that the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based BHJ can be effectively controlled by a squaraine&#8208;based doping strategy, leading to an increase in device efficiency from 17.26% to 18.5% when doping 2&#160;wt.% squaraine into the PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9:PC71BM ternary BHJ. The efficiency is further improved to 19.11% (certified 19.06%) using an ITO&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity (CPM) architecture. Combined with interfacial modification, CPM quaternary OSC excitingly shows an extrapolated lifetime of &#8764;23 years based on accelerated aging test, with the mechanism behind enhanced stability well studied. Furthermore, a flexible OSC module with a high and stable efficiency of 15.2% and an overall area of 5 cm2 has been successfully fabricated, exhibiting a high average output power for wearable electronics. Our work demonstrates OSCs with new design of BHJ and device architecture are highly promising to be practical relevance with excellent performance and stability.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;driven Non&#8208;metallic Fenton&#8208;active Center Construction for Extensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive cancer therapeutic strategy based on Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, the effectiveness of CDT is subject to the slow kinetic rate and non&#8208;homogeneous distribution of H2O2. In this study, a conceptual non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to enhance CDT efficiency using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO3 (BNBT&#8208;6) nanocrystals. The separated charge carriers under a piezoelectric&#8208;induced electric field synchronize the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O2, which consequently increases hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) yield even under low H2O2 levels. Moreover, acceptor doping induces electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies to facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 and H2O and further promote &#183;OH generation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that BNBT&#8208;6 induces extensive intracellular oxidative stress and enhances cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating necroptosis in addition to the conventional apoptotic pathway. This study proposes a novel design approach for nanomaterials used in CDT and presents a new treatment strategy for apoptosis&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>

Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics and Li anode corrosion etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1200&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41 mAh cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery towards realistic applications.

Abstract
Air electrode is an essential component of air&#8208;demanding energy storage/conversion devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power and stability of the devices. Despite atom&#8208;level modulation in catalyst design being recently achieved, the following air electrodes have received much less attention, causing a stagnation in the development of air&#8208;demanding equipment. This Progress Report begins with the evolution of air electrodes for ZABs and HFCs from the early stages to current requirements. Then, the operation mechanism and the corresponding electrocatalytic mechanisms of ZABs are summarized. In particular, by clarifying the air electrode interfaces of ZABs at different scales, several approaches to improve the air electrode in rechargeable ZABs are reviewed, including the innovative electrode structures and bifunctional oxygen catalysts. Afterwards, we explain the operating mechanisms of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Subsequently, the strategies employed to enhance the efficiency of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs and AEMFCs, respectively, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Last, the prospects for air electrodes in ZABs and HFCs are considered by discussing the main challenges. This Progress Report aims to facilitate the industrialization of ZABs and HFCs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Ni&#8208;Based Layer Double Hydroxides with Enhanced Deprotonation Capability for Efficient Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective and efficient electrooxidation of biomass substrates provides a route forward for the production of sustainable hydrocarbon chemistries and simultaneous green hydrogen. Here, ultrathin NiMn layered double hydroxides are engineered with oxygen defects for the selective conversion of 5&#8208;HMF to 2,5&#8208;FDCA (FE &gt; 90%) well within the oxygen evolution reaction potential window, owing to the catalyst propensity toward deprotonation chemistry.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;based hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for biomass oxidation reactions, supplanting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to lower overpotentials while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. The identification and subsequent engineering of their catalytically active sites are essential to facilitate these anodic reactions. Herein, the proportional relationship between catalysts&#8217; deprotonation propensity and Faradic efficiency of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF)&#8208;to&#8208;2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA,&#160;FEFDCA) is revealed by thorough density functional theory (DFT) simulations and atomic&#8208;scale characterizations, including in situ synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The deprotonation capability of ultrathin layer&#8208;double hydroxides (UT&#8208;LDHs) is regulated by tuning the covalency of metal (M)&#8208;oxygen (O) motifs through defect site engineering and selection of M3+ co&#8208;chemistry. NiMn UT&#8208;LDHs show an ultrahigh FEFDCA of 99% at 1.37&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and retain a high FEFDCA of 92.7% in the OER&#8208;operating window at 1.52&#160;V, about 2&#215; that of NiFe UT&#8208;LDHs (49.5%) at 1.52&#160;V. Ni&#8211;O and Mn&#8211;O motifs function as dual active sites for HMF electrooxidation, where the continuous deprotonation of Mn&#8211;OH sites plays a dominant role in achieving high selectivity while suppressing OER at high potentials. The results showcase a universal concept of modulating competing anodic reactions in aqueous biomass electrolysis by electronically engineering the deprotonation behavior of metal hydroxides, anticipated to be translatable across various biomass substrates.

         <title>Halide&#8208;Driven Synthetic Control of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InSb colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) show promise for extended infrared light sensing applications but face synthesis challenges due to uncontrolled reduction of precursors. Herein, the controlled growth of CQDs is achieved with well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions using zinc halide additives. The photodetectors employing ligand&#8208;exchanged CQDs achieve a 75% external quantum efficiency at 1200&#160;nm with 1&#160;V applied bias.








Abstract
In the III&#8211;V family of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) semiconductors, InSb promises access to a wider range of infrared wavelengths compared to many light&#8208;sensing material candidates. However, achieving the necessary size, size&#8208;dispersity, and optical properties has been challenging. Here the synthetic challenges associated with InSb CQDs are investigated and it is found that uncontrolled reduction of the antimony precursor hampers the controlled growth of CQDs. To overcome this, a synthetic strategy that combines nonpyrophoric precursors with zinc halide additives is developed. The experimental and computational studies show that zinc halide additives decelerate the reduction of the antimony precursor, facilitating the growth of more uniformly sized CQDs. It is also found that the halide choice provides additional control over the strength of this effect. The resultant CQDs exhibit well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions in spectral range of 1.26&#8211;0.98&#160;eV, along with strong photoluminescence. By implementing a postsynthesis ligand exchange, colloidally stable inks enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;quality CQD films are achieved. The first demonstration of InSb CQD photodetectors is presented reaching 75% external quantum efficiency (QE) at 1200&#160;nm, to the knowledge the highest short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) QE reported among heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free infrared CQD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Intrinsic Polarised Electric Field Induces A Storing Mechanism to Achieve Energy Storing Catalysis in V2c MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient storage and separation of holes and electrons pose significant challenges for catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of single&#8208;phase catalysis. Herein, V2C MXene, with its intrinsic polarized electric field, successfully overcomes this obstacle. To enhance hole storage, a multi&#8208;step etching process is employed under reducing conditions to control the content of surface termination groups, thus exposing more defective active sites. The intrinsically polarized electric field confines holes to the surface of the layer and free electrons within the layer, leading to a lag in e&#8208; release compared to h+. The quantities of stored holes and electrons were measured to be 18.13 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1 and 106.37 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1, respectively. Under dark, V2C demonstrates excellent and stable dark&#8208;catalytic performance, degrading 57.91% of tetracycline (TC 40&#160;mg/L) and removing 23% of organic carbon (TOC) after 140 minutes. In simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light, the corresponding degradation rates reached 72.24% and 79.54%, with corresponding TOC removal rates of 49% and 48%, respectively. The hole and electron induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects contribute to a long&#8208;lasting and enhanced broad&#8208;spectrum mineralization of V2C MXene. This study provides valuable insights into the research and application of all&#8208;weather MXene energy storage catalytic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Amorphous Silicon Carbide for Nanomechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized using thin&#8208;film materials under high tensile loads. Although there have been remarkable strides in achieving low&#8208;dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer&#8208;scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 108 at room temperature, the highest value achieved among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free&#8208;standing resonators. This robust thin&#8208;film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin&#8208;film materials in high&#8208;performance&#160;applications.

         <title>Exploring the Synergies of Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence and 2D Materials Coupled by DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating single&#8208;molecule (SM) fluorescence methods with 2D materials by using DNA and related nanostructures as molecular anchors provides significant benefits for both fields: deepening knowledge about the materials while adding information to SM fluorescence experiments. This Perspective delves into the rich interplay, highlights new opportunities for further synergies, and identifies challenges in this cross&#8208;disciplinary venture.








Abstract
The world of 2D materials is steadily growing, with numerous researchers attempting to discover, elucidate, and exploit their properties. Approaches relying on the detection of single fluorescent molecules offer a set of advantages, for instance, high sensitivity and specificity, that allow the drawing of conclusions with unprecedented precision. Herein, it is argued how the study of 2D materials benefits from fluorescence&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule modalities, and vice versa. A special focus is placed on DNA, serving as a versatile adaptor when anchoring single dye molecules to 2D materials. The existing literature on the fruitful combination of the two fields is reviewed, and an outlook on the additional synergies that can be created between them provided.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made White Photothermal Fabrics: A Bridge between Pragmatism and Aesthetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A white composite fabric with an exceptional photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion capability that outperforms ordinary black photothermal fabric is developed. Collective characteristics of shape retention, softness, breathability, light weight, fast&#8208;drying, durability, and tailorability into diverse appearances are integrated into this novel fabric, which promises to satisfy the needs of future advanced garment manufacturing, thermoregulation, and aesthetics.








Abstract
Maintaining human thermal comfort in the cold outdoors is crucial for diverse outdoor activities, e.g., sports and recreation, healthcare, and special occupations. To date, advanced clothes are employed to collect solar energy as a heat source to stand cold climates, while their dull dark photothermal coating may hinder pragmatism in outdoor environments&#160;and visual sense considering fashion. Herein, tailor&#8208;made white webs with strong photothermal effect are proposed. With the embedding of cesium&#8211;tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) nanoparticles (NPs) as additive inside nylon nanofibers, these webs are capable of drawing both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight for heating. Their exceptional photothermal conversion capability enables 2.5&#8211;10.5 &#176;C greater warmth than that of a commercial sweatshirt of six times greater thickness under different climates. Remarkably, this smart fabric can increase its photothermal conversion efficiency in a wet state. It is optimal for fast sweat or water evaporation at human comfort temperature (38.5 &#176;C) under sunlight, and its role in thermoregulation is equally important to avoid excess heat loss in wilderness survival. Obviously, this smart web with considerable merits of shape retention, softness, safety, breathability, washability, and on&#8208;demand coloration provides a revolutionary solution to realize energy&#8208;saving outdoor thermoregulation and simultaneously satisfy the needs of fashion and aesthetics.

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scaffold&#8208;based platform to increase the throughput, reproducibility, and geometric control of 3D organoids is presented. Melt electrowriting is used to generate fibrous scaffolds that guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into a large array of suspended interconnected or discrete organoids. Tuning the geometry of the scaffold enables to control the shape and lumen formation of the emerging tissues.








Abstract
3D organoids are widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low&#8208;throughput culture methods, coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity, restrict the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, melt electrospinning writing is used to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. Grid geometry is shown to be a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high&#8208;throughput screening.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic tetra&#8208;carboxyphenyl&#8208;substituted cobalt phthalocyanine is designed to adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of CoPc/carbon hybrid materials from a molecular perspective. The catalyst maintains effective contact between the active sites and the electrolyte, and achieves efficient CO2RR in both H&#8208;type cell and MEA device with exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability, and structural tunability of the macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). In this work, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to reveal the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. Surprisingly, the resultant electrode exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% for CO2RR with turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in a H&#8208;type cell. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, the boosted transport of water vapor to the catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode, with FECO value of &gt;99% over 27 h at &#8722;0.25 A, representing the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from a molecular perspective.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Frameworks of High Piezovoltage for Sono&#8208;Piezo Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectric Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework (MT&#8208;MOF) of high piezovoltage is designed for new sono&#8208;piezoelectric dynamic therapy with significant antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, the MT&#8208;MOF, which has a piezopotential of 2.9&#160;V, exciting charges under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, not only causes ROS overproduction but also disrupts the polarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes inducing intense cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials produce charges to directly act on cancer medium or promote the generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) for novel tumor therapy triggered by sonography. Currently, piezoelectric sonosensitizers are mainly used to catalyze ROS generation by the band&#8208;tilting effect for sonodynamic therapy. However, it remains a challenge for piezoelectric sonosensitizers to produce high piezovoltages to overcome the bandgap barrier for direct charge generation. Herein, Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework tetragonal nanosheets (MT&#8208;MOF TNS) are designed to produce high piezovoltages for novel sono&#8208;piezo (SP)&#8208;dynamic therapy (SPDT) with remarkable antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS comprise non&#8208;centrosymmetric secondary building units of Mn&#8211;Ti&#8211;oxo cyclic octamers with charge heterogeneous components for piezoelectricity. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS promotes strong sonocavitation to induce piezoelectric effect with a high SP voltage (2.9&#160;V) in situ, to directly excite charges, which is validated by SP&#8208;excited luminescence spectrometry. The SP voltage and charges depolarize the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials and cause ROS overproduction and serious tumor cell damage. Importantly, MT&#8208;MOF TNS can be decorated with targeting molecules and chemotherapeutics for more severe tumor regression by combining SPDT with chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This report develops a fascinating MT&#8208;MOF piezoelectric nano&#8208;semiconductor and provides an efficient SPDT strategy for tumor treatment.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in 2D Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental evidence of the nearly independent single topological flat band (FB) generated by the 2D Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layer&#160;in Nb3TeCl7 with identical on&#8208;site energy of Nb sites is reported. The possibility of modulating the bandwidth, energy position, and topology of the FB by altering the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites in the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome frustrated geometry is disclosed.








Abstract
Flat bands&#160;(FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an aveanue to manipulate FB characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;Derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol&#8208;yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain&#8208;induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain&#8208;induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.








Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8211;0.38&#160;mol%) are reported. The material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP is a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Mechanophore reversion kinetics correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently crosslinked, they are recyclable by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, increasing their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

Shape&#8208;programmable liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane&#8208;based multimode actuators triggered by light&#8208;driven molecular motors are prepared. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved.








Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here, a strategy is reported to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane elastomer by phototriggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. A trifunctional molecular motor modified with an ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light&#8208;responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Molecular Structure and Conformational Design of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers to Enable Predictable Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing integrated experimental and computational methods, it is demonstrated that alterations in the chain conformation of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation with shifts in optical absorption. Moreover, it is revealed that the combined effect of chain conformation and the alignment of molecular orbital energy between donor and acceptor units influence the ultimate optical bandgap of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers.








Abstract
Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers (D&#8208;A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices. However, there remains a critical challenge in precise control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, D&#8208;A CPs with different acceptor units are explored that show an opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy, it is found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D&#8208;A CPs. For polymers with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for polymers with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding of the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D&#8208;A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates bioinspired microstructured thermoresponsive hydrogels for soft actuators with enhanced actuation performance and options for both light&#8208; and electrically controlled actuation. The poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels contain interconnected microtubular graphene networks for enhanced water transport, resulting in increased actuation dynamics and stresses without compromising the softness and mechanical stability of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8776;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here it is shown, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8776;400% and actuation stress by &#8776;4000% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically powered actuation. It is anticipated that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and 2D materials, paving the way toward designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>A Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation toward Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation with visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared selective absorption for camouflage, motivated by the butterfly scales with broadband reflection splitting effect. This work not only widens the working wavebands compared to the conventional materials but also opens a bioinspired way to improve the multispectral performance of wave&#8208;functional metamaterials.








Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR), along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and a SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultralow specular reflectance (average of 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8211;1.6&#160;&#181;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m and 10.6&#160;&#181;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum of 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under a thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performance and Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive random&#8208;access memory based on high&#8208;entropy oxide exhibits excellent performance, such as low power consumption, long retention time, and excellent endurance. The excellent properties are due to the interactions among the five metal cations and the entropy stabilization effect. The switching behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt.








Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive&#8208;switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillation of Thermoplasmonic Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oscillation is the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus. A new self&#8208;oscillator model is presented in which photoactive plasmonic nanoparticles display periodic clustering under non&#8208;periodic illumination. The surface temperature of nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at infrasonic/acoustic frequencies. Further mathematical extension of the model suggests the emergence of a thermoplasmonic attractor.








Abstract
Self&#8208;oscillation&#8212;the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus&#8212;is vital for creating low&#8208;maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self&#8208;oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self&#8208;oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the&#160;theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self&#8208;oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light&#8208;propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf&#8211;Poincar&#233;&#8211;Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and&#160;chaos.

         <title>Effective Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Regeneration of Intervertebral Discs Using 3D Porous Hybrid Protein Nanoscaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective modulation of inflammation requires sustainable and dynamic blockades of diverse inflammatory mediators. A 3D porous hybrid protein nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic strategy is developed to inhibit pro&#8208;inflammatory reactive oxygen species, cf nucleic acids, and regulate epigenetics in immune cells. This strategy robustly suppresses inflammation in vivo, promotes tissue regeneration, and reduces pain signaling after intervertebral disc injuries.








Abstract
Degeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissues is often associated with complex pro&#8208;inflammatory factors. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cf&#8208;NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoscaffold&#8208;based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D&#8208;PHP) self&#8208;therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial&#8208;templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release, disc&#8208;mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme&#8208;like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf&#8208;NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long&#8208;term pain reduction. Therefore, self&#8208;therapeutic and epigenetic modulator&#8208;encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis yield of 2D Na2Cl crystals with unconventional stoichiometries in a graphene membrane can be significantly improved by applying a negative potential. Such high content can substantially improve the physical performance of the abnormal Na2Cl crystals. These findings represent a step toward the potential applications of abnormal 2D crystal materials with unique properties.








Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cells, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only &lt;1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries is reported, which is achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. A more than tenfold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals is obtained using a potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates a unique piezoelectric behavior arising from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increases from 0 to &#8776;180&#160;mV in the broad 0&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8211;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>A Nano&#8208;Biohybrid&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate the Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell capable of absorbing a broad range of visible wavelengths and generating an amplified photocurrent density is developed to verify the possibility of its biomedical application. The electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction are regulated precisely by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell upon light irradiation.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells are studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications. However, they are composed of light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules with narrow absorption wavelengths and weak transient photocurrent generation. In this study, a nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell composed of bacteriorhodopsin, chlorophyllin, and Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles is developed to overcome the current limitations and verify the possibility of biomedical applications. Bacteriorhodopsin and chlorophyllin are introduced as light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules to broaden the absorption wavelength. As a photocatalyst, Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles are introduced to generate a photocurrent and amplify the photocurrent generated by the biomolecules. The developed bio&#8208;solar cell absorbs a broad range of visible wavelengths and generates an amplified stationary photocurrent density (152.6&#160;nA&#160;cm&#8722;2) with a long lifetime (up to 1&#160;month). Besides, the electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions are precisely regulated by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell, indicating that the bio&#8208;solar cell can control living cells by signal transmission through other types of living cells. The proposed nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell can be used as a sustainable and biocompatible energy source for the development of wearable and implantable biodevices and bioelectronic medicines for humans.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#9472;C Bonds achieving Long Cycle Life of an Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3, endowing an Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;Carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>

ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are constructed via a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, can carry Doxorubicin (DOX) to penetrate blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and target inflamed brain tumors. It can improve the anticancer efficacy of DOX, significantly reducing side effects. Meanwhile, this work indicates that the nanoplatform may offer great promise for targeted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) chemotherapy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are&#160;constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) do not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which can cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. These engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles show better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted into different targeting ligands and packed into different drugs, and they may serve as unique and efficient nanoplatforms for drug delivery and tumor promise therapy.

         <title>Photothermal&#8211;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in an Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting under Optical&#8211;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the corresponding optical and magnetic design of Co3O4/CoFe2O4@NF, its resistance is reduced from 16 &#937; to 7&#160;&#937; under an optical&#8211;magnetic field (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mT). Furthermore, spin polarization occurs inducing the parallel alignment of oxygen atoms and the formation of paramagnetic triplet oxygen, reducing the reaction energy barrier, and improving the kinetics of the OER reaction. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in the optical&#8211;magnetic field is only 172.4&#160;mV, achieving a &#916;&#951; of 76.51&#160;mV.








Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on the OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve the OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, a strategy is proposed for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8211;magnetic field, and the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement is studied. Under the optical&#8211;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 to 7.0&#160;&#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8211;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Modulation on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual defect engineering strategy is developed to simultaneously create tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects. These defects in a Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and oxygen intermediate p&#8208;orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as&#8208;synthesized Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar&#8208;driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.

When loaded on a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar-driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD-Ni-NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin-dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD-Ni-NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive and Fast&#8208;Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm&#8208;shifting mold&#8208;free manufacturing is demonstrated for high&#8208;sensitivity and ultrafast responsive sensors using sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;m 3D&#8208;printing and conformal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymers. Much&#8208;enhanced sensing performance is achieved, compared to those manufactured with mold&#8208;based techniques, due to the high electrical conductivity of the sensing element, oxidative CVD&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene), and the benefits from the multiscale (from micrometer&#160;to millimeter) patterns.








Abstract
A new manufacturing paradigm is showcased to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. This mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D&#8208;printed multiscale microstructures as the substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

         <title>Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S11, S22, and M11 excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (metallic CNTs), respectively are found, for 1.8&#160;&#181;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor are determined, verifying the macroscopically 1D nature of the films. Finally, polarized THG imaging is performed to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic&#8208;Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes Over Pd/C3N4 Through Dual Regulation of Nitrogen Defects and the Mott&#8211;Schottky Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schottky catalyst&#160;of Pd nanoparticles supported on graphite&#8208;like C3N4 with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN), &#160;containing a large number of cyano groups, is reported. The catalyst exhibits higher reactivity and selectivity in the selective transfer hydrogenation of alkynes under visible light.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite&#8208;like C3N4 structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) are synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN are superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C3N4 without nitrogen defects) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations show that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN can change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reaches 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improve the visible&#8208;light response and accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibits higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&#8722;1. This TOF is five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all&#8208;silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 210 or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid&#8208;infrared further promise the high&#8208;capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.








Abstract
The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous&#8208;spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.

Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta-atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta-atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous-spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof-of-concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &amp;gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Screen&#8208;printed flexible humidity sensors based on hexagonal tungsten oxide nanowires exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, and fast response in a wide relative humidity range, showing great potential in respiration rate monitoring, medicine packaging state monitoring, and non&#8208;contact measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the humidity sensors can be adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode.








Abstract
The utilization of printing techniques for the development of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors holds immense significance for various applications in the fields of the Internet of Things, agriculture, human healthcare, and storage environments. However, the long response time and low sensitivity of current printed humidity sensors limit their practical applications. Herein, a series of high&#8208;sensing&#8208;performance flexible resistive&#8208;type humidity sensors is fabricated by the screen&#8208;printing method, and hexagonal tungsten oxide (h&#8208;WO3) is employed as the humidity&#8208;sensing material due to its low cost, strong chemical adsorption ability, and excellent humidity&#8208;sensing ability. The as&#8208;prepared printed sensors exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, outstanding flexibility, low hysteresis, and fast response (1.5&#160;s) in a wide relative humidity (RH) range (11&#8211;95%&#160;RH). Furthermore, the sensitivity of humidity sensors can be easily adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode to meet the diverse requirements of specific applications. The printed flexible humidity sensors possess immense potential in various applications, including wearable devices, non&#8208;contact measurements, and packaging opening state monitoring.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Platelet Lysates Proteins into Microparticles by Unnatural Disulfide Bonds for Bottom&#8208;Up Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins from human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs) produce microparticles by forming unnatural disulfide bonds (&#8211;S&#8211;S&#8211;). In this study, protein&#8208;based microparticles are produced with defined surface topography and tunable size using a direct, simple, and low&#8208;cost methodology. These bioactive microstructures allow cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form and have applications in bottom&#8208;up approaches.








Abstract
There is a demand to design microparticles holding surface topography while presenting inherent bioactive cues for applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields. Using the pool of proteins present in human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs), the production of protein&#8208;based microparticles via a simple and cost&#8208;effective method is reported, exploring the prone redox behavior of cysteine (Cy&#8208;SH) amino acid residues. The forced formation of new intermolecular disulfide bonds results in the precipitation of the proteins as spherical, pompom&#8208;like microparticles with adjustable sizes (15&#8211;50&#160;&#181;m in diameter) and surface topography consisting of grooves and ridges. These PL microparticles exhibit extraordinary cytocompatibility, allowing cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form, while also working as injectable systems for cell support. Early studies also suggest that the surface topography provided by these PL microparticles can support osteogenic behavior. Consequently, these PL microparticles may find use to create live tissues via bottom&#8208;up procedures or injectable tissue&#8208;defect fillers, particularly for bone regeneration, with the prospect of working under xeno&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>An H2O&#8208;Initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Reinforced High&#8208;Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crosslinking strategy where metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator is proposed. After incorporating a high concentration of plasticizers, the polymer&#8208;in&#8208;plasticizer solid electrolyte still maintains outstanding mechanical properties, thus demonstrating fast lithium&#8208;conduction kinetics and effective inhibition of lithium dendrites simultaneously.








Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate conduction of ions in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, a novel crosslinking strategy, wherein metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator, is proposed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, trimethylaluminum (TMA)&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8211;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10&#160;000 to 8&#160;000&#160;000&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance toward Li metal (48.1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2), and a wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.8&#160;V vs Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C&#160;=&#160;170&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Reconstructed Hierarchically Structured Keratin Fibers with Shape&#8208;Memory Features Based on Reversible Secondary&#8208;Structure Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose via wet&#8208;spinning in a more cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The reconfiguration of the keratin secondary structure is proposed as the mechanism of the water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory effect. The smart keratin fibers show the potential to be applied as artificial muscles.








Abstract
Biocompatible and biodegradable shape&#8208;memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, the possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape&#8208;memory performance to other hydration&#8208;responsive materials, with a shape&#8208;fixity ratio of 94.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.15% and a shape&#8208;recovery rate of 81.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.84%. Owing to their well&#8208;preserved secondary structure and cross&#8208;linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water&#8208;stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape&#8208;memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net&#8208;points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.

This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape-memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net-points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water-triggered shape-memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive, and Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel with a double&#8208;network architecture is created from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer self&#8208;assembly peptide. Its strong tissue adhesion facilitates excellent integration in the host and demonstrates self&#8208;healing feature. The novel hydrogel demonstrates a strong capability of promoting exuberant neural regeneration after spinal cord injury and consequently promotes sensory and motor functions, particularly protecting the urinary system.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffolds show promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI is developed. The hydrogel is composed of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to conventional hydrogels, this hydrogel ensures a significant promotion of immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries are enhanced, including motor function, sensory function, and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, this proposed hydrogel represents an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>A Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid&#8208;state films, which leads to low charge&#8208;transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy orders the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that are incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals are redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which is found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both the PM6 and the L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 nm&#8208;thick and 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick photoactive layer, respectively.

A self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem is decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) for delivering small interfering RNA to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1, generating simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 interaction with blockage on tumor growth. This study highlights the potential of the dendrimer platform for elaborating combined and precision therapy.








Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. Here an effective strategy is reported for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is established for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1 (PDK1), a kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem, named PPD, is designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer&#8208;specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively generates simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of the tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside a unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Circular Reprocessing of Thermoset Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt&#8208;reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low&#8208;density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as&#8208;synthesized polyurethane foams.








Abstract
Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross&#8208;linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt&#8208;processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low&#8208;density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as&#8208;synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.

A structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 to improve the reaction kinetics and cycling stability for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D NiBi3 with metallic conductivity and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers high&#8208;rate capability and superior cycling performance for Na/K storage.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na&#8208;ion and K&#8208;ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K&#8208;storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting&#160;2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high&#8208;rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g&#8722;1) after 15&#160;000 cycles for Na&#8208;ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K&#8208;storage reaction mechanisms and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high&#8208;performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Embedded with Iodine for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) is demonstrated as an electroactive cathode material for advanced NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. Benefiting from excellent electrical conductivity, abundant Cu&#9472;O4 species, and adsorbed iodide at the Cu sites of the Cu&#8208;HHB/I2, an assembled NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver a superior energy density (31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2) and record&#8208;long cycling lifetime (89.5% after 10&#160;000 cycles).








Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, a 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine, as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors, is reported. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#9472;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the Cu&#9472;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with a porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;Doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memcapacitive&#8208;synapse&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) system is reported. The device's intrinsic property matches the dynamics of multisensory information processing. A touchless user interface (TUI) for a virtual shopping system is demonstrated, benefitting from the robustness and versatility of such a device, which is of profound implication for energy&#8208;efficient human&#8722;computer interface and edge computing apparatus.








Abstract
Hardware implementation tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but have not been experimentally exploited yet. Here, this work&#160;reports an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could originate from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium&#8208;oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8776;113.4 fJ per spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power&#8208;efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>Generation of Terahertz Radiation via the Transverse Thermoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense terahertz radiation generation via the transverse thermoelectric effect in layered conducting transition metal oxides is demonstrated . Ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, induced by femtosecond laser pulses on thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents leading to efficient THz emission. This approach offers a simple and promising avenue for versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful tool with widespread applications ranging from imaging, sensing, and broadband communications to spectroscopy and nonlinear control of materials. Future progress in THz technology depends on the development of efficient, structurally simple THz emitters that can be implemented in advanced miniaturized devices. Here, it is shown how the natural electronic anisotropy of layered conducting transition metal oxides enables the generation of intense terahertz radiation via the transverse thermoelectric effect. In thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, femtosecond laser pulses generate ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, which in turn launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents, thus allowing efficient emission of the resulting THz field out of the film structure. This scheme is demonstrated in experiments on thin films of the layered metals PdCoO2 and La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, and model calculations that elucidate the influence of the material parameters on the intensity and spectral characteristics of the emitted THz field are presented. Due to its simplicity, the method opens up a promising avenue for the development of highly versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.

         <title>Photoinduced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical cloaking in microgels: a diarylethene photoswitch is introduced as a co&#8208;crosslinker into PVCL microgels. Light&#8208;induced photoswitching of the diaryethene results in a phase&#8208;transition shift and thus changes the swelling status of microgels at a fixed temperature, rendering them differently reactive to mechanical force.








Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as a crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase&#8208;transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8211;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated by the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photoinduced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Based Selective Emitters for Thermophotovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior oxidation resistance of Ir, having a low Gibbs energy of oxide formation, in an Ir/HfO2&#8208;based selective emitter at 1000&#160;&#176;C over 100&#160;h at 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar is demonstrated in comparison to refractory W, in a W/HfO2 selective emitter. 6 layers of Ir are stable after annealing, whereas W layers vanish due to oxidation and sublimation.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operation of refractory&#8208;metal&#8208;based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here, the use of the noble metal Ir is proposed, which is stable to oxidation and has optical properties comparable to gold. The thermal endurance of Ir in a 3&#8208;layer&#8208;system, consisting of HfO2/Ir/HfO2, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#160;&#176;C in a pressure range from 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar, is demonstrated. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in a vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#160;&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO2 layers. An in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction experimental comparison between 1D multilayered Ir/HfO2 and W/HfO2 selective emitters annealed at 1000&#160;&#176;C, 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar, over 100&#160;h, confirms oxidation stability of Ir while W multilayers gradually disappear. The results of this work show that W&#8208;based metamaterials are not long&#8208;term stable even at 1000&#160;&#176;C. However, the oxidation resistance of Ir can be leveraged for refractory plasmonic metamaterials, such as selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic systems with strong suppression of long wavelength radiation.

         <title>Customized Microenvironments Spontaneously Facilitate Coupled Engineering of Real&#8208;Life Large&#8208;Scale Clean Water Capture and Pollution Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of drinking water directly from contaminated seawater is proposed. The strategy is based on a novel coupling perspective (parallel reaction space) to achieve photocatalytic degradation of pollutants while capturing clean water. It is demonstrated that this evaporator (CCMs&#8208;x) is widely adaptable and persistent to multiple real&#8208;life scenarios with excellent scalability. This work makes it crucial to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism and gain insight into the performance of catalytic materials at the microscopic level.








Abstract
Harnessing abundant renewable resources and pollutants on a large scale to address environmental challenges, while providing sustainable freshwater, is a significant endeavour. This study presents the design of fully functional solar vaporization devices (SVD) based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposites (CCMs&#8208;x). These devices exhibit efficient photothermal properties that facilitate multitargeted interfacial reactions, enabling simultaneous catalysis of sewage and desalination. The localized interfacial heating generated by the photothermal effect of CCMs&#8208;x triggers surface&#8208;dominated catalysis and steam generation. The CCMs&#8208;x SVD achieves a solar water&#8208;vapor generation rate of 1.41&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (90.8%), and it achieves over 95% removal of pollutants within 60&#160;min under one&#8208;sun for practical application. The exceptional photothermal conversion rate of wastewater for environmental remediation and water capture is attributed to customized microenvironments within the system. The integrated parallel reaction system in SVD ensures it is a real&#8208;life application in multiple scenarios such as municipal/medical wastewater and brine containing high concentrations. Additionally, the SVD exhibits long&#8208;term durability, antifouling functionality toward complex ionic contaminants. This study not only demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds strategy for large&#8208;scale direct production of potable water from polluted seawater, but also opens up exciting possibilities for parallel production of energy and water resources.

         <title>Giant Atomic Swirl in Graphene Bilayers with Biaxial Heterostrain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial heterostrain in bilayer graphene leads to a new atomic lattice relaxation to minimize the stacking energy. Elastic energy is stored in solitons hosting topological states. This demonstrates that heterostrain can be an additional tuning parameter in moir&#233; materials opening new possibilities for moir&#233; engineering.








Abstract
The study of moir&#233; engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in which stacking 2D layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir&#233; pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it&#160;was&#160;found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly&#8208;correlated&#8208;electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. A twist is now routinely used to adjust the properties of 2D materials. This study investigates a new type of moir&#233; superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other&#8212;so&#8208;called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry&#8208;breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight&#8208;binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Brightens Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known concentration quenching phenomenon is intrinsically suppressed in sensitized luminescent systems by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, thereby unlocking the full potential of sensitization strategy in enhancing photoexcitation efficiency of doped luminescent materials and providing a new approach to achieve high&#8208;purity sensitized luminescence.








Abstract
The brightness of doped luminescent materials is usually limited by the ubiquitous concentration quenching phenomenon resulting in an intractable tradeoff between internal quantum efficiency and excitation efficiency. Here, an intrinsic suppression of concentration quenching in sensitized luminescent systems, by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, is reported. Although Cr3+ sensitizers and trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+, Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) emitters themselves are highly susceptible to concentration quenching, the unprecedentedly high&#8208;brightness luminescence of Cr3+&#8211;Ln3+ systems is demonstrated in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) range employing high concentrations of Cr3+, whereby a record photoelectric efficiency of 23% is achieved for SWIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is about twice as high as those previously reported. The results underscore the beneficial role of emitters in terminating excitation energies, opening up a new dimension for developing efficient sensitized luminescent materials.

         <title>Tuning the Organ Tropism of Polymersome for Spleen&#8208;Selective Nanovaccine Delivery to Boost Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>

A well&#8208;designed polymersome library reveals specific organ selectivity to the liver and spleen. With the advanced tailoring of splenic immune responses, spleen targeting nanovaccine can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non&#8208;specific distribution in non&#8208;targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver&#8208; and spleen&#8208;selective delivery is reported. By using a library screening approach, spleen&#8208;targeted polymersome PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 and liver&#8208;targeted polymersome PA9&#8208;ZP3&#8208;5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. O ur findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 is employed as a systemic nanocarrier to co&#8208;deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ&#8208;selective delivery and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Modulating the d&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt3Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H2O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.








Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotentials (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m&#160;H2SO4, 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;m phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Catalyst for Green Ammonia Synthesis from Ubiquitous Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni applying to plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from air and water is proposed, with which a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent FE of 96.8% can be obtained. Moreover, the reaction system is enlarged and the generated NH3 precipitates into MgNH4PO4&#183;6H2O solid to promote the practical application.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is essential for modern agriculture and industry, and, due to its high hydrogen density and no carbon emission, it is also expected to be the next&#8208;generation of &#8220;clean&#8221; energy carrier. Herein, directly from air and water, a plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic reaction system for NH3 production, which combines two steps of plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and electrochemical NOx&#8722; reduction reaction (eNOxRR) with a bifunctional catalyst, is successfully established. Especially, the bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni can simultaneously promote plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and eNOxRR processes. The easy adsorption and activation of O2 by CuCo2O4/Ni greatly improve the NOx&#8722; production rate at the first step. Further, CuCo2O4/Ni can also resolve the overbonding of the key intermediate of *NO, and thus reduce the energy barrier of the second step of eNOxRR. Finally, the &#8220;green&#8221; NH3 production achieves excellent FENH3 (96.8%) and record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with large partial current density (1384.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, an enlarged self&#8208;made H&#8208;type electrolyzer improves the NH3 yield to 3.6&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1, and the obtained NH3 is then rapidly converted to a solid of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, which favors the easy storage and transportation of NH3.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Interchain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;featured non&#8208;conjugated polymers with largely enhanced thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance are demonstrated, in which a secondary phosphine oxide acceptor is introduced to balance intra&#8208; and interchain charge transfer for radiation facilitation and non&#8208;radiation suppression, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 30%, respectively.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT can markedly improve performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this work, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by way of a series of non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing a 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO)&#8208;based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve balanced intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT by accurately optimizing the inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. The DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. This demonstrates that, compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT&#8208;based copolymers for radiation, and suppress singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photocontrolled Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared using a commodity polyacrylonitrile and reversible crosslinker via reversible metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The thermosets are mechanically robust, and they are recyclable via reversible coordination upon light irradiation in a solvent and heating. This reversible coordination method enables the preparation of recyclable materials using other commodity polymers and polymer composites. The thermosets can be recycled from plastic waste.








Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed in over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. In this work, recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8211;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. In addition, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be de&#8208;crosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. The preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as poly(styrene&#8208;coacrylonitrile) (SAN) resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking is also demonstrated. This study shows that reversible crosslinking via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

Hydrogel Soft Actuators
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap between rigid machines interacting with soft matter. In article number 2302816, Rainer Adelung, Fabian Sch&#252;tt, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the incorporation of a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix dramatically enhances actuation performance, thereby overcoming water&#8208;transport limitations in hydrogel soft actuators while providing options for both light&#8208; and electrically&#8208;controlled actuation.

Mechanical Microgel Cloaking
Concepts to control mechanical polymer degradation on demand are one possible pathway toward a sustainable polymer future. In article 2305845, Robert G&#246;stl and co&#8208;workers gate the mechanochemical degradation of microgels as prototypical material platform by light. The observed mechanical cloaking effect is caused by a photoinduced phase transition, hence operates on the polymer topology level, and might be universally applicable.

Resistive Switching
In article number 2302979, Wen&#8208;Wei Wu and co&#8208;workers systematically investigate the resistive&#8208;switching performance and mechanisms of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO)&#8208;based memristors. The SET/RESET behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt. This novel high&#8208;performance resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) device paves a new avenue toward memristors and holds great potential for various applications.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip, Organoids, and Biohybrid Robotics</title>

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in in vitro neuromuscular junction models with 2D and 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robots, and introduces the related derivative techniques for functional analysis and stimulus methods, their application as disease models and for drug screening, and prospects for their future development and related challenges.








Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. Related derivative techniques are introduced for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases are summarized and their future development trends and challenges are discussed.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next&#8208;generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.








Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns.

     alt="Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next-generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high-end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light-induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer-scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high-resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Bioceramics: Combination of Diagnosis, Therapy, and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourth generation of bioceramics called colored/oxygen&#8208;deficient for biomedical applications are introduced in this review. The importance of this class of bioceramics can be defined through multifunctionality since they are regarded as the connection between the past and future. The microstructure, applications, potential challenges, future trends, and perspectives are discussed in detail.








Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>Digital Manufacturing of Functional Ready&#8208;to&#8208;Use Microfluidic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital manufacturing of functional microfluidic systems is introduced in the form of structurally encoded, self&#8208;powered capillaric circuits (CC), thanks to new hydrophilic inks. Monolithic CCs are 3D printed with design innovations including circular cross&#8208;sections, embedded stop valves, and gyroid capillary pumps. Programmable liquid handling via retention burst valves and microfluidic chain reactions are shown and applied to an immunoassay.








Abstract
Digital manufacturing (DM) holds great potential for microfluidics, but requirements for embedded conduits and high resolution beyond the capability of common manufacturing equipment, and microfluidic systems' dependence on peripheralshave limited its adoption. Capillaric circuits (CCs) are structurally encoded, self&#8208;contained microfluidic systems that operate and self&#8208;fill via precisely tailored hydrophilicity. CCs &#160;are&#160; heretofore hydrophilized in a plasma chamber, but which offers only transient hydrophilicity, lacks reproducibility, and limits CC design to open surface channels subsequently sealed with tape. Here, the additive DM of monolithic, fully functional, and intrinsically hydrophilic CCs is reported. CCs are 3D printed with commonly available light&#8208;engine&#8208;based 3D printers using poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate&#8208;based ink co&#8208;polymerized with hydrophilic acrylic acid crosslinkers and optimized for hydrophilicity and printability. A new, robust capillary valve design and embedded conduits with circular cross&#8208;sections that prevent bubble trapping are presented, interwoven circuit architectures created, and CC use illustrated with an immunoassay. Finally, the external paper capillary pumps are eliminated by directly embedding the capillary pump in the chip as a porous gyroid structure, realizing fully functional, monolithic CCs. Thence, a digital file can be made into a CC by commonly available 3D printers in less than 30&#160;min enabling low&#8208;cost, distributed DM of fully functional ready&#8208;to&#8208;use microfluidic systems.

         <title>Light Sheet&#8208;based Laser Patterning Bioprinting Produces Long&#8208;term Viable Full&#8208;thickness Skin Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue engineering holds great promise for biomedical research and healthcare, offering alternatives to animal models and enabling tissue regeneration and organ transplantation. Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bioprinting stands out for its design flexibility and reproducibility. Here, we present an integrated fluorescent light sheet bioprinting and imaging system that combines high printing speed (0.66 mm3/s) and resolution (9&#160;&#956;m) with light sheet&#8208;based imaging. This approach employs direct laser patterning and a static light sheet for confined voxel crosslinking in photocrosslinkable materials. The developed bioprinter enables real&#8208;time monitoring of hydrogel crosslinking using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and brightfield imaging as well as in situ light sheet imaging of cells. Human fibroblasts encapsulated in a thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry&#8208;based hydrogel exhibited high viability (83% &#177; 4.34%) and functionality. Furthermore, full&#8208;thickness skin constructs displayed characteristics of both epidermal and dermal layers and remained viable for 41 days. The integrated approach demonstrates the capabilities of light sheet bioprinting, offering high speed, resolution, and real&#8208;time characterization. Future enhancements involving solid&#8208;state laser scanning devices such as acousto&#8208;optic deflectors and modulators will further enhance resolution and speed, opening new opportunities in light&#8208;based bioprinting and advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Unlocking The Power of Multicatalytic Synergistic Transformation: Towards Environmentally Adaptable Organohydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A sustainable and efficient multicatalytic chemical transformation approach is devised for the development of all&#8208;biobased environmentally adaptable polymers and gels with multifunctional properties. The catalytic system, utilizing Lignin aluminum nanoparticles (AlNPs&#8208;Al3+), synergistically combines multiple catalytic cycles to create robust, mechanically stable, and versatile organohydrogels. Single catalytic cycles alone fail to achieve desired results, highlighting the importance of cooperatively combining different cycles for successful outcomes. The transformation involves free radical crosslinking, reversible quinone&#8208;catechol reactions, and an autocatalytic mechanism, resulting in a dual crosslinking strategy that incorporates both covalent and ionic crosslinking. This approach creates a dynamic gel system with combined energy dissipation and storage mechanisms. The engineered organohydrogels demonstrate vital multifunctionalities such as good thermal stability, self&#8208;healing, and adhesive properties, flame&#8208;retardancy, mechanical resilience and durability, conductivity, viscoelastic properties, environmental adaptability, and resistance to extreme conditions such as freezing and drying. The developed catalytic technology and resulting gels hold significant potential for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, actuators, and sensors.

         <title>Metal Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticle Supercrystals: From Photoactivation of Hydrogen Evolution to Photocorrosion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of plasmonic supercrystals made of Ag@Pt nanoparticles is monitored through operando nanobubble imaging by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy. The degradation mechanisms following light irradiation are investigated at the single supercrystal and nanoparticle level by correlative microscopy and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8211;electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively.








Abstract
Gas nanobubbles are directly linked to many important chemical reactions. While they can be detrimental to operational devices, they also reflect the local activity at the nanoscale. Here, supercrystals made of highly monodisperse Ag@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles are first grown onto a solid support and fully characterized by electron microscopies and X&#8208;ray scattering. Supercrystals are then used as a plasmonic photocatalytic platform for triggering the hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high&#8208;resolution optical microscopy, which allows gas nanobubble nucleation to be probed at the early stage with high temporal resolution and the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them to be quantified. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy help to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.

The catalytic activity is measured operando at the single supercrystal level by high-resolution optical microscopy, which allows gas nanobubble nucleation to be probed at the early stage with high temporal resolution and the amount of gas molecules trapped inside them to be quantified. Finally, a correlative microscopy approach and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy help to decipher the mechanisms at the origin of the local degradation of the supercrystals during catalysis, namely nanoscale erosion and corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiral&#8208;Structured Dielectric Polymers Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers are demonstrated to avoid the electronic conjugation of the polymer chain while maintaining a decent thermal stability, as inspired by the double helix structure of DNA, leading to ultrahigh energy density of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
The growing need for high&#8208;power and compact&#8208;size energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems demands polymer film capacitors with excellent temperature capability. However, conventional polymer dielectrics feature dramatic deterioration in capacitive performance under concurrent high temperature and electric field because the high thermal stability traditionally relies on the conjugated, planar molecular segments in the polymer chains. Herein, inspired by the stable double helix structures of deoxyribonucleic acid, spiral&#8208;structured dielectric polymers that exhibit simultaneous high thermal stability and great capacitive performance are demonstrated. Both the experimental results and computational simulations confirm that the spiral groups serve to weaken the electrostatic molecular interaction, induce proper molecular chain stacking structure, and regulate the charge transfer process by breaking the conjugated planes and introducing deep trap sites. The resultant polymer exhibits the maximum discharged energy densities of 7.29 and 6.13 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency above 90% at 150 and 200&#160;&#176;C, respectively, more than ten times those of the original dielectric at the same conditions. Here a completely new dimension is offered for the molecular design of polymers, giving rise to well&#8208;balanced thermal and dielectric properties, and ultimately the desired capacitive energy storage performance at high temperatures.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Inspired Electro&#8208;Responsive Lubricating Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive lubricating hydrogel is developed based on the synergy of electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular non&#8208;covalent silk fibroin and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer network. It demonstrates partial gel&#8208;sol transition under the electric field to regulate the lubricating property.








Abstract
Enabling the living capability of secreting liquids dynamically triggered by external stimuli while maintaining the bulk frame is a significant challenge for mucosa&#8208;inspired hydrogels. A mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed in this study using the synergy between electro&#8208;responsive silk fibroin supramolecular non&#8208;covalent networks and covalent polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol polymer networks. The formed supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel exhibits a partial gel&#8208;sol transition upon the application of an electric field, and the liquid layer on the hydrogel surface near the cathode is used to mimic the mucus&#8208;secreting capability to regulate lubrication. The electro&#8208;responsive lubricating process can operate under a safe voltage and exhibits good reversibility. It is also a universal strategy to construct an electro&#8208;responsive hydrogel by introducing an electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular network into the polymer network. This mucosa&#8208;inspired electro&#8208;responsive supramolecular&#8208;covalent hydrogel offers a promising method for designing soft actuators or robots that can regulate lubrication using an electric strategy.

         <title>Enriching Metal&#8211;Oxygen Species and Phosphate Modulating of Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface PO43&#8208; anions modulate the local microenvironment with abundant K+ ions and accelerate the formation of metal&#8211;oxygen species, optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts, and inhibit the side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus delivering a high jHCOO&#8722; of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. The activity of CO2RR is influenced deeply by the reaction microenvironment and electronic properties of the catalysts. Herein, the surface PO43&#8722; anions are tuned to modulate the local microenvironment and the electronic properties of the indium&#8208;based catalyst with abundant metal&#8211;oxygen species enabling efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Indium nanoparticles coupled with PO43&#8722; anions (PO43&#8722;&#8208;In NPs) achieve a high selectivity of HCOO&#8722; up to 91.4% at a low potential of &#8722;0.98&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE) and a high HCOO&#8722; partial current density of 279.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE in the electrochemical flow cell. In&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ characterizations confirm the PO43&#8722; anions keep stable on the surface of indium during CO2RR, accelerating the generation of OCHO* intermediate. From density functional theory calculations, PO43&#8722; anions enrich the metal&#8211;oxygen species on the substrate to optimize the electronic structure of the catalysts and induce a local microenvironment with massive K+ ions on the interface, thus reducing the activation energy barrier of CO2RR.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Configurable MXene&#8208;Based Thermoacoustic Loudspeakers with Tunable Sound Directivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MXene thermoacoustic loudspeakers with the capability of shape configurations provide directivity&#8208;tunable and high sound generation under different mechanical deformations. MXene conductors with low heat&#8208;capacity&#8208;per&#8208;unit&#8208;area and parylene substrates with low thermal effusivity enable bidirectional and stable sound in concave/convex, on&#8208;needle, folded, and twisted configurations. High conformability can be affixed to diverse 3D&#160;surfaces, enabling focused and omnidirectional sound generation.








Abstract
Film&#8208;type shape&#8208;configurable speakers with tunable sound directivity are in high demand for wearable electronics. Flexible, thin thermoacoustic (TA) loudspeakers&#8212;which are free from bulky vibrating diaphragms&#8212;show promise in this regard. However, configuring thin TA loudspeakers into arbitrary shapes is challenging because of their low sound pressure level (SPL) under mechanical deformations and low conformability to other surfaces. By carefully controlling the heat capacity per unit area and thermal effusivity of an MXene conductor and substrates, respectively, it fabricates an ultrathin MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeaker exhibiting high SPL output (74.5&#160;dB at 15&#160;kHz) and stable sound performance for 14 days. Loudspeakers with the parylene substrate, whose thickness is less than the thermal penetration depth, generated bidirectional and deformation&#8208;independent sound in bent, twisted, cylindrical, and stretched&#8208;kirigami configurations. Furthermore, it constructs parabolic and spherical versions of ultrathin, large&#8208;area (20&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;20&#160;cm) MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeakers, which display sound&#8208;focusing and 3D omnidirectional&#8208;sound&#8208;generating attributes, respectively.

Strategically doped Cu and oxygen vacancies introduce defect&#8208;driven opto&#8208;critical phases in WO3&#183;H2O via a one&#8208;pot, photo&#8208;induced submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). This innovative method fabricates uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;doped WO3&#183;H2O nanocrystals, revealing an all&#8208;solar response across photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics, directing future design of advanced oxide materials.








Abstract
Materials imbued with uniformly dispersed, photo&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are instrumental in sustainable energy and photonic applications. Conventional methods, however, constrain their all&#8208;solar response. An innovative alternative is proposed: submerged photo&#8208;synthesis of crystallites (SPsC). It is shown that strategic doping with copper and oxygen vacancies can induce opto&#8208;critical phases from the nonstoichiometric tungstic acids (WO3&#183;H2O). These opto&#8208;critical phases enable a dynamic equilibrium shift in lattice defect stabilization, facilitating an unprecedented a whole solar wavelength response. This response manifests as photothermal, photo&#8208;assisted water evaporation, and photo&#8208;electrochemical characteristics. Harnessing all&#8208;solar energy, this one&#8208;pot SPsC strategy may steer the design and development of advanced oxide materials, enhancing functionality across diverse application domains.

         <title>Isomerized Green Solid Additive Engineering for Thermally&#8208;Stable and Eco&#8208;Friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 19% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, necessitating the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, we propose an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on a molecular level, we achieve a PCE of 18.72% for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancements.

         <title>Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible and Recoverable Carbon Nitrides Featuring CN4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon nitrides featuring 3D frameworks of CN4 tetrahedra were identified as one of the great aspirations of materials science, expected to have a hardness greater than or comparable to diamond. After more than three decades of efforts to synthesize them, no unambiguous evidence of their existence has been delivered. Here, we report the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis of three carbon&#8208;nitrogen compounds, tI14&#8208;C3N4, hP126&#8208;C3N4, and tI24&#8208;CN2, in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. Their structures were solved and refined using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Physical properties investigations showed that these strongly covalently bonded materials, ultra&#8208;incompressible and superhard, also possess high energy density, piezoelectric, and photoluminescence properties. The novel carbon nitrides are unique among high&#8208;pressure materials, as being produced above 100&#160;GPa they are recoverable in air at ambient conditions.

         <title>Ultrarapid&#8208;Acting Microneedles for Immediate Delivery of Biotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch to realize immediate delivery of biotherapeutics with negligible residuals in tissue is presented. In this design, accelerated drug release is achieved by incorporating effervescent agents into the needle tip. The rapid release, easy administration, and excellent biocompatibility of URA&#8208;MN are well demonstrated in three different mouse models.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) injection is a common administration route for rapid and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics. However, syringe&#8208;based injections usually require professional assistance and are associated with pain and potential risks of infections, thus leading to undesired patient compliance and poor life quality. Herein, this work presents an ultrarapid&#8208;acting microneedle (URA&#8208;MN) patch for immediate transdermal delivery of therapeutics in a minimally invasive manner. Effervescent agents are incorporated into the tip of URA&#8208;MN for rapid generation of CO2 bubbles upon insertion into the skin, immediately powering the biotherapeutics release within a few minutes. The release kinetics of diverse agents including liraglutide (LRT), insulin, and heparin from the URA&#8208;MN patches are evaluated in three different mouse models, and the rapid release of biotherapeutics and potent therapeutic effects are achieved with only 5 min administration. Noteworthily, attributed to the short application duration and negligible residuals of MN matrix remaining in the skin, the URA&#8208;MN patch shows desirable biocompatibility after six&#8208;week administration.

         <title>MDM2&#8208;Targeting Reassembly Peptide (TRAP) Nanoparticles for p53&#8208;Based Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATO@MtrapNP construction, followed by MDM2&#8208;trap construction and mutated p53 rescuer delivering for oncotherapy is described. This strategy allows for efficient delivery of p53 mutation rescuers and thus suppresses the associated side effects. At the same time, the MDM2 trap can be constructed to efficiently inhibit MDM2 function, thereby protecting p53 from MDM2 inhibition.








Abstract
Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53&#8208;mediated oncotherapy. For p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Therefore, ARF&#8208;mimetic MDM2&#8208;targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53&#8208;based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53&#8208;mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53&#8208;wild&#8208;type tumors. Thus, the MDM2&#8208;trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53&#8208;mutated tumors.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite via Green Solvent Assisted Perovskite Single Crystal Redissolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Perovskite single&#8208;crystal redissolution (PSCR) strategy is highly desired for efficient formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced phase purity, improved film quality, low trap&#8208;state density, and good stability. However, the phase transition and crystallization dynamics of FAPbI3 remain unclear in the PSCR process compared to the conventional fabrication from the mixing of precursor materials. In this work, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted (GSA) method is employed to synthesize centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals, which serve as the high&#8208;purity precursor to fabricate perovskite films. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCR strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation and inhibits the complex intermediate phases monitored by in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;phase stability is prolonged due to the relaxation of the residual lattice strain through the isotropic orientation phase growth. Consequently, the GSA&#8208;assisted PSCR strategy effectively promotes crystallization and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite solar cells, which boosts the device efficiency from 22.08% to 23.92% with significantly enhanced open circuit voltage. These findings provide deeper insight into the PSCR process in terms of its efficacy in phase formation and lattice strain release. The green low&#8208;cost solvent may also offer a new and ideal solvent candidate for large&#8208;scale production of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Pseudomorphic Synthesis of Monodisperse Afterglow Carbon Dot&#8208;doped SiO2 Microparticles for Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Synthesizing monodisperse afterglow microparticles (MPs) is crucial for creating photonic crystal (PC) platforms with multiple optical states for optoelectronics. However, achieving high uniformity in both size and morphology is challenging for inorganic afterglow MPs using conventional methods. In this contribution, we report on a novel approach for the synthesis of carbon dot (CD)&#8208;doped SiO2 MPs with tunable afterglow properties and size distributions. Our mechanism studies suggest that the pseudomorphic transformation of SiO2 MPs enables CD doping, providing a hydrogen bond&#8208;enriched environment for triplet state stabilization, which generates green afterglow while retaining the uniformity in size and morphology of the parent SiO2 MPs. Furthermore, we show the utility of CD&#8208;doped SiO2 MPs in the fabrication of rationally designed PC patterns using a combined consecutive dip&#8208;coating and laser&#8208;assisted etching strategy. The pattern displays multiple optical responses under different lighting conditions, including angle&#8208;dependent structural colors and blue luminescence under daylight and upon 365&#8208;nm irradiation, respectively, as well as time&#8208;dependent green afterglow after ceasing UV excitation. Our findings pave the way for further controlling the dynamics of spontaneous emissions by PCs to enable complicated optical states for advanced photonics.

         <title>The Secret of Nanoarrays Toward Efficient Electrochemical Water Splitting: A Vision of Self&#8208;dynamic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoarray electrocatalysts with unique advantage of facilitating gas bubble detachment have garnered significant interest in gas evolution reactions (GERs). Existing research has largely been based on a static hypothesis, assuming that buoyancy is the only driving force for the release of bubbles during GERs. However, this hypothesis overlooks the effect of the self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte flow, which is induced by the release of mature bubbles and helps destabilize and release the smaller, immature bubbles nearby. Herein, the enhancing effect of self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte flow on nanoarray structures is examined. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the flow field of electrode with arrayed surface focuses shear force directly onto the gas bubble for efficient detachment, due to the flow could pass through voids and channels to bypass the shielding effect. The flow field therefore has a more substantial impact on the arrayed surface than the nanoscale smooth surface in terms of reducing the critical bubble size. To validate this, superaerophobic ferrous&#8208;nickel sulfide nanoarrays were fabricated and employed for water splitting, which display improved efficiency for GERs. This study contributes to understanding the influence of self&#8208;dynamic electrolyte on GERs and emphasizes that it should be considered when designing and evaluating nanoarray electrocatalysts.

         <title>Axially Encoded Mechano&#8208;Metafiber Electronics by Local Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;material integration, such as soft elastic and stiff components, exhibits rich deformation and functional behaviors to meet complex needs. Integrating multi&#8208;materials in the level of individual fiber is poised to maximize the functional design capacity of smart wearable electronic textiles, but remains unfulfilled. Here, we continuously integrate stiff and soft elastic components into single fiber to fabricate encoded mechano&#8208;metafiber by programmable microfluidic sequence spinning. The sequences with programmable modulus feature the controllable localization of strain along metafiber length. The mechano&#8208;metafibers feature two essential nonlinear deformation modes, which are local strain amplification and retardation. We extend the sequence&#8208;encoded metafiber into fiber networks to exhibit greatly enhanced strain amplification and retardation capability in cascades. Local strain engineering enables the design of highly sensitive strain sensors, stretchable fiber devices to protect brittle components and the fabrication of high&#8208;voltage supercapacitors as well as axial electroluminescent arrays. Our approach allows the scalably design of multi&#8208;material metafibers with programmable localized mechanical properties for woven metamaterials, smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Healable Ionic Conductors with Extremely Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High Mechanical Strength Enabled by Hydrophobic Domain&#8208;Locked Reversible Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Extremely low hysteresis, high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and excellent healability are essential for stretchable ionic conductors to enhance their reliability and meet for cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the fabrication of stretchable ionic conductors with such mutually exclusive properties remains challenging. Herein, extremely low&#8208;hysteresis and healable ionic conductors with a tensile strength of &#8764;8.9&#160;MPa and toughness of &#8764;23.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 are fabricated through the complexation of 4&#8208;carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA)&#8208;grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (denoted as PVA&#8208;CBA) and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) followed by acidification and ion&#8208;loading steps. The acidification step generates the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors with in situ&#8208;formed dynamic hydrophobic domains that lock and stabilize non&#8208;covalent interactions. This significantly minimizes the energy dissipation of the ionic conductors during cyclic mechanical loading (&#8804; 200% strain), resulting in ionic conductors with extremely low hysteresis (&#8764;5%). The fractured ionic conductors can be healed at 60&#160;&#176;C to restore their original properties. Because of the extremely low hysteresis, the PVA&#8208;CBA/PAH ionic conductors show a highly stable and reproducible electrical response over 5 000 uninterrupted loading&#8208;unloading cycles at a strain of 200%. The ionic conductor&#8208;based sensors exhibit a high sensitivity to a wide range of strains (1&#8764;500%).

         <title>Rational Design of DNA Hydrogels Based on Molecular Dynamics of Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, DNA has emerged as a fascinating building material to engineer hydrogels due to its excellent programmability, which has gained considerable attention in biomedical applications. Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship and underlying molecular determinants of DNA hydrogel is essential to precisely tailor its macroscopic properties at molecular level. In this review, we highlight the rational design principles of DNA molecular networks based on molecular dynamics of polymers on the temporal scale, which can be engineered via the backbone rigidity and crosslinking kinetics. By elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms and theories, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how the tunable DNA backbone rigidity and the crosslinking kinetics lead to desirable macroscopic properties of DNA hydrogels, including mechanical properties, diffusive permeability, swelling behaviors, and dynamic features. Furthermore, we also discuss how the tunable macroscopic properties make DNA hydrogels promising candidates for biomedical applications, such as cell culture, tissue engineering, bio&#8208;sensing, and drug delivery.

         <title>Self&#8208;destructive Copper Carriers Induce Pyroptosis And Cuproptosis for Efficient Tumor Immunotherapy Against Dormant And Recurrent Tumors</title>

Abstract
Activating the strong immune system is a key initiative to counteract dormant tumors and prevent their recurrence. Herein, self&#8208;destructive and multi&#8208;enzymatically active copper&#8208;quinone&#8208;GOx nanoparticles (abbreviated as CQG NPs) have been designed to induce harmonious and balanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis using the &#8220;Tai Chi mindset&#8221; to awaken the immune response for suppressing dormant and recurrent tumors. One advantage of this cleverly designed material is that it can disrupt the specific antioxidant defense mechanism of tumor cells by inhibiting the nuclear factor&#8208;erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)&#8208;quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) signaling pathway. Furthermore, combined with its excellent multi&#8208;enzyme activity, it activates NOD&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Meanwhile, cuproptosis could be triggered by copper ions released from the self&#8208;destructive disintegration of CQG NPs and the sensitivity of cancer cells to cuproptosis was further enhanced through the depletion of endogenous copper chelators via the Michael addition reaction between glutathione (GSH) and quinone ligand, oxygen production from catalase&#8208;like reaction, and starvation&#8208;induced glucose deficiency. More importantly, CQG NPs&#8208;induced pyroptosis and cuproptosis can jointly promote immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, enhance the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor, and subsequently activate robust systemic immunity. Collectively, this study provides a new strategy to better resist tumor dormancy, prevent tumor recurrence, and improve the clinical prognosis of tumors.

         <title>Polymer Coating with Balanced Coordination Strength and Ion Conductivity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Decorating Zn anodes with functionalized polymers has been considered as an effective strategy to inhibit dendrite growth. However, this normally brings extra interfacial resistance rendering slow reaction kinetics of Zn2+. Herein, we report a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) coating with modulated coordination strength and ion conductivity for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The P2VP coating favors a high electrolyte wettability and rapid Zn2+ migration speed (Zn2+ transfer number, tZn2+ = 0.58). Electrostatic potential calculation shows that P2VP mildly coordinates with Zn2+ (adsorption energy = &#8208;0.94&#160;eV), which promotes a preferential deposition of Zn along the (002) crystal plane. Notably, the use of partially (26%) quaternized P2VP (q&#8208;P2VP), further reduces the interfacial resistance to 126 &#937;, leading to a high ion migration speed (tZn2+ = 0.78) and a considerably low nucleation overpotential (18&#160;mV). As a result of the synergistic effect of mild coordination and partial electrolysis, the overpotential of the q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;decorated Zn anode retains at a considerably low level (&#8764;46&#160;mV) over 1000&#160;h at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.5H2O || glass fiber || q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;Zn full cell reveals a lower average capacity decay rate of only 0.018% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Spinning a Liquid Wheel and Driving Surface Thermomagnetic Convection with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A typical Tesla thermomagnetic engine employs a solid magnetic wheel to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, while thermomagnetic convection in ferrofluid is still challenging to observe because it is a volume convection that occurs in an enclosed space. Using a water&#8208;based ferrofluid, we demonstrate a liquid Tesla thermomagnetic engine and report the observation of thermomagnetic convection on a free surface. Both types of fluid motions are driven by light and observed by simply placing ferrofluid on a cylindrical magnet. The surface thermomagnetic convection on the free surface is made possible by eliminating the Marangoni effect, while the spinning of the liquid wheel is achieved through the solid&#8208;like behavior of the ferrofluid under a strong magnetic field. Increasing the magnetic field reveals a transition from simple thermomagnetic convection to a combination of the central spin of the spiky wheel surrounded by thermomagnetic convection in the outer region of the ferrofluid. We further demonstrate the coupling between multiple ferrofluid wheels through a fluid bridge. These demonstrations not only unveil the unique properties of ferrofluid but also provide a new platform for studying complex fluid dynamics and thermomagnetic convection, opening up exciting opportunities for light&#8208;controlled fluid actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Two&#8208;Dimensional Sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. However, metal&#8208;free COFs for photocatalytic overall water splitting remain elusive, primarily due to challenges in simultaneously regulating their band structures and catalytic sites to enable concurrent half&#8208;reactions. Herein, two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs containing the same donor&#8208;acceptor structure are constructed via Knoevenagel condensation and Schiff base reaction to afford cyanovinylene&#8208; and imine&#8208;bridged COFs, respectively. The minute difference in the linkage leads to a remarkable difference in their photocatalytic activity toward water splitting. The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF exhibits notable activity for photocatalytic overall water splitting, which can reach an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.53% at 420&#160;nm. In contrast, the 2D imine&#8208;linked COF cannot catalyze the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the band structure and promoting charge separation in COFs, thereby enabling overall water splitting. Moreover, it is further shown that crystallinity substantially impacts the photocatalytic performance of COFs. This study represents the first successful example of developing metal&#8208;free COFs with high crystallinity for photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Catalyzing Artificial Photosynthesis with TiO2 Heterostructures and Hybrids &#8211; Emerging Trends in a Classical yet Contemporary Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) stands out as a versatile transition&#8208;metal oxide with applications ranging from energy conversion/storage and environmental remediation to sensors and optoelectronics. While extensively researched for these emerging applications, TiO2 has also achieved commercial success in various fields including paints, inks, pharmaceuticals, food additives, and advanced medicine. Thanks to the tunability of their structural, morphological, optical, and electronic characteristics, TiO2 nanomaterials are among the most researched engineering materials. Besides these inherent advantages, the low cost, low toxicity, and biocompatibility of TiO2 nanomaterials position them as a sustainable choice of functional materials for energy conversion. Although TiO2 is a classical photocatalyst well&#8208;known for its structural stability and high surface activity, TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysis is still an active area of research particularly in the context of catalyzing artificial photosynthesis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments and emerging trends in TiO2 heterostructures and hybrids for artificial photosynthesis. We begin by discussing the common synthesis methods for TiO2 nanomaterials, including hydrothermal synthesis and sol&#8208;gel synthesis. We then delve into TiO2 nanomaterials and their photocatalytic mechanisms, highlighting the key advancements that have been made in recent years. We discuss the strategies to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, including surface modification, doping modulation, heterojunction construction, and synergy of composite materials, with a specific emphasis on their applications in artificial photosynthesis. TiO2&#8208;based heterostructures and hybrids present exciting opportunities for catalyzing solar fuel production, organic degradation, and CO2 reduction via artificial photosynthesis. This review offers an overview of the latest trends and advancements, while also highlighting the ongoing challenges and prospects for future developments in this classical yet rapidly evolving field.

         <title>High&#8208;Toughness and High&#8208;Strength Solvent&#8208;Free Linear Poly(ionic liquid) Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free elastomers, unlike gels, do not suffer from solvent evaporation and leakage in practical applications. However, it is challenging to realize the preparation of high&#8208;toughness (with both high stress and strain) ionic elastomers. Herein, high&#8208;toughness linear poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) elastomers were constructed via supramolecular ionic networks formed by the polymerization of halometallate ionic liquid (IL) monomers, without any chemical crosslinking. The obtained linear PIL elastomers exhibited high strength (16.5 MPa), Young's modulus (157.49 MPa), toughness (130.31 MJ m&#8722;3), and high crack propagation insensitivity (fracture energy 243.37 kJ m&#8722;2), owing to the enhanced intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions of PIL chains. Furthermore, PIL elastomer&#8208;based strain, pressure, and touch sensors have shown high sensitivity. The linear non&#8208;covalent crosslinked network endows the PIL elastomers with self&#8208;healing and recyclable properties, and broad application prospects in the fields of flexible sensor devices, health monitoring, and human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor Refines Hierarchical Morphology in Ternary Polymer Solar Cells: Enhanced Stability and 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising for efficient solar energy conversion, but achieving high efficiency and device longevity within a bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) structure remains a challenge. Traditional small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in the BHJ blend show thermodynamic instability affecting the morphology. In contrast, tethered SMAs exhibit higher glass transition temperatures, mitigating these concerns. Yet, they might not integrate well with polymer donors, causing pronounced phase separation and over&#8208;purification of mixed domains. Herein, we introduce a novel ternary device that uses DY&#8208;P2EH, a tethered dimeric SMA with conjugated side&#8208;chains as host acceptor, and BTP&#8208;ec9, a monomeric SMA as secondary acceptor, which respectively possess hypo&#8208;miscibility and hyper&#8208;miscibility with the polymer donor PM6. This unique combination affords a parallel&#8208;connected ternary BHJ blend, leading to a hierarchical and stable morphology. Our ternary device achieves a remarkable fill factor of 80.61% and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.09%. Furthermore, the ternary device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 85% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1100 hours of thermal stress at 85&#176;C. These findings highlight the potential advantage of tethered SMAs in the design of ternary devices with a refined hierarchical structure to achieve higher photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs, paving the way for more efficient and durable solar energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Ultrahigh Capacity from Complexation&#8208;Enabled Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with C70 as the Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Restricted by the available energy storage modes, currently rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RABs) can only provide a very limited experimental capacity, regardless of the very high gravimetric capacity of Al (2980 mAh g&#8722;1). Here, we report a novel complexation mechanism for energy storage in RABs by utilizing zero&#8208;dimensional fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8764; 1.65 V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200 mA g&#8722;1) of RABs. By means of in&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that this elevated capacity is attributed to the direct complexation of one C70 molecule with 23.5 (super)halogen moieties (superhalogen AlCl4 and/or halogen Cl) in average, forming (super)halogenated C70&#183;[AlCl4]mCln&#8208;m complexes. Upon discharging, decomplexation of C70&#183;[AlCl4]mCln&#8208;m releases AlCl4&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ions while preserving the intact fullerene cage. Our work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior non&#8208;invasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE might, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8208;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Electrochemical Hydrogen Production via Hybrid Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As one of the most promising approaches to producing high purity hydrogen (H2), electrochemical water splitting powered by the renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power has attracted considerable interest over the past decade. However, the water electrolysis process is seriously hampered by the sluggish electrode reaction kinetics, especially the four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side, which induces a high reaction overpotential. At present, the emerging hybrid electrochemical water splitting strategy has been proposed by integrating thermodynamically favorable electro&#8208;oxidation reactions with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, providing a new opportunity for energy&#8208;efficient H2 production. To achieve highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective hybrid water splitting (HWS) towards large&#8208;scale practical H2 production, much work has been continuously done to exploit the alternative anodic oxidation reactions and cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalysts. This review will focus on recent developments on electrochemical H2 production coupled with alternative oxidation reactions, including the choice of anodic substrates, the investigation on electrocatalytic materials, and the deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Finally, some insights into the scientific challenges now standing in the way of future advancement of the hybrid water electrolysis technique are shared, in the hope of inspiring further innovative efforts in this rapidly growing field.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of Organic Electronic Materials Enabled by Hybrid Top&#8208;Down/Bottom&#8208;Up Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high&#8208;throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly of user&#8208;defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time&#8208;consuming approaches that require significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, we combine &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8216; with &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8216; through automatic assembly and statistical models and provide a platform for the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. We generate a top&#8208;down set of almost 117K synthesized molecules containing their structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and use them as a building block library for bottom&#8208;up fragment&#8208;based design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks based on their available C(sp2/sp)&#8208;H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two philosophies of dataset construction. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of the resulting hybrid top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up compounds, enabling on&#8208;the&#8208;fly prediction of ground and excited state properties (frontier molecular orbital gaps, excitation energies) with high accuracy across known p&#8208;block organic compound space. With access to ab initio&#8208;quality optical properties, it is possible to apply this bottom&#8208;up pipeline using existing compounds as building blocks to any materials design campaign. To illustrate this, we screen over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission, the leading candidates of which provide insight into the structural features promoting this multiexciton&#8208;generating&#160;process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top-down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; assembly of user-defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time-consuming approaches that require significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, we combine &#8216;top-down&#8216; with &#8216;bottom-up&#8216; through automatic assembly and statistical models and provide a platform for the fragment-based discovery of organic electronic materials. We generate a top-down set of almost 117K synthesized molecules containing their structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and use them as a building block library for bottom-up fragment-based design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks based on their available C(sp2/sp)-H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two philosophies of dataset construction. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of the resulting hybrid top-down/bottom-up compounds, enabling on-the-fly prediction of ground and excited state properties (frontier molecular orbital gaps, excitation energies) with high accuracy across known p-block organic compound space. With access to ab initio-quality optical properties, it is possible to apply this bottom-up pipeline using existing compounds as building blocks to any materials design campaign. To illustrate this, we screen over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission, the leading candidates of which provide insight into the structural features promoting this multiexciton-generating&#160;process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced resonance for facilitated modulation of large&#8208;area perovskite films with stable photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Upscaling efficient and stable perovskite films is a challenging task in the industrialization of perovskite solar cells partly due to the lack of high&#8208;performance hole transport materials (HTMs), which can simultaneously promote hole transport and regulate the quality of perovskite films especially in inverted solar cells. Here, we design a novel HTM based on N&#8211;C = O resonance structure for facilitating the modulation of the crystallization and bottom&#8208;surface defects of perovskite films. Benefiting from the resonance interconversion (N&#8211;C = O and N+ = C&#8211;O&#8722;) in donor&#8208;resonance&#8208;donor (D&#8208;r&#8208;D) architecture and interactions with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, the resulting D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM with two donor units exhibits not only excellent hole extraction and transport capacities but also efficient crystallization modulation of perovskite for high&#8208;quality photovoltaic films in large area. The D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM&#8208;based large&#8208;area (1.02 cm2) devices exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 21.0%. Moreover, the large&#8208;area devices have excellent photo&#8208;thermal stability, showing only a 2.6% reduction in PCE under continuous AM 1.5G light illumination at elevated temperature (&#8764;65&#176;C) for over 1320&#160;h without encapsulation.

Abstract
The Q&#8208;switched material and device have attracted extensive attention due to their irreplaceable role in pulsed lasers. In this paper, BaO&#8208;TeO2&#8208;WO3 glass (BTW glass) with sound velocity and sound attenuation coefficient of 3422 m&#160;&#8722;1s and 0.653&#160;dB/cm is successfully selected and fabricated as acousto&#8208;optic material. Both free&#8208;spaced and fiber&#8208;coupled acousto&#8208;optic modulation devices based on BTW glass are designed and fabricated. The primary parameters such as diffraction efficiency, polarization extinction ratio, and insertion loss are comparable to or even surpassed that of commercial devices. A 1064&#160;nm pulsed laser is successfully realized with a BTW glass free&#8208;spaced acousto&#8208;optic modulator. The maximum optical conversion efficiency, the narrowest pulse width, and the maximum single pulse energy of the 1064&#160;nm pulsed laser are 32%, 54&#160;ns, and 242.6 &#956;J, respectively. Both the device and laser performance indicate that the BTW glass is a remarkable acousto&#8208;optic material.

         <title>Robust Molecular Anodes for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Based on Electropolymerized Molecular Cu Complexes</title>

Abstract
A multistep synthesis of a new tetra&#8208;amidate macrocyclic ligand functionalized with alkyl&#8208;thiophene moieties, 15,15&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)hexyl)&#8208;8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;dibenzo[b,h][1,4,7,10]tetraazacyclotridecine&#8208;6,7,14,16(15H,17H)&#8208;tetraone, H4L, is reported. The reaction of the deprotonated ligand, L4&#8722;, and Cu(II) generates the complex [LCu]2&#8722;, that can be further oxidized to Cu(III) with iodine to generate [LCu]&#8722;. The H4L ligand and their Cu complexes have been thoroughly characterized by analytic and spectroscopic techniques (including X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy, XAS). Under oxidative conditions, the thiophene group of [LCu]2&#8208; complex polymerizes on the surface of graphitic electrodes (glassy carbon disks (GC), glassy carbon plates (GCp), carbon nanotubes (CNT) or graphite felts (GF)) generating highly stable thin films. With CNTs deposited on a GC by drop casting, we obtain hybrid molecular materials labeled as GC/CNT@p&#8208;[LCu]2&#8722;. The latter are characterized by electrochemical techniques that show their capacity to electrocatalytically oxidize water to dioxygen at neutral pH. These new molecular anodes achieve current densities in the range of 0.4&#160;mA/cm2 at 1.30&#160;V versus NHE with an onset overpotential at approx. 250&#160;mV. Bulk electrolysis experiments show an excellent stability achieving TONs in the range of 7600 during 24&#160;h with no apparent loss of catalytic activity and maintaining the molecular catalyst integrity, as evidenced by electrochemical techniques and XAS spectroscopy. Further with highly porous graphitic materials such as GF, we obtain TONs in the range of 11,000.

         <title>Accelerating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Electronic Modulation and Drifting Effects of Pre&#8208;Lithiation Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient catalyst design is crucial for addressing the sluggish multi&#8208;step sulfur redox reaction (SRR) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs), which are among the promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, the limited understanding of the underlying catalytic kinetic mechanisms and the lack of precise control over catalyst structures pose challenges in designing highly efficient catalysts, which hinder the LiSBs&#8217; practical application. Here, drawing inspiration from our theoretical calculations, we propose the concept of precisely controlled pre&#8208;lithiation SRR electrocatalysts. The dual roles of channel and surface lithium in pre&#8208;lithiated 1T&#8217;&#8208;MoS2 are revealed, referred to as the &#8220;electronic modulation effect&#8221; and &#8220;drifting effect&#8221;, respectively, both of which contribute to accelerating the SRR kinetics. As a result, the thus&#8208;designed 1T&#8217;&#8208;LixMoS2/CS cathode obtained by epitaxial growth of pre&#8208;lithiated 1T&#8217;&#8208;MoS2 on cubic Co9S8 exhibits impressive performance with a high initial specific capacity of 1049.8 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate&#8208;capability, and remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability with a decay rate of only 0.019% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 3 C. This work highlights the importance of precise control in pre&#8208;lithiation parameters and the synergistic effects of channel and surface lithium, providing new valuable insights into the design and optimization of SRR electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance LiSBs.

Abstract
Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of &#8220;GPT AI&#8221; shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with &#8220;data&#8221; as the basic factor and &#8220;algorithm + computing power&#8221; as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of &#8220;GPT AI&#8221; shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with &#8220;data&#8221; as the basic factor and &#8220;algorithm + computing power&#8221; as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system. This leads us to think more about materials informatics, both in terms of opportunities and challenges. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion of AI models, materials infrastructures, and review the current advances in the discovery and design of new materials. With the rise of new research paradigms triggered by &#8220;AI for Science&#8221;, we propose the vane of materials informatics: &#8220;MatGPT&#8221;, and carry out the technical path planning from the aspects of data, descriptors, generative models, pre-training models, directed design models, collaborative training, experimental robots, as well as the efforts and preparations needed to develop a new generation of materials informatics. Finally, we discuss the challenges and constraints faced by materials informatics, in order to achieve a more digital, intelligent and automated construction of materials informatics with the joint efforts of more interdisciplinary scientists.

         <title>Dual&#8208;mode Conversion of Photodetector And Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on A Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For optoelectronic devices that convert optical signal to electrical signal, they can have a fast photoresponse speed to function as a photodetector, or possess the ability to perceive, memorize and process images to act as a neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS). However, the simultaneous implementation of photodetector and NVS on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the contradiction of photoresponse speed. In this work, to simultaneous achieve this complex function in a single device, trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as a NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both the recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device, but also provide the opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Modulation of Phase Transition in Cobalt Selenide with Simultaneous Construction of Heterojunctions for Highly&#8208;efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Phase&#8208;transformation of cobalt selenide (CoSe2) can effectively modulate its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. However, enhancing electroconductivity and catalytic activity/stability of CoSe2 still remains challenging.&#160;Heterostructure engineering may be feasible to optimize interfacial property to promote the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis on CoSe2&#8208;based catalyst. Herein, a heterostructure consisting of CoSe2 and cobalt nitride (CoN) embedded in a hollow carbon&#8208;cage is designed via a simultaneous phase/interface engineering strategy. Notably, phase transition of orthorhombic&#8208;CoSe2 to cubic&#8208;CoSe2 accompanied by in&#8208;situ CoN formation is realized to build the c&#8208;CoSe2/CoN heterointerface, which exhibits excellent/highly&#8208;stable activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Notably, heterostructure can modulate local coordination environment and increase Co&#8208;Se/N bond lengths. Theoretical calculations show that Co&#8208;site (c&#8208;CoSe2) with electronic state near Fermi energy level is main active sites for ORR/OER. Energetical tailoring of d&#8208;orbital electronic structure of Co atom of c&#8208;CoSe2 in heterostructure by in&#8208;situ CoN incorporation lowers thermodynamic barriers for ORR/OER. Bader charge analyses reveal that the internal electron transfer from c&#8208;CoSe2 to CoN affords high ORR/OER activities. Attractively, a zinc&#8208;air battery with c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;CoN cathode displays excellent cycling stability (250&#160;h) and charge/discharge voltage loss (0.953/0.96&#160;V). It highlights that heterointerface engineering provides an option for modulating bifunctional activity of metal selenides with controlled phase&#8208;transformation.

         <title>Magnetic Particle Imaging: From Tracer Design to Biomedical Applications in Vasculature Abnormality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging non&#8208;invasive tomographic technique based on the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to oscillating drive fields at the center of a static magnetic gradient. In contrast with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is driven by uniform magnetic fields and projects the anatomic information of the subjects, MPI directly tracks and quantifies MNPs in vivo without background signals. Moreover, it does not require radioactive tracers and has no limitations on imaging depth. This review first introduces the basic principles of MPI and important features of MNPs for advanced imaging sensitivity, spatial resolution, and targeted biodistribution. The latest research on optimized MPI tracers is reviewed based on their material composition, physical properties, and surface modifications. Since all the imaging benefits have led to a series of promising biomedical applications, we also discuss recent relational practices of MPI in vascular abnormalities, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, and cancers. Finally, some considerations of obstructions and recent progress closely related to the clinical translation of MPI are summarized to provide possible direction for future research and development.

         <title>Nir Plasmonic Nanozymes: Synergistic Enhancement Mechanism and Multi&#8208;modal Anti&#8208;infection Applications of MXene/MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozymes is considered as the promising antimicrobial agents due to the enzyme&#8208;like activity for chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT). However, it remains a challenge to develop novel nanozyme systems for achieving stimuli&#8208;responsive, and efficient nanozyme catalysis with multimodal synergistic enhancement. In this work, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and photothermal performance for effective antimicrobial applications. A Ti3C2 MXene/Fe&#8208;MOFs composite (MXM) with NIR plasmonic&#8208;enhanced CDT combined with PTT properties was successfully developed by loading metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanozymes onto Ti3C2 MXene. The mechanism of NIR induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)&#8208;enhanced CDT and PTT was well explained through activation energy (Ea), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescence analysis experiments, and finite element simulation. It reveals that MXene nanosheets exhibit NIR plasmon exciters and generate hot electrons that can transfer to the surface of Fe&#8208;MOFs, promoting the Fenton reaction and enhances CDT. While the photothermal heating of MXene produced by LSPR can also boost the CDT of Fe&#8208;MOFs under NIR irradiation. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results demonstrated that LSPR&#8208;induced MXM system had outstanding antimicrobial properties, could promote angiogenesis and collagen deposition, leading to the accelerated wound healing. Therefore, MXM hybrids present an alternative and effective antimicrobial platform with high biocompatibility and a LSPR involved synergistic enhanced CDT/PTT for the treatment of multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections and wound healing promotion.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost Kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly&#8208;distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). In this work we show that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an enhanced endogenous regeneration strategy to direct stem cell differentiation via mechanotransduction. Microfluidic hydrogel microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus and ECM ligand density are fabricated and demonstrated to recruit intervertebral disc progenitor/stem cells and train them to differentiate into nucleus pulposus&#8208;like cells for repairing intervertebral disc degeneration.








Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) is loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotargeted Delivery of Immune Therapeutics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted delivery platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment using high endothelial venule (HEV)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles is developed. The HEV&#8208;targeting nanoplatform delivers anti&#8208;CD3 antibodies simultaneously to pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreata, thereby suppressing effector T cells and prolonging the reversal of T1D in a nonobese diabetic mouse model.








Abstract
Immune therapeutics holds great promise in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Nonetheless, their progress is hampered by limited efficacy, equipoise, or issues of safety. To address this, a novel and specific nanodelivery platform for T1D that targets high endothelial venules (HEVs) presented in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreas is developed. Data indicate that the pancreata of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with T1D are unique in their expression of newly formed HEVs. Anti&#8208;CD3 mAb is encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs), the surfaces of which are conjugated with MECA79 mAb that recognizes HEVs. Targeted delivery of these NPs improves accumulation of anti&#8208;CD3 mAb in both the PLNs and pancreata of NOD mice. Treatment of hyperglycemic NOD mice with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs results in significant reversal of T1D compared to those that are untreated, treated with empty NPs, or provided free anti&#8208;CD3. This effect is associated with a significant reduction of T effector cell populations in the PLNs and a decreased production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine in the mice treated with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs. In summary, HEV&#8208;targeted therapeutics may be used as a means by which immune therapeutics can be delivered to PLNs and pancreata to suppress autoimmune diabetes effectively.

         <title>Erasable, Rewritable, and Reprogrammable Dual Information Encryption Based on Photoluminescent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Hydrogel Shape Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating the fluorescence of a well&#8208;designed self&#8208;inclusion supramolecular fluorescent ink immobilized in a polymer brush on a hydrogel surface through host&#8211;guest recognition. This supramolecular recognition is combined with the shape&#8208;memory effect of responsive hydrogel to achieve dual&#8208;encryption.








Abstract
Information encryption technologies are very important for security, health, commodity, and communications, etc. Novel information encryption mechanisms and materials are desired to achieve multimode and reprogrammable encryption. Here, a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating fluorescence. A butyl&#8208;naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (N&#8208;CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &#946;&#8208;CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &#946;&#8208;CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re&#8208;writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual&#8208;encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Nanodisc&#8208;Paved Biobridge Facilitates Stem Cell Membrane Fusogenicity for Intracerebral Shuttling and Bystander Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane fusogenicity technology using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides is designed to functionalize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a lipid raft&#8208;mediated membrane fusion pathway. For Alzheimer's disease therapy, 4F&#8211;VBP (HDL) is assembled for MSC4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) fabrication. After systemic infusion, MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) recognize pathological vascular clues for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing, achieving bystander effects on neurons and microglia.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies experience steadfast clinical advances but are still hindered by inefficient site&#8208;specific migration. An adaptable MSC membrane fusogenicity technology is conceptualized for lipid raft&#8208;mediated targeting ligand embedding by using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides. According to the pathological clues of brain diseases, the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 specialized VBP peptide is fused with 4F to assemble 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL), which acts as a biobridge and transfers VBP onto the living cell membrane via lipid rafts for surface engineering of MSCs in suspension. When compared with the membrane&#8208;modifying strategies of PEGylated phospholipids, 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL) provides a 3.86 higher linkage efficiency to obtain MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL), which can recognize and adhere to the inflammatory endothelium for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing and brain accumulation. In APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the transcriptomic analysis reveals that systemic administration of MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) can activate pathways associated with neuronal activity and diminish neuroinflammation for rewiring AD brains. This customizable HDL&#8208;mediated membrane fusogenicity platform primes MSC inflammatory brain delivery, which can be expanded to other disease treatments by simply fusing 4F with relevant ligands for living cell engineering.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free 0D Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new 0D lead&#8208;free metal halide upconversion smart material is developed and applied as a moisture sensor. It exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Additionally, this upconversion smart material is applied to cipher text information encryption via a laser&#8208;based optical lighting method.








Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright 0D Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals. Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, PCs co&#8208;doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ exhibit hydrochromic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through the sensitive detection of water in tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave the way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#176;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent&#8208;infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent&#8208;immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered Salmonella&#8208;responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands&#8208;free detection of 103 colony forming units (CFU) g&#8722;1 target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real&#8208;world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well&#8208;known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high&#8208;performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high&#8208;performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract
Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step&#8208;assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)+&#8208;terminated LaAlO3 (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in&#8208;plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step&#8208;edge atoms; the step&#8208;edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step&#8208;edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane electric fields.

     alt="Direct Observation of Atomic Step-Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ atomic-scale electron microscopy combined with first-principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic-scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step-assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-terminated LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in-plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step-edge atoms; the step-edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step-edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first-principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

     alt="Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG-N materials developed in this work achieve record-fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated carbon (CF&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CF&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG-N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG-N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG-N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG-N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation and Activating a Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;Induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;Free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of solvent&#8208;free direct ink writing (DIW) of carbon dots is demonstrated via liquid crystallization, giving rise to highly luminescent fluorescent patterns in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, respectively, due to the significantly limited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect, and promising technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low&#8208;temperature (&lt;50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that DIW with the LC inks dramatically outperforms DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of the LC processing. The approach reported herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Oxides Enabling Anomalously Stable Charge Transport across the Li/Electrolyte Interface in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li&#8208;ion correlation. High Li&#8208;ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa2PO8 without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.








Abstract
The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS4 tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is discovered in LiTa2PO8 and its derivatives, wherein Li&#8208;ion migration channels are connected by four&#8208; or five&#8208;fold oxygen&#8208;coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li&#8208;ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid&#8208;like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for Li/LiTa2PO8/Li cells without interfacial modifications. These findings provide principles for the future discovery and design of improved solid electrolytes that do not require modifications to the Li/solid electrolyte interface to achieve stable ionic transport.

Natural light enabling spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40 alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully. It can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the spin wave is modulated stably, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior








Abstract
Spin waves are considered to be an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enablings spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40&#8208;alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) by sunlight can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <dc:description>
A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

Because the single-crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer-embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built-in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow-band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;Compliant Bioelectronic Interfaces through Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Conducting Polymer Hydrogel Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tough hydrovoltaic coating with a strong structural binding effect is developed for the simultaneous achievement of good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage &#8776;3.18 V) and highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing ability. Based on skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures, wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat is demonstrated.








Abstract
The lack of a strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of the evaporation&#8208;driven hydrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It is a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hydrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, a flexible tough polyacrylonitrile/alumina (PAN/Al2O3) hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage, Voc&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V&#160;M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;m) capabilities is developed. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 strong water&#8208;flow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures are proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of the evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

         <title>Integrating Enrichment, Reduction, and Oxidation Sites in One System for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Regulating the Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment through Designing a COF with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Synergistic effects of Co&#9472;N coordination and a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior.








Abstract
The detrimental growth of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) is explored as an artificial SEI on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to the&#160;COF. The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li&#8208;nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

Following oral administration in mice, &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticles (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) target and transpass intestinal M cells, overcome the epithelial barrier, and undergo phagocytosis by macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; pass through the lymphatic system, enter systemic circulation, and then spontaneously target a primary tumor and metastatic lesions, functioning like &#8220;precision&#8208;guided stealth missiles&#8221;, improving the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhikes&#160;&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs&#160;is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control LUMO Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rolling transfer of Langmuir layers of amphiphilic C60 derivatives is shown to enable the production of films with highly defined morphology. The resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies enable the establishment of a practical model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor. This allows prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.








Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the optoelectronic properties in organic films, which are crucial for their application, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here,&#160;an automated method is presented for fabricating thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extension of domain edges, both of which are used to control nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during the deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that the rtLL method advances the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with defined morphology. The variation in nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions is thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square&#8208;wave voltammetry) enable the establishment of a model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for the prediction of the range of accessible LUMO energies.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Restraining Interfacial Cu2+ by using Amorphous SnO2 as Sacrificial Protection Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy is proposed to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to formate. The high active interface can significantly lower the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) of the carbon dioxide reduction and enhance its selectivity and activity for formate. 








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate is of great interest in the field of electrochemical energy. Cu&#8208;based material is an appealing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. However, retaining Cu2+ under the high cathodic potential of CO2RR remains a great challenge, leading to low electrocatalytic selectivity, activity, and stability. Herein, inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 (c&#8208;CuO/a&#8208;SnO2) is reported, which greatly boosts the electrocatalytic sensitivity, activity, and stability for CO2RR to formate. The as&#8208;made hybrid catalyst can achieve superior high selectivity for CO2RR to formate with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.7%, and a superhigh current density of over 1 A cm&#8722;2 that far outperforms industrial benchmarks (FE &gt; 90%, current density &gt; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s&#8208;orbital in interfacial a&#8208;SnO2 offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu2+, which can effectively retain nearby Cu2+, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO2RR to formate.

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;stranded DNA is cooperatively compacted into designed shapes by triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides, which bridge multiple normal or reverse Hoogsteen recognition domains. Hoogsteen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is highly programmable, methodologically straightforward, and yields large uniquely addressable nanostructures at low&#8208;cost. Moreover, the presented &#8220;triplex origami&#8221; method enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates not achievable by other artificial methodologies.








Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Conversion of Dielectric Surface Effect into Volume Effect for High Output Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of the dielectric surface effect into a volume effect is proposed for a high output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, the physics mechanism of thick dielectric films used in TENGs is identified and a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs is provided.








Abstract
Improving the output energy and durability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains a considerable challenge for their practical applications. Owing to the interface effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, thinner films with higher dielectric constants yield a higher output; however, they are not durable for practical applications. Herein, the dielectric surface effect is changed into a volume effect by adopting a millimeter&#8208;thick dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges can hop in the surface state of the network. Charge migration inside the dielectric film is the key factor affecting the output of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#160;with a thick film, based on which each working stage follows the energy&#8208;maximization principle in the voltage&#8211;charge plot. The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;Hz&#8722;1, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary&#8208;mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.

         <title>Porous, Ultrathin PtAgBiTe Nanosheets for Direct Hydrazine Hydrate Fuel Cell Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, ultrathin PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets with widths beyond 700 nm are synthesized via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route, and are employed as anode electrocatalysts for hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction and actual direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets in actual hydrazine&#8211;O2/air fuel cell devices are 532.9/315.9 mW cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D&#160;nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) are obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs are assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endow the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrates that the modified Pt activates the N&#8211;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitates dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices are boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C are 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>

An implantable, biodegradable, and wireless triboelectric device is developed for cancer therapy. The significantly enhanced tumor therapeutic effects against a broad&#8208;spectrum of tumors through cell and animal experiments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, an improved and alternative method is proposed for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable, and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) for ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. The in&#8208;layer channels provide additional NH4+ storage sites and rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. The E&#8208;VOPO shows exceptional NH4+ storage performance with increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. The resulting full cell operates stably for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, an electrochemical phase transformation approach is proposed for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on the (001) layers. The findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

DNA Nanotechnology
DNA nanotechnology, so far, has almost exclusively relied on Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. In article number 2302497, Minke A. D. Nijenhuis, Kurt V. Gothelf, and co&#8208;workers introduce a triplex origami methodology. They demonstrate that triplex DNA, formed by Hoogsteen interactions, also possesses remarkable potential for nanoscale engineering. Triplex origami enables unprecedented large&#8208;scale architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA templates, folding and compacting them into sheets, bundles, and even custom potted flower shapes.

Tissue Regeneration
In article number 2300180, Hao Chen, Wenguo Cui, Yuhui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers propose a hydrogel&#8208;microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with cell recruiting and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction. The microsphere niche guides the fate of endogenous stem cells in the aberrant mechanical microenvironment, offering an effective strategy for enhancing the endogenous regeneration of degenerated tissues.

Polar Oxide Surfaces
In article number 2303051, Jaekwang Lee, Sang Ho Oh, and co&#8208;workers discover a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces using in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with atomic simulation. The dynamic motion of atomic steps, activated at a high temperature, converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via a step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

Superconducting Diode Effect
Magnetization control of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. In article number 2304083, Hideki Narita, Teruo Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>

The review outlines catalyst advancements for high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
cells operating at elevated temperatures (160&#8208;180 &#176;C). These cells utilize reformate/air gasses and employ phosphoric acid within the polybenzimidazole polymer matrix as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. Catalysts employed are platinum or platinum&#8208;alloyed nanoparticles immobilized on a carbon support.








Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standard is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high&#8208;temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.
