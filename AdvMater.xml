         <title>Recent Advances of Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Exotic Quantum Materials: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief review of bulk photovoltaic effect that induces static electric current under a uniform light illumination in single phase materials has been conducted. We summary the key factors, including theoretical and experimental evidences and basic symmetry arguments. Three main types of quantum material families, including electric polar, magnetic, and topological materials, have been discussed along with their potential applications.








ABSTRACT
Bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect is a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical process that converts a light field into direct electric current and has attracted tremendous interest for efficient power conversion applications. The conventional photocurrent generations based on a single p&#8208;n junctions are generally governed by the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit and require well&#8208;controlled atomic structure and band alignment. The BPV effect could occur in a single material without complicated heterojunction fabrication. The generated open&#8208;circuit electric voltage can be even higher than the bandgap of the hosting material, and the energy conversion efficiency could overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. Here, we review BPV generation mechanisms, including the intrinsic shift current and extrinsic ballistic current, and their coupling with various (electric, magnetic, and topological) order parameters. As for the material platforms, we review recent experimental and theoretical advances on BPV generation in quantum materials, including ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials, magnetic materials, and band topological materials. Then, we summarize how BPV magnitude can be enhanced by reducing the bandgap of semiconductors and introducing band inversion or crossing between valence and conduction band edges in topological systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges for further theoretical and experimental understanding and their practical applications.

         <title>De Novo Construction of Glutathione Activatable Photosensitizers Boosts Sequential Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Imaging and Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficacy&#8208;toxicity optimization is the current research focus of activatable photodynamic therapy. Herein, we de novo construct traditional 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate group to obtain PcGx including high quenching efficiency and precise activation. PcGx could precisely distinguish the cancer cells from normal cells based on GSH concentration. Subsequently, the PcGx@HP achieves sequential photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging, and precisely inhibits tumor growth.








ABSTRACT
Activatable photosensitizers (aPSs) have been found to ameliorate controllability of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) chemistry, led by 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate group, realizes the switching of aPSs from off to on through the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) effect. However, the ultra&#8208;sensitive reactivity to glutathione (GSH) greatly reduces the precision of diagnosis and PDT. Herein, we focused on the quenching efficiency and precise activation through structure&#8208;activity relationships to optimize the phthalocyanine&#8208;based aPSs (PcGx). The improved PcGx could distinguish GSH levels from cancer cells to normal cells. Moreover, cancer cell membrane targeting hyaluronic acid carrier is introduced to construct J aggregation&#8208;driven nanoplatform (PcGx@HP). This nanoplatform could not only stabilize and enhance the J aggregation, but also obtain the sequential photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in vivo. Subsequent studies verifies that PcGx@HP could inhibit tumor growth without off&#8208;target toxicity in breast cancer xenograft model. This study provides a reliable method for the de novo construction and development of precise aPSs for sequential imaging and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Intelligent Tactile Perception Revolution: Innovations in Flexible FET&#8208;Based Tactile Sensors for Next&#8208;Gen Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically explores flexible FET&#8208;based tactile sensors, dissecting their four fundamental sensing mechanisms and performance optimization strategies for enhanced sensitivity and stability. Through material&#8211;structure co&#8208;design, stretchability engineering, and high&#8208;resolution fabrication, these FET&#8208;based sensors enable breakthroughs in electronic skin, biomimetic perception, and interactive displays, paving the way for revolutionary intelligent human&#8211;machine interfaces and brain&#8211;machine integration.









ABSTRACT
Field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with controllable field&#8208;dependent carrier transport characteristics and unique signal amplification have provided an excellent platform for developing high&#8208;performance artificial sensors and intelligent&#8208;sensing interaction technologies. As the critical component of humanoid robotics, FET&#8208;based tactile sensors with diverse working mechanisms have been studied intensively and have demonstrated remarkable potential in intelligent human&#8211;machine interactions. Given that effective carrier&#8208;modulation capabilities of FETs significantly determine critical metrics of tactile sensing systems, this review systematically explores how diverse device, material, and processing innovations create different sensing characteristics, including tactile sensitivity, stretchability, and resolution, that thus underlie diverse strategies to engineer sensing behaviors toward specific applications of FET tactile sensors. We also examine the various strategies, including material&#8211;structure co&#8208;design, stretchability engineering, and high&#8208;resolution fabrication technologies, to engineer sensing behaviors in FET tactile sensors toward specific applications spanning wearable electronic skins, tactile&#8208;perceptive neuromorphic systems, and intelligent displays. Finally, we discuss the challenges regarding signal stability under dynamic deformation, response linearity, and saturation in high&#8208;pressure regimes, and scalable high&#8208;resolution integration, and outline promising solutions through the co&#8208;optimization of intrinsically stretchable materials, innovative device architectures, and advanced multi&#8208;scale fabrication processes.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;Amplified Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Time&#8208;Locked Imaging Epilepsy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a cascade&#8208;amplified ratiometric imaging strategy, we developed a highly sensitive ratiometric polymeric fluorescent probe that enables real&#8208;time and time&#8208;locked delineation of the epileptogenic network by integrating two key pathological features: seizure&#8208;induced acidosis fluctuations and sustained neuroinflammation within the neurovascular unit. This biocompatible probe is specifically engineered to expand surgical eligibility and improve prognostic outcomes in patients with drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy.








ABSTRACT
Accurate localization of the epileptogenic network (EN) is essential for surgical intervention in drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy, which affects over 15 million people globally. However, current approaches are limited by their low specificity, insufficient sensitivity, and challenges in capturing transient epileptiform discharges, which results in surgical success rates ranging from 30% to 70%. Here, we present a cascade&#8208;amplified ratiometric imaging strategy employing an engineered fluorescent polymeric probe (CAR&#8208;FM) that tandemly targets two temporally distinct pathological features within the epileptogenic network: transient acidosis fluctuations triggered by discharges and sustained neuroinflammation. This dual&#8208;cascade amplification enables CAR&#8208;FM to achieve more than a &gt;150&#8208;fold enhancement in fluorescence ratio with markedly improved specificity and sensitivity. In addition, CAR&#8208;FM demonstrates robust applicability across four epilepsy models, which enables time&#8208;locked EN delineation for up to 100&#160;h. In epileptic mouse models, CAR&#8208;FM&#8208;guided resection yields a 67% greater reduction in seizure burden compared to that of conventional electrocorticography. Given its ultrahigh imaging sensitivity and biocompatibility, CAR&#8208;FM offers a clinically translatable strategy for intraoperatively refining EN visualization, which potentially expands the population eligible for epilepsy surgery.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Glass Nano&#8208;Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys Achieve Ultrahigh Strength and Large Homogeneous Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent development of the crystal&#8208;glass nano&#8208;dual&#8208;phase alloys, dramatically enhancing the strength and plasticity simultaneously. It highlights innovative design strategies, fabrication methods, and deformation mechanisms, while discussing promising applications such as service performance improvements in electrolytic catalysis, wear&#8208;resistant coatings. Additionally, key challenges and new perspectives are proposed.








Abstract
Higher strength and larger ductility are always the pursuit of goal in the research of structural materials. Grain refinement and amorphization can enhance the strength of alloys, yet have their own limitations. The ductility of nanocrystalline alloys is usually low (&lt;5%), due to mechanical instability of the nanograin boundary. Shear band (SB) forms after yielding, inducing almost zero plasticity of metallic glasses (MGs). In this article, the recent development of the crystal&#8208;glass nano&#8208;dual&#8208;phase (CG&#8208;NDP) alloys, dramatically enhancing the strength and plasticity is reviewed. The grain boundary (GB) is replaced by a nanoscale amorphous phase. This structure configuration substantially increases the stress barrier against dislocation motion, enhancing the yield strength up to a near&#8208;theoretical value. Furthermore, global plastic flow behavior of the nano&#8208;sized amorphous phase can be activated, promoting emission of dislocations at the crystal&#8208;glass interface. Some of these dislocations pass through the crystalline phase and are absorbed by the amorphous phase on the opposite interface, depicting a continuous emission&#8208;motion&#8208;annihilation process. These deformation mechanisms promote the large homogeneous plastic deformation under both compression and tension.

     alt="Crystal-Glass Nano-Dual-Phase Alloys Achieve Ultrahigh Strength and Large Homogeneous Plastic Deformation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the recent development of the crystal-glass nano-dual-phase alloys, dramatically enhancing the strength and plasticity simultaneously. It highlights innovative design strategies, fabrication methods, and deformation mechanisms, while discussing promising applications such as service performance improvements in electrolytic catalysis, wear-resistant coatings. Additionally, key challenges and new perspectives are proposed.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher strength and larger ductility are always the pursuit of goal in the research of structural materials. Grain refinement and amorphization can enhance the strength of alloys, yet have their own limitations. The ductility of nanocrystalline alloys is usually low (&amp;lt;5%), due to mechanical instability of the nanograin boundary. Shear band (SB) forms after yielding, inducing almost zero plasticity of metallic glasses (MGs). In this article, the recent development of the crystal-glass nano-dual-phase (CG-NDP) alloys, dramatically enhancing the strength and plasticity is reviewed. The grain boundary (GB) is replaced by a nanoscale amorphous phase. This structure configuration substantially increases the stress barrier against dislocation motion, enhancing the yield strength up to a near-theoretical value. Furthermore, global plastic flow behavior of the nano-sized amorphous phase can be activated, promoting emission of dislocations at the crystal-glass interface. Some of these dislocations pass through the crystalline phase and are absorbed by the amorphous phase on the opposite interface, depicting a continuous emission-motion-annihilation process. These deformation mechanisms promote the large homogeneous plastic deformation under both compression and tension. A new mechanism of crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation is further reviewed. Finally, their functional applications as electrolytic catalysis and wear-resistant coatings is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Refractory Neuron Based on Cs2AgBiBr6 Nanoionic Memristor for Efficient Motion Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a bio&#8208;inspired artificial neuron based on a Cs2AgBiBr6 nanoionic memristor for emulating neuronal firing and refractory behaviors. This device exhibits threshold conductance switching with a built&#8208;in electric potential, enabling the emulation of neuronal motion information encoding for accurate classification and trajectory prediction. This work provides new insights for bionic machine vision applications.








ABSTRACT
Biological neurons are highly efficient in encoding motion information, and their physical realization can inspire the development of emerging bionic machine vision technologies for autonomous driving and video monitoring applications. However, due to the difficulty in emulating the complex ion movement dynamics within neurons, the use of hardware to comprehensively emulate neuronal firing dynamics for encoding function replication remains challenging. Herein, we report a bio&#8208;inspired artificial neuron based on a Cs2AgBiBr6 memristor, which can replicate both neuronal firing and refractory period behaviors for motion information processing. We demonstrate that the bidirectional migration of Ag+ and Br&#8722; ions within Cs2AgBiBr6 can induce threshold conductance switching along with a strong built&#8208;in internal electric potential, mimicking neuronal excitation&#8211;resting responses to voltage pulse stimuli. The artificial neurons can dynamically respond to continuous inputs from moving objects, encoding motion features (such as velocity, direction, and acceleration), into compressed feature maps for accurate classification and trajectory prediction. Our biomimetic encoding and prediction framework offers a promising strategy for developing neuromorphic systems with biologically realistic behaviors that may rival the capabilities of the human brain in processing complex dynamic information.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial Damage Enhances Immunogenic Cell Death for Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal nanoparticles (LMPs) exhibit tumor&#8208;targeting self&#8208;assembly and fuse intracellularly in cancer cells, releasing Ga3+ ions that disrupt mitochondrial function by substituting for iron. In combination with irreversible electroporation (IRE), this approach amplifies immunogenic cell death(ICD) and triggers a robust antitumor immune response, offering a potent synergistic strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








ABSTRACT
Cancer vaccines face limitations due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the low immunogenicity of tumor antigens. Immunogenic cell death (ICD), triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction, provides a promising strategy to enhance tumor antigen release and immune activation. However, actively amplifying mitochondrial damage&#8208;induced ICD remains challenging. In this study, we developed a vaccine in which liquid metal nanoparticles (LMPs) target tumor cells, undergo self&#8208;assembly and aggregation on the cell surface to achieve efficient uptake, fuse intracellularly to prolong retention, and release Ga3+ ions through an iron&#8208;substitution pathway to induce mitochondrial damage, thereby triggering ICD. In combination with irreversible electroporation (IRE), this approach mediates durable tumor&#8208;specific immunotherapy. Specifically, LMPs target tumor cell integrin &#945;v&#946;6 to initiate self&#8208;assembly and aggregation, leading to efficient cellular internalization. Within the acidic lysosomal environment, LMPs undergo fusion and partially escape into the cytosol, enabling prolonged intracellular retention and sustained release of Ga3+ ions. The released Ga3+ disrupts mitochondrial structure and inhibits electron transport via iron substitution, resulting in pronounced mitochondrial damage. Synergistic IRE and LMPs increase the liberation of mitochondrial damage&#8208;associated DAMPs and tumor antigens, driving robust ICD and long&#8208;term systemic antitumor immunity. This dual&#8208;modality strategy provides a blueprint for nanomaterial&#8208;enabled amplification of ICD in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>The Mechanical Behaviors in Oxides: Beyond Brittleness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of deformation mechanisms across oxide nanostructures of all dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D). We systematically summarize the critical roles of lattice structure, defects, morphology, and size effects in governing their mechanical responses. Thus, this work establishes a crucial bridge between intrinsic micro&#8208;strain mechanisms and macroscopic engineering stress&#8211;strain curves.








ABSTRACT
Oxide materials are traditionally perceived as intrinsically brittle due to their strong covalent and ionic bonds, which hinder plastic deformation and limit their applicability in emerging technologies such as flexible and wearable electronics. Over the past two decades, various strategies have broken through this paradigm, endowing crystalline oxides with unconventional mechanical properties, such as ultra&#8208;flexibility, super&#8208;elasticity, and enhanced ductility. These breakthroughs have uncovered a diverse range of distinct deformation mechanisms, encompassing size effects, mobile point defects, dislocation activities, domain switching, phase transitions, and the role of engineered artificial structures. In this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the fundamental principles governing these behaviors across different dimensions of oxide nanostructures (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D). At the same time, the most commonly used mechanical characterization techniques for each dimension are combined to explore how the dynamical process of each mechanism is influenced by mechanical loading modes, such as in situ tensile, compressive, or bending tests. Finally, we outline the future directions and challenges in this field, with an emphasis on the design of oxide materials for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics and other advanced applications.

         <title>Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvents&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Density Networks for Ambient Multi&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Multifunctional and Extreme Environment Adaptable Soft Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) strategy utilizing a cationic monomer was developed to enable high&#8208;density (&gt; 20 wt.%) lignosulfonate&#8208;interconnected dynamic networks, affording ambient&#8208;air gelation across multi&#8208;scales in minutes, enhanced mechanical/interfacial robustness, and excellent photothermal and ion&#8208;conducting features. This facilitates in situ manufacturing of wearable power/sensing devices and miniaturized organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) arrays, exhibiting well&#8208;maintained performances under extreme environmental conditions.








ABSTRACT
Skin&#8208;like soft electronics exploiting gels containing biomass&#8208;derived components raise increasing research attention, in which multifunctional lignin has been extensively explored. Nevertheless, elevating the lignin loading usually sacrifices the performance, limiting their application potentials. Herein, we develop a unique polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) consisting of a quaternary ammonium monomer and lactic acid to incorporate with high&#8208;density lignosulfonate (LS) of &gt; 20 wt.% and address the performance trade&#8208;offs. The lignin&#8208;induced self&#8208;catalytic polymerization associated with electrostatic assembly enables room temperature gelation within &lt; 5&#160;min and ambient&#8208;air micropatterning. Remarkably, the anionic LS and polycationic matrix affording multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions drastically enhance the mechanical strength to &gt; 1&#160;MPa and versatile adhesion up to &gt; 500&#160;kPa, meanwhile allowing self&#8208;healing, photothermal, and antibacterial capabilities. Such LS&#8208;PDES eutectogels also permit ion conduction (&gt; 3 mS cm&#8722;1) and superior environmental adaptivity over &#8722;80&#176;C to 100&#176;C. Thus, employing the in situ polymerization between electrodes, rapid prototyping of bend&#8208;/impact&#8208;resistant flexible supercapacitors is demonstrated to power wearable sensors. More importantly, it facilitates the production of miniaturized soft organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) arrays, whose performance can be well maintained under deformed and extreme temperature conditions. This high&#8208;lignin&#8208;density eutectogel platform paves a straightforward route towards printed soft ionotronics, bioelectronic interfaces, and brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Programmable Metasurface With Zero Static Power Based on Liquid Metal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of liquid metal, a grating&#8208;structured microfluidic chip, and a passive metasurface facilitates the attainment of programmable reflection and transmission characteristics, thereby yielding a dual&#8208;functional programmable metasurface (DFPM) that operates with zero static power. The microfluidic chip utilizes a grating structure to enable individual control over each unit, significantly reducing both the complexity and cost of fabrication and control.








ABSTRACT
The switching devices based on metasurfaces suffer from high power consumption,&#160;metal fatigue, and unforeseen crosstalk. To address these challenges, liquid metal has been explored as a novel approach to reconfigure passive metasurfaces with zero static power. The integration of liquid metal, a grating&#8208;structured microfluidic chip, and a passive metasurface enables to achieve programmable reflection and transmission characteristics, rendering a dual&#8208;functional programmable metasurface (DFPM). Specifically, DFPM can realize the programmable reflection phases by tuning the passive metasurface with liquid metal. In addition, upon being decoupled from the passive metasurface, the microfluidic chip transforms into an independent liquid metal metasurface that exhibits programmable transmission resonant frequencies, a feature that holds promising applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The microfluidic chip employs a grating structure to achieve individual control over each unit, significantly reducing the complexity&#160;and cost of fabrication and control. Moreover, when applied in MRI, this grating structured microfluidic metasurface offers exceptionally uniform magnetic field enhancement capability and a broad frequency tuning range. Significantly, the flexible microfluidic substrate and liquid metal enhance the conformal adaptability of the metasurface, positioning it as a promising candidate for wearable devices and flexible electronics.

         <title>Maximize the Electrocatalytic Activity of Pt Toward Ethanol Oxidation via Engineering PdPt1 Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maximizing atomic utilization of Pt is crucial for efficient electrocatalysis.&#160;We constructed a tensile&#8208;strained PdPt1 single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) skin by implanting atomically dispersed Pt onto the surface of intermetallic Pd5Bi3 core&#8208;ultrathin Pd shell octahedrons, fully exposing active Pt atoms to boost ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis. Compared with the initial PdBi&#8208;Pt1, the PdPt1 SAA skin remarkably boosts the mass activity by 321.7 times. 








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) emerge as an intriguing model system for electrocatalysis by combining the advantages of single&#8208;atom catalysts and nanoalloys, yet it faces the challenge in engineering their surface structure at the atomic level. Herein, to fully utilize active Pt sites to boost ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis, single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atoms anchored onto the surface of intermetallic Pd5Bi3 core&#8208;ultrathin Pd shell octahedrons, namely a tensile&#8208;strained PdPt1 SAA skin, were rationally designed and engineered. This unique PdPt1 SAA skin achieves a record&#8208;high mass activity (553.58 A mgPt&#8722;1 or 34.73 A mgPt+Pd&#8722;1) and outstanding durability toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline electrolyte, outperforming the current high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the isolated&#8208;Pt&#8208;atoms effectively enhance the adsorption of ethanol, accelerate the C2 pathway, and enhance the C&#8208;C bond cleavage of the *CH2CO intermediate. The wet&#8208;chemical fabrication of SAA skin opens up a general strategy to construct model surface that completely exposes and stabilizes active atoms, facilitating the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Fluoropolymer&#8208;Mediated Delivery of a Dual TSHR/IGF1R&#8208;Targeting CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 System for Localized Therapy in Thyroid&#8208;Associated Ophthalmopathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoropolymer&#8208;based CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 platform, G4F7&#8208;CRISPR, enables dual&#8208;gene editing of TSHR and IGF1R in orbital tissues, effectively reducing adipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis in thyroid&#8208;associated ophthalmopathy. This localized gene therapy demonstrates superior efficacy and safety over current treatments, advancing precision medicine strategies for autoimmune orbital disorders.








ABSTRACT
Thyroid&#8208;associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), a vision&#8208;threatening and disfiguring autoimmune orbital disorder, remains a therapeutic challenge due to the lack of therapies with orbital specificity, sustained efficacy, and minimal side effects. Herein, we present G4F7&#8208;CRISPR, a fluoropolymer&#8208;based CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 delivery platform engineered for localized and efficient disruption of thyroid&#8208;stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and insulin&#8208;like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), two key mediators of TAO pathogenesis. G4F7&#8208;CRISPR achieved high insertion/deletion frequencies in primary orbital fibroblasts (Tshr: 37.2%; Igf1r: 42.8%) and mature adipocytes (Tshr: 22.4%; Igf1r: 24.3%), and maintained robust editing efficiency in orbital adipose tissue of TAO mouse models (Tshr: 30.7%; Igf1r: 32.4%). In both TAO mouse models and 3D human orbital organoids, dual&#8208;gene editing of Tshr and Igf1r via G4F7&#8208;CRISPR significantly suppressed orbital adipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis, demonstrating superior therapeutic efficacy over either single&#8208;gene approaches. Comprehensive off&#8208;target analyses in both TAO mouse models and orbital organoids revealed minimal off&#8208;target activity. Furthermore, G4F7&#8208;CRISPR exhibited excellent short&#8208; and long&#8208;term ocular and systemic safety in TAO mouse models. Notably, it outperformed teprotumumab&#8212;the FDA&#8208;approved therapy for TAO&#8212;in both therapeutic efficacy and safety, highlighting its potential clinical advantages. Collectively, these findings highlight the translational promise of G4F7&#8208;CRISPR as a safe, precise, and clinically viable gene therapy for TAO.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors are emerging as promising platforms for neuromorphic devices that emulate neuronal and synaptic activities and can seamlessly integrate with biological systems. This review focuses on resultant organic artificial neurons, synapses, and integrated devices, with an emphasis on their ability to perform neuromorphic functions and diverse applications in neuromorphic computing and flexible biointerfaces.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering, an interdisciplinary field bridging bioelectronics and neuroscience, endeavors to address the bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture by constructing hardware&#8208;level artificial neural networks (ANNs) and replicate the complicated architecture and functionality of the human brain, heralding a new era of intelligent sensing, processing, and computing systems. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which operate via the bulk doping of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors, are emerging as promising platforms for neuromorphic devices that emulate neuronal and synaptic activities while seamlessly integrating with biological systems. OECTs offer several advantages, including compatibility with flexible and stretchable substrates, tunable ionic and electronic conductivity, multimodal sensing capability, and operation at low voltages. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vista of the rapidly advancing field of OECT&#8208;based neuromorphic devices, including organic electrochemical neurons, organic electrochemical synapses, and their integrated devices. Particular emphasis is placed on their ability to perform neuromorphic functions and diverse applications in neuromorphic computing and flexible biointerfaces. Conclusions, remaining challenges, and future prospects for the development of OECT&#8208;based neuromorphic devices are finally outlined.

         <title>(Zn,Ti)O Electron Transport Layer Enables the Highest Conversion Efficiency in Cd&#8208;Free Sb2Se3 Photocathodes for Stable Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an approach to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of Cd&#8208;free Sb2Se3 photocathodes by incorporating (Zn,Ti)O electron transport layer and subjecting it to heterojunction annealing. It demonstrates remarkable optimization of charge carrier dynamics. The champion device delivers a record half&#8208;cell solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.27% for a single photocathode and an unbiased 2.50% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency for Sb2Se3&#8208;BiVO4 photocathode&#8208;photoanode tandem cell.








ABSTRACT
Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has emerged as a promising photocathode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC)&#8208;driven solar hydrogen production due to its low toxicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and excellent photoelectric properties. Currently, efficient Sb2Se3 photocathodes are mostly coupled with CdS electron transport layer (ETL), however, suffering from natural toxicity, parasitic light absorption, and interfacial mismatch and/or instability. In this study, we introduce a Cd&#8208;free Sb2Se3 photocathode with an atomic layer deposition&#8208;processed (Zn,Ti)O ETL, which mitigates the respective limitations of binary oxides (i.e., ZnO and TiO2). The optimized (Zn,Ti)O ETL enhances electron carrier density, establishes a favorable &#8216;spike&#8208;like&#8217; band alignment at the Sb2Se3/(Zn,Ti)O interface, significantly improves charge separation and transport efficiencies, as well as the stability. Consequently, the champion device achieves an impressive photocurrent density (Jph) of 31.1&#160;mA/cm2, a record half&#8208;cell solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (HC&#8208;STH) efficiency of 5.27% for Cd&#8208;free Sb2Se3 photocathodes, and the highest unbiased STH efficiency of 2.50% in the Sb2Se3&#8208;BiVO4 tandem cell, setting a new benchmark for eco&#8208;friendly and high&#8208;performance PEC processed green hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops an approach to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of Cd-free Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathodes by incorporating (Zn,Ti)O electron transport layer and subjecting it to heterojunction annealing. It demonstrates remarkable optimization of charge carrier dynamics. The champion device delivers a record half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.27% for a single photocathode and an unbiased 2.50% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode-photoanode tandem cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony selenide (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has emerged as a promising photocathode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC)-driven solar hydrogen production due to its low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and excellent photoelectric properties. Currently, efficient Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathodes are mostly coupled with CdS electron transport layer (ETL), however, suffering from natural toxicity, parasitic light absorption, and interfacial mismatch and/or instability. In this study, we introduce a Cd-free Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode with an atomic layer deposition-processed (Zn,Ti)O ETL, which mitigates the respective limitations of binary oxides (i.e., ZnO and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The optimized (Zn,Ti)O ETL enhances electron carrier density, establishes a favorable &#8216;spike-like&#8217; band alignment at the Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/(Zn,Ti)O interface, significantly improves charge separation and transport efficiencies, as well as the stability. Consequently, the champion device achieves an impressive photocurrent density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;) of 31.1&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a record half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) efficiency of 5.27% for Cd-free Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathodes, and the highest unbiased STH efficiency of 2.50% in the Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tandem cell, setting a new benchmark for eco-friendly and high-performance PEC processed green hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Innate Immune&#8208;Cloaked Microgel&#8208;Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reverse Persistent Pulmonary Fibrosis via Reparative Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft microgel coating is developed with a &#8220;self&#8221; peptide that helps mesenchymal stromal cells evade innate immune clearance. These engineered cells reverse fibrosis through secreted signals. Single&#8208;cell analysis reveals a special macrophage type that drives healing. This approach enables a living pharmacy for long&#8208;term tissue repair.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material&#8208;based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self&#8208;marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen&#8208;presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long&#8208;term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.

         <title>Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro&#8208;wrinkles and a temperature&#8208;sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi&#8208;scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide&#8208;range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun&#8208;heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non&#8208;volatile low&#8208;emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual&#8208;mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glass&#8208;Unified MOF Membranes for High&#8208;Efficiency Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy enables the fabrication of defect&#8208;free MOF membranes through integration with melt&#8208;quenched coordination polymer glass. These advanced membranes possess densely interconnected nanochannels that facilitate high&#8208;efficiency molecular separations in organic solvent nanofiltration, pervaporation, and gas separation, respectively, and tunable separation performance through non&#8208;destructive modification.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate significant potential as separation membranes in energy&#8208;efficient industrial applications. Nevertheless, fabricating an arbitrary MOF membrane with intrinsic separation capability remains a persistent challenge due to intercrystalline defects, necessitating case&#8208;specific optimization of synthesis conditions for different separation targets. Herein, the first coordination polymer (CP) glass&#8208;unified MOF (GUM) membranes are fabricated by a melt&#8208;quenching approach, establishing a tunable and facile strategy for on&#8208;demand MOF membrane fabrication. The three types of Zr&#8208;GUM, Al&#8208;GUM, and Zn&#8208;GUM membranes with different Zr&#8208;, Al&#8208;, Zn&#8208;MOFs are defect&#8208;free and feature high&#8208;density, interconnected, selective nanochannels that dominate the transport process. This strategy enables precise and rapid molecular separation in organic solvent nanofiltration, isomer pervaporation, and gas separation. Meanwhile, through non&#8208;destructive modification of MOF crystals, the separation performance can be precisely fine&#8208;tuned without compromising the structural integrity of the GUM membrane. Furthermore, leveraging the meltability of CP glass, this strategy enables the fabrication of innovative defect&#8208;free membranes with integrated self&#8208;healing properties. The GUM membranes demonstrate sustained high&#8208;efficiency separation performance coupled with exceptional mechanical robustness, chemical resistance, and thermal stability, providing a facile strategy for both gas and liquid membrane separations.

         <title>Ultrasound Active Piezoelectric Nanostimulators for Long&#8208;Acting Wireless Deep Brain Electric Stimulation to Inhibit Epileptic Seizures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles are explored as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation. These nanostimulators can adhere to the neuronal membrane and generate electrical signals under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound to precisely activate neurons and associated neural circuits through triggering voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels. Piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based stimulation can effectively suppress epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models.








Abstract
Electrical deep brain stimulation is effective for epilepsy suppression, but will lead to neural tissue damage and inflammation due to implantation of electrodes and a pulse generator. Transcranial magnetic and transcranial ultrasound stimulation cannot directly generate effective electrical signals in deep brain regions. Here, the use of piezoelectric nanoparticles is proposed as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation and minimally invasive suppression of epilepsy. Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanostimulators can adhere to neuronal membrane and generate pulsed electrical signals under ultrasound irradiation, effectively activating neurons through modulating voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels on the membrane. These nanostimulators can be minimal&#8208;invasively implanted into target deep brain regions, such as the hippocampal CA1, through stereotactic microinjection and remain stable for at least 14 weeks with negligible inflammatory reactions. These implanted nanostimulators precisely and effectively activate surrounding neurons and associated neural circuits in vivo under a portable low&#8208;intensity ultrasound transducer. This piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based wireless deep brain electrical stimulation effectively suppresses epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models. By combining the deep penetration of ultrasound with the efficacy of piezoelectric stimulation, this minimally invasive method holds great promise for effective suppression of epileptic seizures and management of other neural disorders.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Wettability Triboelectric Sensors for Sweat Collection and Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bioinspired triboelectric material with heterogeneous wettability, which is used to construct a lightweight, self&#8208;powered wearable sweat sensor. By integrating an ion&#8208;selective membrane and a wireless transmission module, the device enables selective detection of salt ions and real&#8208;time remote monitoring, offering notable potential for long&#8208;term, continuous health monitoring applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric sweat sensors, endowed with the technical advantages of non&#8208;invasive ex vivo and in situ detection, have catalyzed the rapid advancement of personalized medicine and precision health management systems. However, the inherently low secretion rate and rapid evaporation of sweat pose significant challenges for its efficient collection and rapid analytical screening. This study leverages laser cutting and aqueous interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategies to develop a biomimetic heterogeneous wettability triboelectric material (HWTM). Sweat is rapidly collected from the edge to the center of the material, driven by the combined effect of a wettability gradient and the Laplace pressure difference arising from asymmetric curvature at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. This collection mechanism markedly enriches target analytes, yielding a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 51&#160;dB, which surpasses that of prevailing sweat sensor technologies. A portable wearable patch is engineered by integrating ion&#8208;selective membranes and data processing modules, enabling selective salt ion profiling and real&#8208;time wireless monitoring. This work paves the way for the rational design of sweat sensors grounded in fluidic transport mechanisms.

         <title>Unique Impacts of Scandium Doping on Electrode Performance of P&#8217;2&#8208; and P2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural stability during electrochemical cycling for P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3MnO2 as a positive electrode for of Na&#8208;ion battery is investigated by modulating the materials via metal substitution and varying the degree of Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion. The cycle stability is maximized when combining Sc doping and the lattice distortion, demonstrating &gt; 300 cycles in the coin&#8208;type full cell.








Abstract

Layered sodium manganese oxides are one of the promising candidates as cathode materials for high&#8208;capacity Na&#8208;ion batteries free from rare elements. Among the polytypes of layered sodium manganese oxides, the P&#8217;2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2&#160;electrode exhibits the highest reversible capacity &#8776;220 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 based on the Mn3+/4+&#160;redox couple; however, the cycle life remained&#160;a significant challenge. Because of Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) active Mn3+&#160;ions ([Ar]4s23d4), the layered structure is cooperatively distorted and experiences complex structural changes during Mn3+/4+&#160;redox accompanied by Na extraction/insertion. The impact of scandium(III) dopant in Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2&#160;on the cooperative lattice&#8208;distortion and electrode performance is systematically investigated, and prepartion for distortion&#8208;free hexagonal P2&#8208;type Na2/3[(Mn1&#8208;xScx)0.93&#9633;0.07]O2&#160;(&#9633; = vacancy) allows the contribution of the vacancies on the Mn site to be checked. Furthermore, a comparative study of the case of other trivalent metals of yttrium(III) and aluminum(III) as dopants is demonstrated. Thus, it is concluded that a unique synergetic effect of the Sc doping and JT distortion provides significant improvement of redox activity of P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2, demonstrating stable cycling for more than 300 cycles in a Na&#8208;ion cell. The findings highlight the critical role of the coexistence of the Sc dopant and honeycomb ordering of MnIV(MnIII1&#8208;xScIIIx) in [Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2&#160;slabs of P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2 on the stable redox for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Endogenous Metal Ion&#8208;Enriched Immunostimulating Biomimetic Scaffold Improves In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel endogenous metal ion&#8208;enriched immunostimulation&#8208;amplified bone biomimetic scaffold (emia&#8208;BBS) is developed, which features bone&#8208;like nanostructures, mechanical properties, and enhanced surface adhesion, enabling efficient capture of endogenous metal ions to amplify ion&#8208;mediated immunomodulation. This study introduces an immunomodulatory strategy that harnesses endogenous ion dynamics to amplify regenerative signals, providing a precisely guided and clinically applicable approach for critical&#8208;sized bone defect repair.








ABSTRACT
Effective in situ regeneration and functional reconstruction of large&#8208;scale bone defects remain a formidable clinical challenge. The endogenous metal ions have been shown to critically regulate immune responses and bone remodeling, but methods for precisely regulating the spatiotemporal recruitment dynamics of endogenous ions are still lacking. Here, we develop a novel endogenous metal ion&#8208;enriched immunostimulation&#8208;amplified&#160;bone biomimetic scaffold (emia&#8208;BBS) based on the hierarchical multi&#8208;level assembly of nano&#8208;hydroxyapatites (nHAs), collagen fibrils, and mussel adhesion proteins (MAPs). The emia&#8208;BBS not only mimics the nanostructure and mechanical properties of native bone, but notably, the assembled MAPs endow emia&#8208;BBS with abundant lysine and dopamine chemical structures, enabling efficient capture of endogenous metal ions to amplify ion&#8208;mediated immunomodulation. Functionally, in large&#8208;scale mandibular defects, emia&#8208;BBS&#8208;induced enrichment of endogenous metal ions could recruit and reprogram macrophages, thereby enhancing the innate immune response. These M2 macrophages, recruited by the emia&#8208;BBS&#8208;metal ion complex, in turn, facilitate the recruitment and osteogenic activation of endogenous LepR&#8314; skeletal stem cells via the CCL5/CCR5/STAT3 axis. This study introduces an immunomodulatory strategy that harnesses endogenous ion dynamics to amplify regenerative signals, providing a precisely guided and clinically applicable approach for critical&#8208;sized bone defect repair.

         <title>Porous Bi2S3 Bulk With Excellent Thermoelectric Performance by Solid States Replacement and Low Melting&#8208;Point Metal Volatilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing FeCoNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy, the bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) material achieves a record&#8208;high ZT of 1.1 at 773 K, owing to the solid&#8208;states replacement reaction and the volatilization of low melting&#8208;point metal. This strategy is also applicable to other sulfur&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. 








Abstract
Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) exhibits potentials in thermoelectric field, due to their environmental friendliness, high Seebeck coefficients, and low thermal conductivity. However, the peak ZT for binary Bi2S3 does not exceed 1.0, inhibiting its practical applications. Starting from the precipitation smelting of bismuth concentrate process, this study constructs multi&#8208;type, multi&#8208;scale in&#8208;situ secondary phases and porous structures through FeCoNi (FCN) medium&#8208;entropy alloy addition, significantly enhancing the ZT value of Bi2S3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The introduced FCN reacts with pre&#8208;synthesized Bi2S3 nanorod matrix during spark plasma sintering and forms precipitate complex with FCN&#8208;S core and Bi shell microstructures. FCN doping improves the carrier concentration of Bi2S3 and the reduced Bi from Bi2S3 acts as carrier transport channels for mobility optimization. Due to the stacking effect of Bi2S3 nanorods and the volatile nature of metallic Bi, porous Bi2S3 structure is formed, characterized by randomly&#8208;distributed and micro&#8208;to&#8208;nanoscale pores. The coexistence of various lattice defects effectively scatter phonons and suppress the lattice thermal conductivity, thus an excellent peak ZT of 1.1 is achieved at 773 K in a 0.25&#160;wt.% FCN&#8208;doped Bi2S3 sample. This study, drawing on the process of ore smelting, proposes a convenient method for preparing high&#8208;performance chalcogenide thermoelectric materials with porous structures.

However, the peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; for binary Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not exceed 1.0, inhibiting its practical applications. Starting from the precipitation smelting of bismuth concentrate process, this study constructs multi-type, multi-scale in-situ secondary phases and porous structures through FeCoNi (FCN) medium-entropy alloy addition, significantly enhancing the &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based thermoelectric materials. The introduced FCN reacts with pre-synthesized Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanorod matrix during spark plasma sintering and forms precipitate complex with FCN-S core and Bi shell microstructures. FCN doping improves the carrier concentration of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the reduced Bi from Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acts as carrier transport channels for mobility optimization. Due to the stacking effect of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods and the volatile nature of metallic Bi, porous Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure is formed, characterized by randomly-distributed and micro-to-nanoscale pores. The coexistence of various lattice defects effectively scatter phonons and suppress the lattice thermal conductivity, thus an excellent peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.1 is achieved at 773 K in a 0.25&#160;wt.% FCN-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sample. This study, drawing on the process of ore smelting, proposes a convenient method for preparing high-performance chalcogenide thermoelectric materials with porous structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Conductivity Optimization Toward High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Electronic structure reorganization of Li2S enables synergistic ionic&#8208;electronic conduction, unlocking exceptional cycling stability (97.5% retention over 1000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1), which highlights a promising path for practical ASSLSBs.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) hold great promise as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density. However, the practical application of sulfur&#8208;based cathodes are largely hampered by their sluggish reaction kinetics, especially under high current densities and long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, by employing electronic structure modulation via same&#8208;group element doping, we successfully engineer lithium sulfide to concurrently facilitate ionic diffusion and electronic conduction, thereby significantly boosting its reaction kinetics. The formation of Se&#9472;S bonds, achieved by partial Se substitution, reorganizes the electronic structure of Li2S. This effect concurrently weakens sulfur's electronegativity to facilitate Li+ diffusion and narrows the bandgap to boost electronic conduction. As a result, the Li2Se0.2S0.8 cathode exhibits remarkable high&#8208;rate capability, retaining 97.5% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, a full cell combining Li2Se0.2S0.8 with a Si anode delivers a high energy density of 1324&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, highlighting the feasibility of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy and high safety ASSLSBs. This work provides an effective strategy toward high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power solid&#8208;state batteries.

Infrared Camouflage
This adaptive metaskin integrates a plasmonic MXene metasurface with a temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomer to realize dual&#8208;mode active and passive thermal camouflage. It enables important objects, such as vehicles and personnel, to precisely match the thermal signatures of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature backgrounds, achieving seamless blending with the environment and evading infrared detection. More details can be found in the Research Article by Keqiao Li, Yang Li, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506934).

Interface Segregation in Dielectrics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202507233), Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung and co&#8208;workers overturn the long&#8208;standing reliance on multiple additives and costly rare&#8208;earth elements in MLCCs by demonstrating that a single acceptor&#8208;type additive enables superior dielectric performance. Through atomic&#8208;scale grain&#8208;boundary segregation in nanocrystalline BaTiO3, they achieve dielectric loss below 0.8% up to 100 MHz and under 2.5% up to 1 GHz, while maintaining high effective permittivity even under electric fields as high as 80 kV/cm and exhibiting excellent temperature stability.

Engineering Aging
This illustration is a metaphorical representation of in vitro aging models. The engineers (cells) start their careers working with robust, well&#8208;maintained equipment (healthy tissue), and as time passes, they grow older, and their equipment eventually fails. These elements combine to form an accelerated aging model that can be studied to uncover some of the mysteries of the aging process. More details can be found in the Perspective by Khoon S. Lim and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512523).

Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503524), Behnam Akhavan and co&#8208;workers address the long&#8208;standing challenge of bonding hydrogels to solid polymer substrates by introducing a universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy using plasma&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species. This scalable, linker&#8208;free method enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.

Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511754), Ferhat Katmis, Valeria Lauter, Mehmet C. Onbasli, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field stabilization of interfacial skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings in EuS/Bi2Se3/EuS trilayers. Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interactions and geometric confinement enable robust topological spin textures directly imaged by Lorentz TEM and confirmed by micromagnetic models, magnetometry and neutron reflectometry. These findings establish a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic technologies based on stable topological information carriers.

         <title>Probiotic&#8208;Based Materials as Living Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Engineered Living Materials are highlighted, integrating synthetic biology and advanced materials, with a focus on probiotic&#8208;based therapeutics. Probiotic Living Materials hold great potential for biosensing, infection treatment, osteogenesis, wound healing, vaginal and gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer therapy. breakthroughs in the field is critically reviewed, including challenges for clinical translation.








Abstract
The growing demand for safer, more targeted therapeutics requires the development of advanced biomaterials. Among these, Engineered Living Materials (ELMs)&#8212;which integrate synthetic biology with material science&#8212;are emerging as promising platforms for biomedical applications. This review focuses on a subclass of ELMs based on genetically engineered probiotics combined with matrices, that are termed Probiotic Living Materials (PLMs) to differentiate them from Living Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs). Recent studies highlight PLM's potential in addressing different health conditions, offering targeted and dynamic therapies. However, PLMs face multiple challenges to be implemented in clinics, including a lack of robust genetic toolkits for probiotic engineering, concerns about biosafety (e.g., horizontal gene transfer or non&#8208;desirable biological activity), difficulties in translating preclinical results to humans, and the absence of clear regulatory guidance for clinical use. This review first explores the fundamental features of ELMs, then provides an overview of probiotics, followed by recent advances in the design of engineered PLMs for biomedical applications, particularly in biosensing development, infection treatment, bone repair, wound healing, vaginal imbalances, gut&#8208;related conditions, and cancer therapy. Finally, biosafety issues and current gaps in regulatory frameworks to ensure safe and effective use of PLMs, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations, are discussed.

         <title>Bioactive Materials&#8208;Mediated Regulation of Bone Marrow Microenvironment: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterials that regulate the bone marrow microenvironment (encompassing osteocytes, stem cells, immune cells, nerves, and blood vessels). It introduces the action mechanisms of various materials and the limitations of current research, while outlining the development potential of biomaterials and their transformative impacts on medical paradigms.








Abstract
The bone marrow microenvironment(BME) maintains bone homeostasis through multi&#8208;cellular cooperation and signal crosstalk, its&#160;dysregulation drives&#160;pathological bone&#160;loss. In recent years, Materiobiology, a scientific discipline studying how biomaterial properties affect biological functions, has opened new avenues for the precise regulation of this complex microenvironment. Biomaterials enable sophisticated regulation of the BME through biomimetic design and functionalization strategies. They not only activate osteoblast signaling pathways to promote bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption functions. Additionally, they integrate nerve and vascular regeneration processes with immunomodulatory mechanisms to optimize stem cell behavior and improve the tissue repair microenvironment. This review comprehensively summarizes advances in biomaterial&#8208;mediated BME regulation, emphasizing interdisciplinary integration and intelligent material development to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. The innovation of intelligent materials lies in their ability to mimic biological systems. Recent research has leveraged generative design models to engineer new thiol&#8208;containing antimicrobial peptides. These approaches achieve spatiotemporal coordination of cellular interactions and functional reconstruction during bone regeneration. Future efforts need to address challenges in material stability, personalized adaptation, and clinical translation, promoting cross&#8208;scale therapeutic innovation from molecular intervention to tissue regeneration, providing revolutionary solutions for bone metabolic diseases and complex defect repair.

They not only activate osteoblast signaling pathways to promote bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption functions. Additionally, they integrate nerve and vascular regeneration processes with immunomodulatory mechanisms to optimize stem cell behavior and improve the tissue repair microenvironment. This review comprehensively summarizes advances in biomaterial-mediated BME regulation, emphasizing interdisciplinary integration and intelligent material development to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. The innovation of intelligent materials lies in their ability to mimic biological systems. Recent research has leveraged generative design models to engineer new thiol-containing antimicrobial peptides. These approaches achieve spatiotemporal coordination of cellular interactions and functional reconstruction during bone regeneration. Future efforts need to address challenges in material stability, personalized adaptation, and clinical translation, promoting cross-scale therapeutic innovation from molecular intervention to tissue regeneration, providing revolutionary solutions for bone metabolic diseases and complex defect repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diverse Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and perspectives for diverse categories of perovskite solar cells classified according to composition, dimension, and crystallinity are overviewed.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and structural flexibility. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of perovskite solar cells has reached 27%, making perovskite materials a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. Although numerous reviews regarding perovskite materials have been published, the existing reviews generally focus on individual material systems (e.g., organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites) and specific optimizations in one particular optoelectronic application (e.g., stability engineering for solar cells), lacking a systematic overview of the progress and challenges across diverse perovskite types. This review breaks this limitation by providing a systematic overview of all perovskite categories used in solar cells classified by different criteria, including composition (organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, all&#8208;inorganic perovskites, lead&#8208;free perovskites, and metal&#8208;free perovskites), dimensionality (3D and low&#8208;dimensional perovskitoids), and crystallinity (poly&#8208;crystal thin film and single&#8208;crystal perovskites). The recent progress and future perspectives for each category of perovskite solar cells are focused on, aiming to establish a holistic roadmap for perovskite solar cells toward technological innovations and industrial viability.

         <title>Hierarchically MOF&#8208;Based Porous Monolith Composites for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the design of hierarchical porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting, focusing on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous monoliths. Emphasis is placed on integrating MOF nanoscale porosity with the microscale channels of monolithic scaffolds to enhance sorption&#8208;desorption performance. The role of multiscale porosity, from the nanometer scale to the macrostructure, is highlighted in optimizing water uptake, vapor transport, and stability under varying humidity.








Abstract
Water scarcity, a critical global challenge, has intensified due to the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and its detrimental impact on human activities. Addressing this issue requires solutions capable of providing clean water in regions facing hydroclimatic challenges and limited infrastructure. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising solution, particularly in arid regions, by extracting moisture from the air. This review explores AWH technologies that leverage material porosity and hygroscopicity, focusing on highly porous materials such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and monolithic scaffolds. While MOFs exhibit exceptional water uptake due to their tunable chemistry and nanoscale porosity, their powdery nature poses stability and processability challenges. To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano&#8208;scale in MOF (&lt;2 nm) and micro&#8208;scales (&gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF&#8208;based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large&#8208;scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrocatalytic Materials in Zn&#8208;Air Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) applications, systematically addressing their physicochemical characteristics, design paradigms, characterization techniques, and cutting&#8208;edge advancements. The current review can provide a valuable foundation for the selection of elements and the design of HEMs for bifunctional catalysts, as well as for the optimization of HEM compositions to enhance their intrinsic activity.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high energy density, low costs, and environmental sustainability by using air as the cathode and zinc as the anode. The critical bottlenecks in advancing rechargeable ZABs lie in the development of high&#8208;performance bifunctional air electrode catalysts that efficiently drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), comprising four or more elements with distinctive structural characteristics, tailorable chemical compositions, and correspondingly tunable functional properties, have exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity toward ORR/OER in various catalytic systems. To further enhance HEMs' catalytic performance, systematic investigations into elemental interactions, precise identification of active sites, and elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms are imperative. This review first introduces the synthetic methods, design principles, and characterization technologies of HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and summarizes their applications in ZABs based on oxygen chemistry. This study endeavors to decode the complexity of active sites, elemental interactions, and the reaction mechanisms intrinsic to HEMs. Finally, the critical challenges, the significance of integrating both experimental and theoretical approaches, and the prospective applications of HEMs in ZABs are emphasized. This review is expected to facilitate the rational design and practical deployment of HEMs for next&#8208;generation ZAB systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) as multifunctional platforms for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), highlighting their structural tunability, diverse therapeutic modalities, and broad biomedical applications in oncology and infectious disease control. This review comprehensively emphasizes the design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and synergistic treatment strategies of emerging MBN, while also addressing current facing challenges in clinical translation.








Abstract
Advanced metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) represent a dynamic frontier in nanomedicine, offering a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Their tunable structures and catalytic, optical, and magnetic properties enable diverse nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), including photodynamic, chemodynamic, sonodynamic, thermodynamic, piezoelectric, radiodynamic, and magnetodynamic modalities. In addition to the well&#8208;established tumor ablation, MBNs also feature potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity, functioning via reactive oxygen species generation, immune modulation, and biofilm disruption. Recent developments in metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal&#8211;phenolic networks, and 2D metal nanosheets have expanded the toolkit for precision drug delivery, imaging&#8208;guided therapy, and bioresponsive release strategies. This comprehensive review highlights the structural design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and versatile biomedical applications of emerging MBN platforms, emphasizing synergistic treatment strategies and their role in overcoming hypoxia, multidrug resistance, and immunosuppression. Despite their promise, clinical translation remains hindered by unresolved issues in long&#8208;term biosafety, biodegradation, and scalable manufacturing. Future efforts are expected to focus on tailoring intelligent nanostructures with optimized pharmacokinetics, integrating multimodal imaging with real&#8208;time therapeutic feedback, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Continued innovation at the interface of materials science, biology, and medicine will be essential for transforming MBN&#8208;based systems into clinically viable tools for oncology, infectious disease control, and personalized medicine.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review dissects the primary failure mechanisms of sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes at low temperatures, such as sluggish ion transport and high interfacial resistance. It comprehensively summarizes key optimization strategies, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, and the development of novel additives and salts, offering a systematic guide for designing advanced electrolytes for reliable low&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
Given the abundance and low cost of sodium resources, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, the unique electrochemical and chemical characteristics of SIBs indicate their substantial potential for low&#8208;temperature operation. However, low temperatures significantly reduce the intrinsic Na+ transport rate, sharply increase the Na+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier at the battery&#8208;electrolyte interface, and lead to dynamic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) reconstruction, resulting in a substantial increase in interfacial impedance. These issues ultimately lead to severe capacity degradation, diminished power performance, shortened cycle life, and even complete battery failure at low temperatures. To address these challenges, this review thoroughly analyzes the failure mechanisms of electrolytes at low temperatures and comprehensively summarizes current design and optimization strategies for low&#8208;temperature SIB electrolytes, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, novel additives and sodium salts, and emerging electrolyte systems. Furthermore, it prospects the future development trends of organic electrolytes, aiming to provide insights for the advancement of novel low&#8208;temperature SIBs.

         <title>Optical, Electrical, Thermal, Stress, and Energy Yield Simulations Enhance the Performance and Stability of Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Device simulations are essential for uncovering efficiency losses and failure pathways in perovskite solar cells. This review summarizes device simulations across five fundamental domains, including optical management, electrical processes, thermal effects, mechanical stress, and energy output. In addition, it provides insight into high&#8208;throughput and AI&#8208;assisted multiphysics modeling in advancing future photovoltaic technologies.








Abstract
Device simulations have become indispensable tools for advancing the performance and deepening the understanding of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These simulations enable a systematic exploration of light management strategies, charge transport mechanisms, and device architecture optimization. This review comprehensively highlights the critical role of modeling in the development of PSCs, with a focus on five key domains: optical management (light absorption, reflection, and scattering), electrical processes (carrier dynamics, defect passivation, and interface engineering), thermal effects (heat generation and dissipation), mechanical stress (structural stability and degradation mechanisms), and energy yield (real&#8208;world output power, performance improvement, and device degradation). The integration of multiphysics simulations to address complex device challenges and to accelerate the development of high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs is also discussed. Key achievements in tandem architecture optimization, interface engineering, and insights into device degradation pathways under real&#8208;world operating conditions are thoroughly summarized. Finally, remaining challenges, such as modeling non&#8208;idealities, the scalability of simulation approaches, and experimental validation, are identified, and offer an outlook on future directions in multiphysics modeling. By bridging theoretical and experimental perspectives, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of simulations in enabling higher performance, enhanced stability, and broader application of perovskite photovoltaics (PV) in sustainable energy systems.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Direct Lithium Extraction from Low&#8208;Quality Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes the structure&#8208;efficiency&#8208;application framework of solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems for lithium extraction from low&#8208;quality brines. It highlights fundamental mechanisms, integrated design, engineering applications, and device development of SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. The challenges and future perspective for the next generation of scale&#8208;up SDLE architectures are also supplemented.








Abstract
Owing to the crucial role in energy transformation for decarbonization, sustainable lithium (Li) supply has become growingly critical. Low&#8208;quality brines hold vast potential due to infinite reserves and diverse distribution but desire green and cost&#8208;effective extraction techniques against low Li concentrations and high magnesium&#8208;to&#8208;lithium ratios. Solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems combining conventional evaporation and DLE techniques can overcome the present challenges of Li extraction, promising to advance the exploitation of low&#8208;quality brines while simultaneously producing fresh water. However, the underlying construction principles and fundamental physical processes concerning SDLE systems are still uncovered comprehensively. This review first reveals the high&#8208;efficient and energy&#8208;effective Li extraction mechanisms from low&#8208;quality brines. Then, this work systematically presents construction and enhancement strategies, and the latest advancements and engineering applications of various SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. Furthermore, this work highlights the rational design of SDLE devices for water&#8208;Li co&#8208;production. Finally, this work discusses the challenges and future prospects for realizing SDLE systems from lab discovery to scale&#8208;up field demonstration. This review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and practical engineering behind the SDLE, unlocking different insights for resource sustainability and low&#8208;grade brines mining.

         <title>Terahertz Electronic and Spin Currents in Wafer&#8208;Scale Van der Waals Bi2Se3/WSe2 Heterostructures and Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures offer exciting possibilities for artificial materials with unique optical, electronic, and spintronic properties. However, their use in the terahertz (THz) range is limited due to material constraints. This study demonstrates scalable, large&#8208;area, crystalline 2D heterostructures, combining topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and ferromagnets. This enables a range of THz phenomena from spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, nonlinear down&#8208;conversion and magnetic proximity effects in a single heterostructure stack. Further, different TMD polymorphs &#8211; the crystal phase &#8208; significantly alter the THz responses, providing a pathway for advanced heterostructure engineering in 2D materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures and polymorphs have promised the realization of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, through an infinitely diverse set of 2D quantum materials and their stacking order in a single layered device. However, their exploitation for the terahertz range has been limited with most investigations based around the optical domain, owing to the use of exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, the combination of terahertz electronic and spin currents is demonstrated through the realization of large area complex crystalline heterostructures of topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and ferromagnets. This is demonstrated through down&#8208;conversion of optical beams into coherent terahertz currents, where the terahertz phase permits the decoupling of the physical phenomena, and bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, the role of different TMD polymorphs (stacking orders &#8208; 1T&#8242;, 2H, and 3R) is shown with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the material stack entirely changing the terahertz responses &#8211; both electrical and magnetic &#8208; of the artificial material. This allows to highlight ultrafast phenomena that combine both the electronic&#8208; and spin&#8208;based processes in these structures. The importance of the crystal symmetry on the magnetic properties through proximity effects is further demonstrated, showing a nonlinearity of magnetic origin as a result of the 1T&#8242; polymorph. As well as control of the terahertz currents through different polymorphs, this scalable integration of a set of highly diverse materials establishes a platform for next&#8208;generation 2D heterostructures that integrate photonic, electronic, and spintronic properties into device&#160;architectures.

         <title>Li&#8208;Well ZnO Memtransistors: High Reliability for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithium (Li)&#8208;well ZnO memtransistor integrates&#160;transistor switching and nonvolatile memory, akin to ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and floating gates, while enabling low&#8208;power operation via Li&#8314; ion migration. Li&#8314; ion migration and switching mechanisms were&#160;confirmed by 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array achieves 99.31% yield, and this scalable design supports neuromorphic computing and artificial neural network accelerators. 








Abstract
Memtransistors are active analog memory devices utilizing ionic memristive materials as channel layers. Since their introduction, the term &#8220;memtransistor&#8221; has widely been adopted for transistors exhibiting nonvolatile memory characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;A novel lithium (Li)-well ZnO memtransistor integrates&#160;transistor switching and nonvolatile memory, akin to ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) and floating gates, while enabling low-power operation via Li&#8314; ion migration. Li&#8314; ion migration and switching mechanisms were&#160;confirmed by 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memtransistors are active analog memory devices utilizing ionic memristive materials as channel layers. Since their introduction, the term &#8220;memtransistor&#8221; has widely been adopted for transistors exhibiting nonvolatile memory characteristics. Currently, memtransistor devices possessing both transistor on/off functionality and nonvolatile memory characteristics include ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) and charge-trap flash (floating gate), yet ionic memtransistors have not matched their performance. Here a facile and extendable lithium (Li)-well oxide memtransistor (LWOM) is reported as a promising candidate. Forming a Li well, analogous to an n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; well beneath electrodes in n-metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) processes, induces Li&#8314;-ion migration via write &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving analog memory characteristics through Schottky barrier modulation. LWOM enables low-voltage weight updates and precise gate-controlled weight update characteristics. Analysis via 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms Li-ion redistribution and the resistance-switching mechanism. A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array demonstrates 99.31% operational yield and successful weight updates to target conductance values. Fabricated using mature oxide semiconductor technology with a 230&#160;&#176;C thermal budget and a simple process, LWOM stands as a strong contender for next-generation nonvolatile memory and artificial neural network (ANN) acceleration hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Textile&#8208;Based Electromagnetic Audio Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current wearable audio interfaces exhibit sound&#8208;emitting function but compromise either acoustic performance or wearability, and lack sufficient robustness against unstructured conditions. A textile&#8208;based audio interface is proposed with robust actuation to address these challenges and demonstrate various human&#8208;machine interactive applications. 








Abstract
Textiles with inherently porous architectures are commonly employed for acoustic absorption. Although recent advances in textile&#8208;based audio interfaces have enabled sound emission, they lack robustness under unstructured conditions. Therefore, this study introduces a strategy that integrates textile structures with a durable actuation mechanism to overcome these limitations. Through optimized theoretical modeling, this study enhances the vibration amplitudes, effectively compensating for the intrinsic acoustic damping losses of textiles, achieving a relatively high and flat sound pressure level of 71.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#160;dB. Notably, the audio interface maintains stable performance under various mechanical deformations, including stretching, compression, bending, and twisting. Furthermore, this audio interface preserves the essential characteristics of textiles, such as washability and breathability, and remains fully functional even in extremely humid conditions, such as heavy perspiration. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated through three practical applications: sound&#8208;beanie, talking&#8208;cloth, and sound&#8208;sofa. In each case, this audio interface delivers high&#8208;quality acoustic performance and robustness to unstructured conditions. The proposed strategy is anticipated to enhance the design of wearable audio interfaces for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Switching via 180&#176; N&#233;el Vector Reversal in Pt/Cr2O3/Co Trilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector offers strong potential for ultrafast SOT&#8208;MRAM, though its mechanism remains debated. Here, such switching is reported in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 within a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer. The switching occurs via antiferromagnetic domain wall motion, leading to unconventional SOT behaviors in the Co layer, including reversed polarity, current&#8208;induced exchange bias modulation, and field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent switching ratios.








Abstract
The 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector induced by the spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) presents significant potential for ultradense and ultrafast antiferromagnetic SOT&#8208;magnetoresistive random&#8208;access memory. However, its experimental realization remains a topic of intense debate. Here, unequivocal evidence is provided for the SOT&#8208;induced 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in collinear antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 in a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer structure. It is demonstrated that the 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 can lead to the unconventional switching behavior of the Co layer on top of it. The switching polarity of the Co layer can be reversed after the insertion of the Cr2O3 layer. Moreover, the exchange bias directions are switched simultaneously with the Co layer. The switching ratio of the Co layer is sensitive to the antiferromagnetic states of Cr2O3 and can be tuned by field cooling. The results not only underpin the electrical switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 but are also beneficial for the development of antiferromagnetic&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Diatom&#8208;Inspired Scaffold for Infected Bone Defect Therapy: Achieving Stable Photothermal Properties and Coordinated Antibacterial&#8208;Osteogenic Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical structure of diatoms, this work presents a biomimetic bone repair scaffold based on copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer, achieving simultaneously efficient antibacterial performance at low temperatures, immune modulation, and bone regeneration.









Abstract

Bone defect therapy frequently encounters bacterial infections and chronic inflammation, which impair bone regeneration and threaten implant stability. Iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted attention due to cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and metabolic safety. However, iron oxide nanoparticles still struggle to balance low&#8208;temperature efficient antibacterial activity, effective immunomodulation, and bone regeneration. Therefore, inspired by diatoms, a multifunctional bone repair scaffold based on chitosan&#8208;hydroxyapatite (CH) is developed by integrating the multifunctional properties of copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer (CH/FeCu@SiO2). The &#8220;cytoskeleton&#8221; CH scaffold stabilizes the nanoparticles and supports tissue growth. The &#8220;chloroplast&#8221; Fe(Cu)OOH and the &#8220; frustule&#8221; SiO2 layer synergistically capture near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to generate localized mild hyperthermia (&#8776;42&#160;&#176;C), with the release of Cu2+ to achieve antibacterial effects (&gt;99%). In addition, Fe(Cu)OOH exhibits enzyme&#8208;like antioxidant activity, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) (69.20%) and thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization (1.64&#8208;fold), which protects stem cells and creates osteogenic immune microenvironment. Moreover, the mild hyperthermia and ion release upregulate the TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling pathway and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, promoting vascularized bone regeneration and defect repair (1.3&#8208;fold). Overall, this biomimetic scaffold, enabling synergistic antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic activities, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for infectious bone defects treatment.

         <title>Solubility&#8208;pKa Coupling Effect Tailored Nanoporous Nylon Aerogel Family with Multiple Thermomechanical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling effect to engineer a high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By controlling nylon crystallization assembly, various nylon aerogels with robust nanofiber skeletons are developed comparable to traditional high&#8208;performance aerogels, while possessing unique thermoplastic characteristics for functional aerogel thermomechanical processing.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in aerogels science, the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aerogels with their plastic processability remains unexplored owing to their inherent trade&#8208;off between skeletal rigidity and transformable processability.

&lt;p&gt;A universal solubility-pKa coupling effect to engineer a high-performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By controlling nylon crystallization assembly, various nylon aerogels with robust nanofiber skeletons are developed comparable to traditional high-performance aerogels, while possessing unique thermoplastic characteristics for functional aerogel thermomechanical processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite significant advancements in aerogels science, the fabrication of high-performance aerogels with their plastic processability remains unexplored owing to their inherent trade-off between skeletal rigidity and transformable processability. Herein, a universal solubility-pKa coupling-effect to engineer high-performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By modulating solubility parameters and acid dissociation constants in nylon-solvent systems, it is precisely control crystallization to assemble interlaced 1D nanofiber skeletons, yielding nylon aerogels that integrate a high specific surface area (226&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), exceptional compressive modulus (12.6&#160;MPa), and ultralow thermal conductivity (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Preventing Glioblastoma Relapse by Igniting Innate Immunity through Mitochondrial Stress in the Surgical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a charge&#8208;inversion nanodrug (INSTNA) that can activate innate immunity by interfering with the mitochondrial electron transport chain of tumor cells in the surgical cavity of GBM. Mechanistically, INSTNA coordinated tumor treatment fields (TTF) induce mitochondrial stress and release damage&#8208;related molecular patterns (DAMP) that amplify innate immunity and further activate adaptive immunity to kill GBM cells.








Abstract
Innate immunity is crucial in orchestrating the brain immune response, however, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade innate immune surveillance, posing significant challenges for current immunotherapies. Here, a therapeutic strategy is reported that aims at reactivating innate immune responses in GBM via targeted induction of mitochondrial stress, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity. Specifically, innate immune&#8208;stimulating nanoparticles (INSTNA) are developed, encapsulating positively charged iridium&#8208;based complexes (Ir&#8208;mito) and small interfering RNA against Methylation&#8208;Controlled J protein (si&#8208;MCJ) to attenuate mitochondrial respiration. This combination effectively disrupts mitochondrial function of GBM cells, particularly when combined with tumor&#8208;treating fields. The engineered charge&#8208;reversal INSTNA impair the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), inducing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) stress and subsequent mitochondrial matrix release. Furthermore, hydrogel&#8208;mediated delivery of INSTNA in a postoperative GBM mouse model significantly remodeled the immunosuppressive microenvironment, resulting in pronounced tumor regression. In sum, these findings highlight that targeted induction of mitochondrial stress in postoperative GBM can potentiate innate immune activation and enhance adaptive immunity, offering a promising avenue for mitigating GBM recurrence.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tunable Fluorinated Polyester Electrolytes with Enhanced Interfacial Stability for Recyclable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated polyesters are shown to regulate lithium&#8208;ion coordination and promote stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The rational structural design enables uniform lithium deposition, suppressed dendrite growth, and enhanced cycling performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. This work highlights the importance of molecular engineering in developing high&#8208;performance and sustainable electrolytes.








Abstract
Polyesters, with their tunable chemical structures and environmental sustainability, have drawn growing attention as solid polymer electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Through a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study involving the systematic variation of carbon chain lengths in the flexible (diol) and coordinating (diacid) segments, along with selective fluorination at distinct positions along the polymer backbone, 18 types of polyester are fabricated and demonstrate that fluorination at the coordinating segment significantly enhances ionic conductivity by suppressing crystallinity. In contrast, fluorination at the flexible segment reduces ionic migration barriers by providing more homogeneous coordinating sites, thereby improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number, despite increasing chain rigidity and a reduction in overall ionic conductivity. The optimized fluorinated polyesters exhibit excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal by facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as supported by experimental and theoretical simulation analysis. More importantly, to enhance cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability, a solvent&#8208;based recycling route has been developed, achieving substantial recovery yields and notable environmental benefits. This work provides a versatile molecular design and closed&#8208;loop recovery strategy for fluorinated polyester electrolytes, advancing their practical application in high&#8208;energy and sustainable SSLMBs.

         <title>Gbits/s&#8208;Level Encrypted Spectral Wireless Communication Enabled by High&#8208;Performance Flexible Organic Hyperspectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;novel spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology based on an organic hyperspectrometer is proposed. By analyzing the spectrum of information&#8208;carrying light in the time domain, binary information encoded in different wavelengths can be extracted. The theoretical communication rate reaches up to 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, representing the highest value reported to date for wireless optical communication based on organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The exponential growth of data in the information era has pushed conventional optical communication technology to its limitations, including inefficient spectral utilization, slow data rate, and inherent security vulnerabilities. Here, a transformative high&#8208;speed organic spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology enabled by a flexible, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance organic hyperspectrometer is proposed that integrates ultrahigh&#8208;speed data transmission with hardware&#8208;level encryption. By synergistically combining organic photodetector arrays with tunable responsivities and spectral&#8208;tunable organic filters, the organic hyperspectrometer achieves a broad spectral detection range of 400 to 900 nm, resolution of 1.08 nm, accuracy of 0.60 nm, and response time of 684 ns. Unlike prior optical wireless communication systems, the organic hyperspectrometer&#8208;based SWC platform uniquely decodes high&#8208;speed encrypted data at the hardware level, which is a breakthrough in secure, high&#8208;speed, and high&#8208;capacity communication. Harnessing the full visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectrum, the SWC system achieves a theoretical data rate of 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, ranking as the highest&#8208;speed organic optical communication system. Furthermore, the intrinsic flexibility and bandgap&#8208;tunability of organic materials enable unparalleled portability, adaptability, and scalability of organic SWC, establishing a scalable framework for terahertz&#8208;scale data transmission. These advancements mark a pivotal leap toward secure, high&#8208;speed, and ultracompact optical networks for the future data&#8208; and AI&#8208;driven era.

         <title>Observation of &#957; = 5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in Trilayer Graphene Proximitized by V&#8208;Doped WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even&#8208;denominator 5/2 fractional state in trilayer graphene/V&#8208;doped WSe2 heterostructure, mediated by proximitized magnetism, is demonstrated. An exceptionally high energy gap &#8710;5/2 (48 K) for the 5/2 state, significantly surpassing previous values in semiconductors and bilayer graphene (&#8710;5/2 &lt; 1 K) is reported. The large &#8710;5/2 is essential for probing the non&#8208;Abelian nature of the 5/2 state and has implications for fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation.








Abstract
Graphene has long been a test bed for observing strongly correlated phenomena owing to its 2D nature and ability to host high carrier mobility. However, the lack of intrinsic magnetism and weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling limits its ability to host strong electronic correlations. Here, observation of strongly correlated phenomena in trilayer graphene (TLG) proximitized by a ferromagnetic V&#8208;doped WSe2 (V&#8208;WSe2) overlayer is reported. These include the emergence of an odd&#8208; and even&#8208;denominator fractional quantum Hall state at &#957;&#8197; = 5/2 and reentrant integer quantum Hall effect in the hole regime of the TLG, driven by proximate magnetism from the V&#8208;WSe2. A remarkably large activation energy gap (&#916;5/2 = 48 &#177; 5 K) for the 5/2 fractional state is observed, which is essential for probing its non&#8208;Abelian nature. Furthermore, the large &#916;5/2&#8197;significantly enhances its feasibility for topological quantum computation by exponentially suppressing the error rates. Additionally, the formation of three additional Dirac cones, termed Dirac &#8220;gullies,&#8221; is observed, which manifest as threefold&#8208;degenerate Landau levels in magnetotransport measurements. These findings not only advance the role of magnetism in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures but also open pathways toward studying non&#8208;Abelian quasiparticles for their exotic fundamental and technological implications.

An exceptionally high energy gap &#8710;&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; (48 K) for the 5/2 state, significantly surpassing previous values in semiconductors and bilayer graphene (&#8710;&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 K) is reported. The large &#8710;&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; is essential for probing the non-Abelian nature of the 5/2 state and has implications for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene has long been a test bed for observing strongly correlated phenomena owing to its 2D nature and ability to host high carrier mobility. However, the lack of intrinsic magnetism and weak spin-orbit coupling limits its ability to host strong electronic correlations. Here, observation of strongly correlated phenomena in trilayer graphene (TLG) proximitized by a ferromagnetic V-doped WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (V-WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) overlayer is reported. These include the emergence of an odd- and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#957;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8197; = 5/2 and reentrant integer quantum Hall effect in the hole regime of the TLG, driven by proximate magnetism from the V-WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A remarkably large activation energy gap (&lt;b&gt;&#916;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 48 &#177; 5 K) for the 5/2 fractional state is observed, which is essential for probing its non-Abelian nature. Furthermore, the large &lt;b&gt;&#916;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;significantly enhances its feasibility for topological quantum computation by exponentially suppressing the error rates. Additionally, the formation of three additional Dirac cones, termed Dirac &#8220;gullies,&#8221; is observed, which manifest as threefold-degenerate Landau levels in magnetotransport measurements. These findings not only advance the role of magnetism in graphene-based heterostructures but also open pathways toward studying non-Abelian quasiparticles for their exotic fundamental and technological implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergence of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pair Arrays in Multiferroic Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable 4.5&#160;nm&#8208;period polar vortex&#8211;antivortex arrays are realized in multiferroic/dielectric (BiFeO3/DyScO3) superlattices, which retain structural integrity above 350&#160;&#176;C, exhibit electrical switching, and display periodicity tunable via atomic&#8208;scale layer thickness control&#8212;offering a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power topological memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric topologies, renowned for their nanoscale dimensions and external electric field tunability, are emerging as leading candidates for high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory devices in the Big Data era. While polar configurations such as vortices, flux&#8208;closure domains, center&#8208;type domains, skyrmions, and merons have been extensively explored, antivortices remain largely underdeveloped. In this work, the discovery and realization of stable polar vortex&#8208;antivortex pair arrays within multiferroic&#8208;dielectric superlattices are reported with integrated experimental and theoretical efforts, enabled by low&#8208;symmetry BiFeO3 with diagonal spontaneous polarization. By employing atomic&#8208;level engineering to precisely modulate the architecture of BiFeO3 layers, achieving unprecedented periodicities as small as 4.5&#160;nm. These arrays exhibit exceptional thermal stability, preserving their structural integrity above room temperature, and reversible polarization switching under applied electric fields. Additionally, the sensitivity of domain wall configurations to the dielectric layer thickness offers further tunability. These findings not only expand the scope of ferroelectric topologies but also provide a versatile platform for harnessing antivortices in practical applications, paving the way for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory technologies.

         <title>Universal Method for Covalent Attachment of Hydrogels to Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy is presented for covalently attaching hydrogels to diverse polymeric substrates through reactive oxygen species. The scalable, linker&#8208;free approach enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing the fabrication of hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels, renowned for their biocompatibility and capacity to mimic biological tissues, are integral to many biomedical applications, such as implantable devices and wound dressings. However, their poor mechanical strength and the challenge of achieving durable adhesion to polymeric surfaces have hindered their broader utility. Current methods of creating hybrid solid&#8208;hydrogel (HSH) structures often rely on complex chemical linkers, adding steps, cytotoxic risks, and scalability issues. Here, a novel, reagent&#8208;free method that covalently bonds hydrogels to polymeric substrates directly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is introduced. Through an evaporation&#8208;induced enhanced concentration (EIEC) approach, robust hydrogel layers are formed on ROS&#8208;functionalized surfaces, eliminating the need for silane&#8208;based linkers and achieving up to 60&#160;kPa adhesion strength in wet conditions. This strategy offers robust hydrogel adhesion, reduces processing complexity, and preserves cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages with minimal immune response. Applicable across various hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chitosan, and polymeric substrates, including Teflon, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone (PCL), this dry process holds substantial promise for integration into advanced biomanufacturing systems, such as 3D bioprinters, unlocking new potentials in tissue engineering and biomedical device fabrication.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Adaptive Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Molecules via B&#8592;N Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamically tunable butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular system based on B&#8592;N coordination enables force&#8208;driven transitions between bistable stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements reveal distinct charge transport mechanisms, which are modulated by external electric fields, substituent effects, and quantum interference effects. These findings highlight the potential of B&#8592;N interactions in designing multiunit functional molecular junctions with tailored electronic characteristics.








Abstract
Achieving dynamic control over stereostructures and electronic properties of rigid molecules remains a significant challenge due to the delicate balance between stability and flexibility. Here, the construction of butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular junctions stabilized by moderate&#8208;strength boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) coordination between boraacenes and pyridines is reported. By leveraging the pivot&#8208;like flexibility of B&#8592;N bonds, molecular conductance switching with on/off ratios exceeding 100 is achieved through force&#8208;driven dynamic transitions between distinct stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements combined with first&#8208;principle calculations identify distinct charge transport mechanisms&#8212;through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond&#8212;associated with the butterfly&#8208;wing open and closed configurations. Furthermore, external factors like electric fields and substituent effects modulate &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and charge transport properties. The introduction of destructive quantum interference effects can be achieved by replacing molecular units. The findings demonstrate that B&#8592;N coordination serves as a dynamically tunable linkage, offering a pathway to design molecular platforms with multifunctional units, customized stereo&#8208;conformations, and quantum effects.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Micromotors in Air Propelled by Thermal Convection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;driven micromotors in air can overcome gravity and generate convective motion by a light&#8208;induced thermal mechanism driven by a temperature gradient in the air caused by the interaction of the gold nanoparticles present on the surface of ZnO and NIR irradiation. NaGdF4:Er, Yb upconverting nanoparticles enable temperature quantification on the micromotors' surface through luminescence nanothermometry. Tracking of motion and speed quantification is achieved with a microscope camera, light scattering and software tracking. Schematic created using BioRender.








Abstract
Micromotors are an attractive cutting&#8208;edge technology that exhibit controllable motion in response to chemical reactions or external stimuli. These nature&#8208;inspired materials are widely explored for use in environmental remediation, and drug delivery, other emerging applications. Until now, the micromotors field is restricted to applications in aqueous environments, as achieving controllable motion in air while overcoming gravity remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, to our knowledge, we introduce a system capable of overcoming gravity to achieve light&#8208;induced thermal convective motion in air, driven by near&#8208;infrared light excitation. The micromotors are composed of spiky, pollen&#8208;like ZnO microparticles coated with gold nanoparticles, which interact photothermally with the NIR light, generating a thermal gradient that induces propulsion of the micromotor system. Lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles are deposited onto the micromotor surface to enable nanothermometric monitoring of surface temperature, providing critical information needed to describe the system's thermal behavior in air. This micromotor platform provides a versatile approach to overcome gravity and induce a controllable movement in a gaseous matrix, opening new opportunities to develop proof&#8208;of&#8208;concepts and applications using this aerodynamic micromotor approach.

         <title>Phase Stabilization of In2Se3 by Disordered Ni Intercalation and its Enhanced Thermoelectrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that disordered Ni intercalation in In2Se3 stabilizes the phase structure, enhances electrical conductivity, and reduces thermal conductivity. This strategy improves the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) at 500&#160;&#176;C, providing new insights for optimizing layered thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0&#8211;0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, is synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as &#8220;anchor points&#8221; within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500&#160;&#176;C. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.

         <title>Anisotropic Optoelectronic Synapses in 2D Nb2GeTe4 for Direction&#8208;Programmable Neuromorphic Perception and Decision&#8208;Making</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck. Using anisotropic 2D Nb2GeTe4, dual electronic&#8208;optical synapses with directional plasticity are developed: 98.3% accuracy along a&#8208;axis vs 88.3% along b&#8208;axis under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation. This enables compact neuromorphic hardware with co&#8208;stimulation processing, demonstrated in high&#8208;accuracy machine vision (89.6%) and vehicle navigation (90.2%). It advances multimodal sensing for edge AI and robotics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing presents a promising solution for the von Neumann bottleneck, enabling energy&#8208;efficient and intelligent sensing platforms. Although 2D materials are ideal for bioinspired neuromorphic devices, achieving multifunctional synaptic operations with simple configurations and linear weight updates remains challenging. Inspired by biological axons, the in&#8208;plane anisotropy of 2D Nb2GeTe4 is exploited to develop dual electronic&#8208;optical synaptic devices. The device exhibits anisotropic hole mobilities (137.97 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the a&#8208;axis and 78.29 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the b&#8208;axis) and a wavelength&#8208;dependent photoresponse. This enables directional synaptic plasticity under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation, achieving 98.3% accuracy along the a&#8208;axis and 88.3% along the b&#8208;axis in adaptive image processing. A machine vision system with 89.6% object recognition accuracy and an intelligent vehicle navigation platform with 90.2% decision&#8208;making accuracy is also demonstrated. The integration of anisotropic transport and spectrally tunable responses in a single material paves the way for compact neuromorphic hardware with multimodal sensing and parallel processing capabilities. This study advances 2D material&#8208;based neuroelectronics for edge computing, autonomous robotics, and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Niobium Oxide Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters Boosting Charge Transfer for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly unsaturated, sub&#8208;nanoscale niobium&#8208;oxide clusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon feature self&#8208;adaptive Nb4+/Nb5+ redox pairs that dynamically mediate polysulfide conversion in ether&#8208;based, room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A distinct d&#8208;band center self&#8208;regulation mechanism simultaneously accelerates the sulfur&#8208;reduction and sulfur&#8208;oxidation half&#8208;reactions, sustaining high capacity with an ultra&#8208;low capacity&#8208;fade rate over 3000 cycles.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage system, yet hindered by the unregulated sulfur redox pathway, severe polysulfide shuttling and rapid capacity fading. Herein, highly unsaturated niobium&#8208;oxide sub&#8208;nanoclusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon black (NbOx&#8208;DCB) as a dynamic sulfur&#8208;conversion catalyst are introduced. The delocalized Nb d&#8208;electrons in the sub&#8208;nanocluster configuration create a mixed Nb4+/Nb5+ valence state that functions as a bidirectional electron reservoir, thereby enabling a distinct d&#8208;band&#8208;center self&#8208;regulation mechanism. The strong d&#8211;p orbital coupling enabled by a Nb4+&#8208;rich surface effectively captures sodium polysulfides and accelerates sulfur conversion kinetics during discharge, while a Nb5+&#8208;rich surface promotes facile solid&#8208;polysulfide decomposition during charging. Consequently, the NbOx&#8208;DCB/S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 1184&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles and retains 547&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to a decay rate of 0.0027% per cycle. The general applicability&#160;of this approach is validated by high&#8208;performance tungsten and vanadium oxide sub&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. These findings highlight sub&#8208;nanoscale metal&#8208;oxide engineering as a versatile route to high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Competing Grain Growth Pathways in Anisotropic Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ microscopy and simulations, this study unravels competing grain growth pathways in Bi2Te3&#8208;based nanoplates. It is found that pure Bi2Te3 nanoplates undergo predominantly surface&#8208;driven reshaping, while Sb&#8208;doping alters interfacial chemistry to promote collective grain merging. This work demonstrates how grain boundary modification can rationally steer microstructural evolution for advanced thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric nanoplates derived from anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials such as Bi2Te3 are pivotal for flexible electronics and microscale thermal management. Their performance critically depends on grain boundary (GB) microstructure, but the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing grain growth in these highly anisotropic systems remain elusive. This particularly concerns the competition between individual nanoplate reshaping driven by facet stabilization and collective merging at GBs. Integrating in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these competing pathways in pure Bi2Te3 (BT) and Sb&#8208;doped (BST) systems are unraveled. Undoped BT nanoplates preferentially undergo atomically localized reshaping, with atoms migrating from high&#8208;energy edges to stabilize low&#8208;energy facets. Conversely, Sb doping introduces Sb&#8208;Te interfacial phases that thermodynamically favor GB coalescence, thereby shifting the dominant pathway to collective merging. This work reveals how chemical modification steers GB evolution, determining whether reshaping or merging predominates. Such understanding is crucial for rationally designing anisotropic layered materials for applications in flexible electronics, topological materials, and energy&#8208;efficient devices.

This work demonstrates how grain boundary modification can rationally steer microstructural evolution for advanced thermoelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric nanoplates derived from anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials such as Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are pivotal for flexible electronics and microscale thermal management. Their performance critically depends on grain boundary (GB) microstructure, but the atomic-scale mechanisms governing grain growth in these highly anisotropic systems remain elusive. This particularly concerns the competition between individual nanoplate reshaping driven by facet stabilization and collective merging at GBs. Integrating in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these competing pathways in pure Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BT) and Sb-doped (BST) systems are unraveled. Undoped BT nanoplates preferentially undergo atomically localized reshaping, with atoms migrating from high-energy edges to stabilize low-energy facets. Conversely, Sb doping introduces Sb-Te interfacial phases that thermodynamically favor GB coalescence, thereby shifting the dominant pathway to collective merging. This work reveals how chemical modification steers GB evolution, determining whether reshaping or merging predominates. Such understanding is crucial for rationally designing anisotropic layered materials for applications in flexible electronics, topological materials, and energy-efficient devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orderly Drawing Photo&#8208;Thermal Synergistic Electron Flow for Efficient CO2 Reduction under Natural Sunlight</title>

         <dc:description>
A stable Z&#8208;scheme FexInySz/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates 1.16&#160;% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency for CO2 reduction under natural sunlight for four consecutive days, as photothermal synergy stretches electrons from O to Fe and optimizes active sites.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green promising approach for CO2 reduction. Metal sulfides are widely studied in this field due to the high&#8208;efficiency, however, most of them are prone to photo&#8208;corrosion. Herein, a stable and efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction catalyst is reported, FexInySz/TiO2 owing an orderly drawing photo&#8208;thermal synergistic electron flow for CO2 reduction in a field experiment. The tests under natural sunlight conditions demonstrated that FexInySz/TiO2 has a stability of 4 natural days. The maximum photothermal energy conversion efficiency is 1.16%, which is the highest record under concentrated natural sunlight for CO2 reduction with pure water. The in situ rapid&#8208;scan XANES and XPS show the raising temperature and photo&#8208;irradiation synergistically stretch electrons from O to Fe, revealing the mechanism of thermal modulation to optimize the active sites for efficient and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work pioneers the stable and efficient reduction of CO2 under outdoor sunlight conditions, providing a theoretical foundation for the outdoor application of this technology.

         <title>Pure&#8208;Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers with Discontinuous Fused Benzene Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) molecular engineering composed of discontinuous fused benzene rings is proposed, and obtains a pair of green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz. (P) and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based electroluminescence devices deliver pure&#8208;green emission peaking at 516&#160;nm, with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 37.3%/36.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Helicene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials suffer from severely low color purity in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a novel molecular engineering strategy is introduced by replacing helicene containing continuous fused benzene rings with a multiple resonance (MR) framework comprising discontinuous fused benzene rings. This approach effectively suppresses high&#8208;frequency C&#9472;C bond stretching vibrations and enhances short&#8208;range charge transfer, enabling high color purity, CPL activity, and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz display bright and narrowband green emission peaking at 512&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Notably, the enantiomers (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz exhibit narrowband CPL spectra with FWHMs of 26 and 25&#160;nm, the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.72) and (0.15, 0.72), and photoluminescence dissymmetry factors of +2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs deliver pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by a peak wavelength of 516&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 27&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), representing the purest green CP&#8208;OLEDs reported to date. Furthermore, these devices exhibit high electroluminescence dissymmetry factors of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, and maximum external quantum efficiencies of 37.3% and 36.6%, respectively.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room&#8208;Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field observation of stable skyrmion&#8211;hopfion spin textures in EuS&#9472;Bi2Se3&#9472;EuS trilayers is reported. Combining Lorentz TEM imaging and micromagnetic modeling, the authors unveil how interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and geometric confinement stabilize these multidimensional topological states. These findings offer a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power spintronic devices harnessing robust, chiral magnetism in engineered topological heterostructures.








Abstract
Topological spin configurations, such as soliton&#8208;like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have recently emerged in fundamental science and technology. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room temperature is crucial for their use as long&#8208;range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation are hindered by multi&#8208;step field training and competing interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multidimensional topological spin textures is desirable, with skyrmions forming swirling, hedgehog&#8208;like spin structures in two dimensions and hopfions as their twisted 3D counterparts. Here, the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field is reported, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion&#8208;hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modeling, the experimental observations of hopfion&#8208;skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. This model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction. This study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetic topological carriers, paving the way for ultralow&#8208;power and high&#8208;density information processing.

The self&#8208;propulsive nanomotors enable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided microemboli diagnosis and real&#8208;time thrombolysis monitoring at millimeter&#8208;scale resolution. Based on the active penetration&#8208;promoted thermoablation and chemical lysis, these nanomotors achieve efficient, rapid, safe thrombolysis in both posterior auricular artery thrombosis and submillimeter&#8208;sized microemboli&#8208;induced pulmonary embolism models.








Abstract
Pulmonary embolism (PE), a life&#8208;threatening condition caused by thromboembolic obstruction of pulmonary arteries, demands urgent therapeutic interventions and precise diagnostic strategies to prevent systemic complications. Current thrombolytic therapies and imaging modalities face critical limitations, including hemorrhagic risks from high&#8208;dose fibrinolytic drugs and insufficient sensitivity for detecting microemboli or dynamically tracking thrombolytic progression. Herein, a self&#8208;propelling nanomotor platform is reported that integrates second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided navigation, thrombus&#8208;targeting capability, and synergistic thrombolysis for real&#8208;time theranostics management of PE. Leveraging a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield (1.08%) for NIR&#8208;II probes and prolonged circulation half&#8208;life (7.2 h), these nanomotors enable sensitive detection of submillimeter microemboli and sustained, millimeter&#8208;level precision monitoring of thrombolytic progression. Through a self&#8208;penetration&#8208;enhanced synergistic therapy&#8208; combining thermal ablation and chemical lysis, the platform achieved rapid vascular recanalization, exceeding 95% efficiency within a shortened therapeutic timeframe, using only 13.6% of the clinical urokinase (UK) dose. Validation in both the posterior auricular artery thrombosis (PAAT) and submillimeter microemboli&#8208;induced PE models demonstrated accelerated embolus clearance, precision thrombolytic monitoring, and excellent biosafety without secondary embolism or hemorrhagic complications. This work demonstrates the significant potential of multifunctional nanomotors for the precision management of thrombotic disorders.

         <title>Bifunctionally Driven Organic Photonic Conversion Devices Facilitated by Minimalistic Synthesis&#8208;Based Interfacial Energetic Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

A benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled monolayer (BPA) simultaneously optimizes hole extraction and noise suppression, enabling bifunctional organic photovoltaics&#8211;photodetectors that deliver superb indoor performance and commercial viability. BPA&#8208;devices achieve 28.6% PCE at 1000 lx, retain 93% efficiency on large&#8208;scaled devices, and reach 584 fW NEP with a 103 kHz 3dB bandwidth, while cutting production costs by 720%.








Abstract
Bifunctional integration of indoor organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) faces fundamental challenges because of incompatible interfacial thermodynamics: indoor OPVs require unimpeded charge extraction under low&#8208;light conditions (200&#8211;1000&#160;lx), whereas OPDs require stringent suppression of noise current. Conventional hole transport layers (HTLs) fail to satisfy these opposing charge&#8208;dynamic requirements concurrently with commercial practicality (large&#8208;area uniformity, photostability, and cost&#8208;effective manufacturability). This study introduces benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid (BPA)&#8212;a minimalist self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#8208;based HTL with a benzene core and phosphonic acid anchoring group&#8212;enabling cost&#8208;effective synthesis and excellent ITO interfacial properties such as energy alignment, uniform monolayer, and stability. This molecular design resolves core limitations and achieves high indoor OPV efficiency (28.6% PCE at 1000&#160;lx LED 2700 K), maintains 93% PCE retention when scaled by &#8776;220&#215; area, and delivers competitive self&#8208;powered (V = 0&#160;V) OPD performance (noise equivalent power = 584 fW at bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz and wavelength = 730&#160;nm; 3&#160;dB frequency = 103&#160;kHz). Simplified synthesis of BPA reduces production costs by 720% ($0.042 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 9&#215; higher power&#8208;per&#8208;cost ratio (19.25 mW&#8729;$&#8722;1) relative to its&#160;counterpart SAM. Synergy between performance and commercial practicality positions BPA&#8208;HTL as a transformative enabler for self&#8208;powered IoT and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Pyroelectric Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation: A Universal Strategy for Low&#8208;Temperature Gas Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in promoting heterogeneous catalytic reaction processes, but how to generate ROS continuously during the catalyst process remains a challenge. Here, the authors propose a pyroelectric&#8208;enhanced catalytic oxidation strategy to achieve efficient and continuous formation of ROS.








Abstract
In the field of gas phase catalysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role, but how to improve catalytic efficiency and lifetime by forming ROS efficiently and sustainably during the catalytic process is a challenge for high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, a pyroelectric enhanced catalytic oxidation (PECO) strategy is reported that can effectively enhance the catalytic oxidation efficiency and life of the catalyst by constantly generation of ROS. When gaseous pollutants of formaldehyde (HCHO) are catalytically degraded by conductive aerogel catalysts of MnOx, the HCHO to CO2 conversion efficiency is increased by &#8776;300% to 95.33% at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV: 600 L&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) using the pyroelectric effect of BaTiO3, and the efficiency attenuation is less than 3% during the continuous catalytic process of 1200&#160;h. The experimental and theoretical analysis confirm that the pyroelectric effect contributes to improving valence transition of Mn3+/Mn4+ and electron transfer of oxygen&#8208;containing molecules thus leading to the continuous formation of ROS. The PECO strategy provides a simple and effective approach for ROS engineering and has broad application prospects in the field of catalysis.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Engineered Protein Delivery via Integrated Covalent Coupling and Pathological Triggers for Precision Microenvironment Reprogramming in Tissue Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive biomaterial platform is developed for spatiotemporally controlled factor delivery in response to phase&#8208;specific enzymes (MMP2/thrombin). Using natural biomaterials (HA, SCECM, chitosan) and enzymatic conjugation (Sortase A), the system precisely delivers each protein in spinal cord and myocardial infarction models, this sequential release strategy significantly enhances tissue repair by optimizing the therapeutic window.








Abstract
Tissue injury presents a complex microenvironment with temporal pathological dynamics, necessitating precision therapeutic strategies. However, current interventions lack effective measures that precisely respond to and modulate the dynamic changes in the microenvironment. Herein, a biomaterial&#8208;driven platform based on covalent conjugation and enzyme&#8208;responsive release, enabling the spatiotemporally controlled delivery of regenerative and immunomodulatory factors, is developed. Following tissue injury, the early&#8208;phase protease thrombin and the delayed&#8208;phase matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP2) serve as endogenous triggers that correspond to distinct stages of the microenvironmental evolution. By site&#8208;specific covalent conjugation via Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated transpeptidation to intraluminal aligned fibers, combined with outer encapsulation within T&#8208;HA (thrombin&#8208;responsive cleavable hyaluronic acid gel), it is discovered that sequential delivery (CNTF/FGF2 followed by IL&#8208;4) significantly enhances spinal cord injury (SCI) recovery compared to reverse sequencing (IL&#8208;4 followed by CNTF/FGF2). Likewise, SrtA&#8208;mediated protein conjugation to HA demonstrates that FGF2 delivery preceding IL&#8208;4 resulted in superior cardiac functional restoration in the myocardial infarction (MI) model. This spatiotemporally system optimizes the critical therapeutic window for inflammation and tissue remodeling after injury, offering a versatile paradigm for addressing the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of injured tissues.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3DyI6:Er3+ perovskite achieves strong 1540 nm emission via synergistic dual energy transfer pathways (STE &#8594; Er3+ and Dy3+ &#8594; Er3+), enhanced by phonon&#8208;assisted processes. This mechanism enables high&#8208;performance NIR LEDs with record EQE and stability, promising for optical communication applications.








Abstract
Er3+&#8208;doped 1.54 &#181;m light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the optical communication C&#8208;band are central to the development of integrated photonic systems. Given the pressing need for efficient, stable, cost&#8208;effective, and low&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven 1.54 &#181;m light sources, a lanthanide&#8208;based metal halide Cs3DyI6:Er3+ nanocrystal is engineered with a tetragonal phase structure. The study reveals a unique dual&#8208;channel energy transfer mechanism. The 574 nm emission, stemming from 4F9/2&#8208;2H13/2 orbital transitions of Dy3+ ions, enables phonon&#8208;assistant energy transfer to excite 4I15/2&#8208; 4S3/2 of Er3+ ions. Meanwhile, self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) contribute additional energy via a 488 nm broadband emission to excite 4I15/2&#8208;4F7/2 of Er3+. The two pathways synergize to facilitate efficient 1.54 &#181;m emission from Er3+ ions, overcoming limitations of traditional single&#8208;path energy transfer systems. To optimize device performance, 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TPPO) is employed for passivating surface defects to enhance the overall photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87.4%. Precise control of the LiF interlayer thickness (1&#8211;2 nm) achieves balanced electron&#8211;hole injection, significantly improving both external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational stability. The fabricated infrared LED device demonstrates outstanding performance, with a record EQE of 2.76% at 1.54 &#181;m and a half&#8208;life of 345 min, marking a significant milestone in optical communication technology.

This work presents an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material that integrates ion&#8208;conducting pathways and redox&#8208;active centers via covalent bonding. The polymer not only exhibits appreciable Li&#8314; conductivity, but also delivers a high reversible capacity below 2.5 V, driven by a potential&#8208;gated electronic structure transformation. This multifunctionality enables a versatile solid&#8208;state battery with integrated design, flexibility, and high energy density.








Abstract
The development of practical solid&#8208;state batteries is hindered by their high interfacial resistance and sluggish diffusion properties, primarily due to the heterogeneous interfaces between the solid electrolyte and the electrode. Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material (P(EO2&#8208;S3)) is presented, which covalently integrates ethylene oxide groups for Li+ transport and trisulfide linkages for redox&#8208;active sites. This material exhibits favorable ionic conductivity as a solid electrolyte, while its reversible redox activity activates below 2.5&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, delivering a high reversible capacity of 491.7 mAh g&#8722;1. Leveraging P(EO2&#8208;S3) as both cathode and electrolyte, integrated cells (P(EO2&#8208;S3)@CP|P(EO2&#8208;S3)|Li) exhibit accelerated electrochemical kinetics while maintaining cycling stability in flexible devices over 20&#160;000 bending cycles. As a redox&#8208;active catholyte of LiFePO4, P(EO2&#8208;S3) increases the capacity of the composite cathode to 358.3 mAh g&#8722;1 based on LiFePO4 mass, achieving an electrode energy density of 585.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work establishes a new paradigm for multifunctional polymers that integrates ion transport and storage, offering a versatile platform for flexible, high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Adaptive Localized Ectopic Structure Enhances Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural repair is crucial for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. A lithium&#8208;rich, low&#8208;cobalt deep eutectic solvent repairs phase defects, induces ectopic sites, and facilitates adaptive reconstruction during annealing. This process generates adaptive localized ectopic structures, which form degradation barriers that control long&#8208;range disorder through the regulation of localized disorder.








Abstract
Direct regeneration has emerged as a budding strategy for recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet restoring the degraded crystal structure of the cathode remains a momentous handicap. Here, a novel deep eutectic solvent rich in lithium (Li) is developed that not only induces the formation of an adaptive local ectopic structure (ALES) characterized by disordered and localized cations, but also facilitates the separation of cathode sheets and replenishes depleted elements. Within ALES, ectopic cobalt (Co) sites boost Li+ diffusion by expanding the Li slab and forming octahedral coordination with low&#8208;spin Co3+, while ectopic Li modulates Co&#9472;O interactions, collaboratively impeding long&#8208;range structural disorder, mitigating lattice stress, and reducing charge density fluctuations. The synergistic interaction between the ectopic Co and Li enables in situ structural repair of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), thereby restoring crystallinity and enhancing electrochemical performance. The regenerated LCO delivers a reversible capacity of 183.08 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, with 87.01% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, outperforming commercial counterparts. This study offers a new pathway for addressing an urgent bottleneck in structure&#8208;targeted LIB regeneration.

         <title>Constructing 0D Bismuth&#8208;Metal Nanosphere Networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 Heteromorphic Junctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers and nanosheets. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate significantly surpasses traditional BWO.








Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalysis holds great potential for the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), yet photocatalysts often experience low efficiency due to insufficient surface catalytic active sites, limited light absorption, and poor carrier separation efficiency. Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers (NFs) and nanosheets (NSs). This establishes a synergistic mechanism of &#8220;surface active sites&#8208;intrinsic defects&#8208;carrier separation.&#8221; Initially, the electrospun BWO precursor NFs are calcined in air, resulting in 2D NSs growing radially along the NFs in an ordered, spaced arrangement to form 1D/2D BWO structures. Subsequently, under H2/Ar reduction, Bi3+ species are preferentially reduced to Bi&#8304; along the NF axes and NS corners, forming a dynamically evolved metal&#8208;defect regulatory system. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate is 3.5 times faster than that of 1D/2D BWO and significantly surpasses traditional BWO. This work presents a novel perspective for designing photocatalysts to efficiently remove VOCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Defect Passivation and Free&#8208;Volume Reduction by Fluorinated Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable simultaneous multi&#8208;defect passivation and interfacial free&#8208;volume reduction for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells, three hole&#8208;transport materials featuring distinct fluorine distribution are systematically designed and compared. Benefiting from better interfacial passivation ability, lower interfacial free&#8208;volume, more intimate interface contact, and enhanced suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation, AdF&#8208;BCz&#8208;based devices achieved a champion efficiency of 25.35% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Interfacial defects and free&#8208;volume between the perovskite layer and hole transport material (HTM) critically impact the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the interfacial issues of the PSCs are addressed by strategically modulating the fluorine distribution in N,N&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole (BCz)&#8208;based HTMs, specifically, fluorine is introduced either asymmetrically and symmetrically on the peripheral groups, yielding AdF&#8208;BCz and SdF&#8208;BCz, respectively. Through a combination of experimental characterization and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that AdF&#8208;BCz exhibits superior interfacial passivation stability against Pb2+ and I&#8211; related defects, as well as stronger adhesion to the perovskite surface compared to the fluorine&#8208;free NF&#8208;BCz and symmetrically substituted SdF&#8208;BCz. Moreover, AdF&#8208;BCz reduces interfacial free&#8208;volume, promotes more intimate contact at the interface, and enhances the suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation. Consequently, the PSCs fabricated with AdF&#8208;BCz achieved a notable efficiency of 25.35%, outperforming devices based on SdF&#8208;BCz (23.12%) and NF&#8208;BCz (24.2%). Furthermore, unencapsulated AdF&#8208;BCz based PSCs exhibit respectable stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiencies after 2000&#160;h under 30% relative humidity and 82% after 300&#160;h of continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Semitransparent Photovoltaics via Reflection Optical Paths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work devises a reflective semitransparent photovoltaic (R&#8208;STPV) structure, which exploits a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. By integrating a reflector that selectively reflects visible light, such a design enables a high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV with 14.4% efficiency and 92.2% visible light transmittance, setting a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% among STPVs.








Abstract
Semitransparent photovoltaics (STPV) show great potential for building integration, but the imbalance between visible light transmission and power generation limits their practical applications. To overcome this, a reflective STPV (R&#8208;STPV) structure is proposed, via utilizing a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. Unlike STPV systems relying on transmission optical paths, this design bypasses reflection losses and alleviates the stringent selective absorption requirements for the active layer. Thus, such design enables the fabrication of wavelength&#8208;selective STPVs using various high&#8208;performance photovoltaic materials such as silicon, CIGS, and CdTe. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical reflector is designed to selectively reflect visible light and transmit the invisible one, and by integrating it with the above PVs, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance R&#8208;STPV with appropriate optical geometry. Remarkably, the best Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV delivers a reliable efficiency of 14.4%, an average visible light transmittance of 92.2%, a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% and an exceptional color rendering index of 99%. The versatility of R&#8208;STPV window technology makes it suitable for various building&#8208;integration application scenarios, and an average annual power generation of 69.8&#160;kWh&#160;year&#160;m&#8722;2 is obtained according to the simulation results. Therefore, this work paves a new path for high&#8208;performance solar windows that will contribute significantly to energy sustainability.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into Nanoparticle Exsolution at Dislocations in Dislocation&#8208;Engineered Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals an atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and the exsolution of surface nanoparticles through a novel approach for dislocation engineering in epitaxial thin films. Employing in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions induced by the dislocation structure.








Abstract
Achieving control over properties such as density and lateral distribution of catalytic nanoparticles under operation conditions is a major challenge for the development of active and durable catalysts, where nanoparticle coarsening is often the cause of performance degradation. While metal exsolution catalysts are regarded to be robust against this degradation mode, coarsening and increased concentrations of exsolved metal nanoparticles have been detected near extended defects. The present study examines the role of dislocations in metal exsolution reactions and explores the potential of dislocation&#8208;engineering for the synthesis of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles. An atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and surface nanoparticle locations is demonstrated through a novel approach for engineering epitaxial thin films with confined regions of increased dislocation densities in combination with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. While nanoparticle exsolution proceeds across the entire sample, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions that are likely to lower the energy barrier for nanoparticle nucleation. This work establishes a proof of concept for using engineered dislocations in exsolution catalysts to synthesize nanoparticles with modified nanoparticle&#8208;support properties relevant for the thermal stability and the lateral distribution of exsolved nanoparticles.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Strain Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence for Potential Nondestructive Artificial Joint Stress Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time stress sensing during total knee replacement procedure is expected to be realized based on near&#8208;infrared mechanoluminescent phosphor of Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99, which has the lowest strain sensitivity as low as 50&#160;&#181;st. 








Abstract
Recently, joint replacement surgery is facing significant challenges of patient dissatisfaction and the need for revision procedures. In&#8208;situ monitoring of stress stability at the site of artificial joint replacement during postoperative evaluation is important. Mechanoluminescence (ML), a novel &#8220;force to light&#8221; conversion technology, may be used to monitor such bio&#8208;stress within tissues. However, this is hindered by ultraviolet&#8211;visible ML emission wavelength, low ML intensity, and high strain response sensitivity. Here, by incorporating Sb3+ ions into Sr3Sn2O7 crystals, a highly strain&#8208;responsive&#160;material, with ML originating from intrinsic defect emissions is obtained. The Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99 film produces detectable ML signals under compressive strain as low as 50&#160;&#181;st in the absence of biological tissue. After pre&#8208;irradiating with red light through 15&#160;mm of porcine tissue, ML signals can still be detected through the same tissue thickness. Notably, this material enabled real&#8208;time stress imaging through 4&#160;mm of porcine skin during mild finger joint bending. This work presents a novel methodological framework and proposes a new mechanism to defect ML. It offers a fresh perspective for designing high&#8208;performance ML materials and lays the foundation for innovative research to enhance the functionality of artificial tissues and joints in living organism.

By simply tuning temporal dynamics electrically, the system achieves 93.7% accuracy for MNIST handwritten digits, 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 images, and 81.8% for chest X&#8208;rays, surpassing CNNs in efficiency. Combining strong performance and flexibility, UFLEX TFTs enable neuromorphic hardware for next&#8208;generation wearable edge devices.








Abstract
Reservoir computing (RC), a brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic algorithm, offers simplicity and efficiency for processing spatiotemporal signals. However, conventional RC systems face limitations in handling diverse temporal scales and spatial complexities due to invariant temporal dynamics. This study introduces a temporally reconfigurable RC system utilizing ultrathin, flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;gated thin&#8208;film transistors (UFLEX TFTs) with high performance: an on/off ratio of &#8776;107, endurance beyond 2.5 &#215; 104 pulses, and low variability. UFLEX TFTs, based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channels and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid AlOx dielectrics, enable modulation of temporal dynamics via simple electrical signals. The system maintains mechanical flexibility and robust performance after bending tests. By extracting features across varied temporal and spatial scales, it achieves classification accuracies of 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 object images and 81.8% for NIH chest X&#8208;ray images. This work lays a foundation for flexible neuromorphic hardware systems capable of efficient, high&#8208;performance spatiotemporal signal processing.

A self&#8208;assembled vanadium hydrogel integrates multienzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal THPS via one&#8208;step nanoconstruction. This TME&#8208;responsive platform combines catalytic tumor suppression, infection prevention, and dynamic mechanoadaptivity to surgical niches. By reprogramming immunosuppressive microenvironments via M1 macrophage polarization and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell recruitment, the hydrogel pioneers a paradigm for precision postsurgical therapy through synergistic immunomodulation and localized intervention.








Abstract
Surgical resection remains the frontline intervention for cancer; however, postoperative tumor recurrence and wound infection remain critical unmet challenge in surgical oncology. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanowired hydrogel (V&#8208;Hydrogel) is developed through a facile one&#8208;step assembly employing enzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal crosslinker THPS. The V&#8208;Hydrogel reserves the glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimetic enzymatic activities derived from vanadium oxide nanowires, thereby exhibiting efficient tumor&#8208;specific catalytic therapy. Simultaneously, the introduction of bactericide THPS endows the potent antibacterial capabilities of V&#8208;Hydrogel against surgical site infections. This hydrogel exhibits dynamic mechanical adaptability to the tumor microenvironment (f), ensuring conformal coverage of irregular resection cavities for precise therapy. Additionally, the V&#8208;Hydrogel can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME via polarizing macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotypes and recruiting cytotoxic T cells, thereby establishing systemic antitumor immunity. This multifunctional vanadium&#8208;integrated hydrogel platform, designed based on the pathological characteristics of postoperative tumors, addresses key limitations in conventional postoperative therapies, offering a strategy for postoperative adjuvant tumor therapy.

         <title>Regenerable Water Remediation Platform for Ultrafast Capture and Mineralization of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are effectively captured and mineralized by nitrate&#8208;intercalated copper&#8211;aluminum layered double hydroxides (CuAl LDH). The capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling process achieves ultrafast PFAS removal and regenerable water remediation. Regenerability is enabled by the memory effect of LDH, restoring the layered structure after thermal treatment and allowing repeated adsorption&#8208;destruction cycles with maintained performance.








Abstract
Concerns about per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) arise from their persistence, toxicity, and widespread presence in aquatic environments. Currently, activated carbon and ion exchange resins have been used to remove perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the most commonly studied PFAS, but these methods face challenges like low adsorption capacity and slow kinetics, leading to secondary waste issues. Here, it is observed that a high interlayer crystallinity of nitrate intercalated CuxAl layered double hydroxides (LDH) (CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH) enables a boundary&#8208;breaking performance of maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of PFOA as 1702&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at neutral pH and room temperature. The Al&#8208;Al clash within the cationic layers (basal plane disorder) enhances adsorption kinetics (k1 = 13.2 h&#8722;1), as determined by a 2H magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, PFOA&#8208;saturated Cu2Al&#8208;NO3 LDH can be regenerated through its memory effect, achieving &#8776;54% defluorination of the adsorbed PFOA in the presence of CaCO3 after the thermal treatment at 773 K (500&#160;&#176;C). Performance in continuous fixed&#8208;bed systems (720&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) and PFOA&#8208;spiked real water matrices indicates the practical application potential of CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH, suggesting an effective integrated ultrafast capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling (CTR) process for treating PFAS&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>Lanthanum&#8208;Induced Gradient Fields in Asymmetric Heterointerface Catalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled atomic migration during the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts often leads to disordered coordination environments, active site loss, and poor oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Herein, a La&#8208;mediated atomic migration strategy enables the fabrication of a well&#8208;defined asymmetric heterostructure (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC) featuring a built&#8208;in electric field. This architecture stabilizes the Fe active sites, enhances interfacial charge transport, and delivers an outstanding oxygen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts display considerable potential as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals in oxygen electrocatalysis. However, uncontrolled atomic migration and random structural rearrangement during pyrolysis often lead to disordered coordination environments and sparse active sites, fundamentally limiting their intrinsic catalytic activities and long&#8208;term durability. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for use in directionally regulating atomic migration pathways via the incorporation of a foreign metal (La). By exploiting the differences in the atomic migration priorities via the Kirkendall effect, directional control of atomic diffusion is achieved to fabricate a well&#8208;defined asymmetric multiphase heterointerface catalyst (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC). The presence of high&#8208;density, structurally well&#8208;defined active sites &#8211; along with a built&#8208;in directional electric field across the heterointerface &#8211; substantially enhances the efficiency of interfacial charge transport, thus improving the intrinsic activity and stability in oxygen electrocatalysis. When incorporated into a rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC delivers a high power density of 211 mW cm&#8722;2, with an exceptional cycling stability of &gt;240 h. This study establishes a generalizable atomic&#8208;level design strategy for use in engineering robust heterointerface catalysts and offers valuable insights for application in advancing next&#8208;generation renewable energy conversion and storage systems.

An innovative, scalable method fabricates transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles by blending mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) transparent styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with polyethylene, then selectively dissolving SEBS to create pores. The textile achieves 95% solar reflectivity, 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance, and sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 4&#176;C. This process reduces production costs by 68% and CO2 emissions by 92% versus conventional methods.








Abstract
Transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles represent a vital strategy for personal thermal management. However, traditional preparation methods based on heat&#8208;induced phase separation face significant challenges regarding cost, environmental impact, and optical performance. Herein, a novel preparation method is devloped by blending mid&#8208;IR transparent solid styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with solid polyethylene (PE), enabling the creation of pores through dissolving SEBS. Consequently, large&#8208;scale production of transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling films at the meter scale are achieved, exhibiting 95% solar reflectivity and 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance. Moreover, this method reduces costs by 68% and diminishes CO2 emissions by 92%. Under sunny and cloudy conditions (solar irradiance &#8776;730 and 280&#160;Wm&#8722;2, respectively), the film&#8208;covered simulated skin demonstrates sub&#8208;ambient cooling effects of &#8776;4 and 3&#160;&#176;C. Given its exceptional passive cooling capabilities, low&#8208;cost, and scalability, this film holds great potential for industrial and personal applications.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Degraded LiFePO4 Cathode Material via Natural Electron Donors Healing and Targeted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent cathode materials is crucial for the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. However, owing to the lack of targeted surface repair strategies, the regenerated LiFePO4 (LFP) always faces some issues, such as Fe ions re&#8208;migration and sluggish Li+ diffusion, or a serious trade&#8208;off between restored specific capacity and stability. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP. Theoretical calculations reveal that AP/LP patching coating forms a dual electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;conducting layer with the residual carbon layer, coupling with strengthened Fe&#9472;O bonding by Al doping, to improve kinetics and stability of LFP during cycling. The optimized regenerated LFP cathode exhibits a capacity of 124.3 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles at 2C with a capacity retention of 92.1%. This scalable healing and stabilizing strategy have large potential to strike a balance between specific capacity repairing and stability improvement in the regeneration process.

         <title>Localized Gradient Conductivity Enabled Ultrasensitive Flexible Tactile Sensors with Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design of localized gradient conductivity is presented, combining low&#8208;&#963; CPDMS (carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane) and high&#8208;&#963; AgNWs (silver nanowires) to resolve the mutual restriction between sensitivity and linearity of piezoresistive tactile sensors. The derived series&#8208;parallel switching enables the ultrawide linear range (0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa) and ultrahigh sensitivity (1546.35 kPa&#8722;1). The work opens up promising strategies for future high&#8208;performance flexible tactile sensors toward diverse application scenarios.








Abstract
The high sensitivity and wide linearity are crucial for flexible tactile sensors in adapting to diverse application scenarios with high accuracy and reliability. However, conventional optimization strategies of constructing microstructures suffer from the mutual restriction between the high sensitivity and wide linearity. Herein, a novel design of localized gradient conductivity (LGC) with partly covered low&#8208;conductivity (low&#8208;&#963;) carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane layer on high&#8208;conductivity (high&#8208;&#963;) silver nanowires film upon the micro&#8208;dome structure is proposed. The LGC configuration enables a unique pressure&#8208;motivated series&#8208;parallel switching to allow the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components to separately take dominant effects in different pressure ranges. The ultrawide linearity can thus be realized by customizing the segmented linear current variation via the rationally associated coverage degree and conductivity gradient of the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components. Moreover, the ultrahigh sensitivity can be originally endowed by the conductivity difference between the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components without compromising linearity. The optimized sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 1546.35 kPa&#8722;1 within an ultrabroad linear sensing range of 0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa, which is first reported. With such an excellent sensing performance, the potential applications, e.g., reliable healthcare monitoring, convenient smart home control, and ground detection of intelligent vehicles, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Optically Controlled Memristor Enabling Synergistic Sensing&#8208;Memory&#8208;Computing for Neuromorphic Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optically controlled KNbO3 memristor is developed. This device utilizes light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancies to regulate the formation of conductive filaments, enabling nonvolatile switching behavior. The memristor demonstrated a high switching ratio (&gt;102), endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, extended retention (&gt;104 s), and pronounced light/dark contrast. These characteristics significantly enhance the visual perception capabilities under complex lighting conditions. The implementation achieved 96% image recognition accuracy, demonstrating substantial progress in bioinspired vision chip technology.








Abstract

Neuromorphic Visual Devices hold considerable promise for integration into neuromorphic vision systems that combine sensing, memory, and computing. This potential arises from their synergistic benefits in optical signal detection and neuro&#8208;inspired computational processes. However, current devices face challenges such as insufficient light/dark resistance ratios, mismatched transient photo&#8208;response, and volatile retention characteristics, limiting their adaptability to complex artificial vision systems. Here, a novel optically controlled memristor is developed by leveraging the unique properties of KNbO3, where resistive switching originates from the dynamic reconstruction of conductive filaments controlled by light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancy charges. Experimental results reveal exceptional reconfigurable electrical characteristics across the 405&#8211;650 nm visible spectrum: optically triggered nonvolatile resistive switching, dual&#8208;modal dark&#8208;state operation, switching ratio &gt;102, endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, retention &gt;104 s, photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio &gt;102, and self&#8208;powered capability. The enhanced light/dark resistance contrast significantly improves visual perception in complex illumination environments, whereas the synergistic interplay between the dynamic photo&#8208;response and nonvolatile storage balances transient signal processing with persistent information retention. In integrated sensing&#8208;memory&#8208;computing tasks, the devices achieved recognition accuracies of 96% and 85% on the standard Jellyfish dataset and its low&#8208;illumination variant, demonstrating technical feasibility and providing a theoretically grounded solution with practical implications for the development of bioinspired vision chips.

The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in 2017 and the spontaneous symmetry&#8208;breaking of the ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTBF)phase in 2024 have made major breakthroughs in the context of self&#8208;assembly materials. This study presents pioneering temperature and voltage&#8208;tunable lasing in both phases, demonstrating multicolor and in&#8208;demand white lasers. Additionally, spontaneously formed emissive fibers are shown, with promising applications for displays and Light Fidelity (Li&#8208;Fi) technologies.








Abstract
Nematic Liquid Crystals (LCs), noted for their simple molecular alignment and broad use in optoelectronics, remain unmodified for over a century. However, in 2017, a unique polar phase, the ferroelectric nematic (NF), is confirmed. Subsequently, in 2024, the revolutionary spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking of ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic chiral structures (NTBF phase) is demonstrated. Nematic LCs are commonly used as optically active matrices for luminescent dyes, allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of emission properties through external fields. In this manuscript, the pioneering temperature&#8208;tunable lasing studies utilizing commercial dyes doped into a mixture that displays the NTBF phase within an exceptionally low&#8208;temperature range of 34&#8211;43.3&#160;&#176;C are shown. The subsequent experiments explore how lasing characteristics within NTBF and NF phases can be employed in a single, compact device to produce multicolor and white lasers. Furthermore, there are introduced spontaneously formed emissive fibers from the NTBF phase. As perspectives, the voltage&#8208;dependent increase of lasing intensity in NF is demonstrated, showing the exceptional result in two differently arranged LC cells. The findings highlight that simple molecules, like those in nature and living organisms, can shape intricate systems with significant implications for the accelerated progress of laser and display technologies, along with Li&#8208;Fi concepts.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of 1.84&#160;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Photovoltaics Beyond 19% via Yb3+ Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those with a bandgap &#8776;1.84&#160;eV, are pivotal for tandem photovoltaics. However, severe halide phase segregation and ion migration critically limit their efficiency and operational stability. In this work, these challenges are addressed through an innovative Yb3&#8314;&#8208;based additive engineering strategy. Based on this strategy, the champion Yb(TFSI)3&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a PCE of 19.06%.








Abstract
Phase segregation remains one of the most critical challenges limiting the performance and long&#8208;term operational stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This issue is especially pronounced in 1.84&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, where severe halide phase segregation leads to compositional heterogeneity and accelerated device degradation. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of halide ion distribution across the surface and bottom interfaces of 1.84&#160;eV perovskite films is conducted, revealing significant Br&#8722;/I&#8722; halide phase segregation that severely impairs device efficiency and stability. To address this, Ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate (Yb(TFSI)3) is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite precursor. The strong coordination between Yb3+ ions and halide anions not only modulates the crystallization kinetics but also homogenizes the spatial distribution of Br&#8208;rich and I&#8208;rich domains, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced compositional heterogeneity. Furthermore, Yb3+ significantly suppresses halide migration and ion exchange processes, thereby enhancing phase stability. Depth&#8208;resolved characterizations, including grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, confirm improved crystallinity, structural uniformity, and suppressed phase segregation across the film depth. As a result, the champion device achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.06% and retains 85% of its initial efficiency after 1500&#160;h in a nitrogen atmosphere (10% RH, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Mechanoluminescent Aluminum Nitride Crystal for Super&#8208;Sensitive Optical Manometry, Thermometry and Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first discovery of intrinsic mechanoluminescence in undoped AlN crystals, accompanied by pronounced photoluminescence and persistent luminescence. It further demonstrates a defect&#8208;emission&#8211;driven multifunctional optical sensing platform for force, pressure, and temperature detection, achieving exceptional sensitivities.








Abstract
AlN is a core material widely used as a substrate and heat sink in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Introducing luminescent properties into intrinsic AIN opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation intelligent sensors, self&#8208;powered displays, and wearable electronics. In this study, the first evidence is presented of AlN crystals exhibiting satisfactory mechanoluminescence (ML), photoluminescence (PL), and afterglow performance, demonstrating their potential as novel multifunctional optical sensors. A series of undoped AlN crystals (ranging from &#181;m to mm scale) is successfully synthesized on tungsten substrates via physical vapor transport. A multimodal optical sensing platform is developed, showing afterglow and PL for temperature and pressure sensing, and ML for force detection. Despite minimal structural deformation under extreme conditions, attributed to the high bulk modulus of AIN, the optical sensors, driven by intrinsic defect&#8208;related emissions, exhibited excellent sensitivity to temperature and pressure. Notably, significant and previously unreported differences in the PL and ML spectra are observed in response to light and mechanical stimuli, respectively. These spectral variations are attributed to the activation of distinct defect states during PL and ML processes. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study represents a significant step forward in the development of optical sensing technologies for extreme environments and force detection applications.

Abstract
Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. This study demonstrates efficient electrochemical oxidation of PPCPs using a novel tin&#8208;antimony doped carbon nanofiber membrane (Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF) anode leveraging dual&#8208;metal synergy. Oxygen vacancies generated through this synergistic effect function as active sites, enhancing pollutant adsorption capacity and oxidant activation capability. The degradation mechanism proceeds primarily via dominant hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation, leading to complete contaminant mineralization. Notably, Sn/Sb dual&#8208;metal doping modulates the electronic structure, altering the d&#8208;band center from &#8722;4.777 to &#8722;2.175 eV and significantly lowering reaction energy barriers. This electronic optimization facilitates electron transfer kinetics and accelerates pollutant degradation. Owing to this synergy, the Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF anode achieved high removal efficiencies (&gt;90%) within 30 min for multiple PPCPs: ofloxacin (95%), enrofloxacin (91%), carbamazepine (90%), acetaminophen (82%), and ibuprofen (96%). Furthermore, the membrane exhibits potent antimicrobial activity, achieving 4&#8208;log inactivation of tetracycline&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and 5&#8208;log reduction of T7 bacteriophage within 30 min. In real wastewater containing antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria from a treatment plant, the system attained 62% mineralization rate. This work establishes a dual&#8208;metal synergy strategy that provides new avenues for efficient PPCP elimination in complex aqueous matrices.

         <title>Intensifying D&#8208;Orbitals Energy Level Splitting of Local Co Atoms in CoO Lattice for Accelerated Iodine Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced oxygen vacancies in CoO lattice induce low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin state transition at adjacent Co active sites, which optimizes spin&#8208;orbital coupling with I2/I&#8210; molecular orbitals to enable faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions on cathode, thus achieving enhanced energy efficiency of the assembled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.









Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to maximize their power holds the key to address the challenges faced by zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics at the iodine cathode. Herein, oxygen vacancies is innovatively introduced into CoO lattice to create high&#8208;spin&#8208;state Co active sites in nonstoichiometric CoO1&#8331;x nanocrystals supported by carbon nanofibers (H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs). This simple strategy intensifies crystal field splitting of Co 3d orbitals, optimizing the spin&#8208;orbital coupling between Co 3d orbitals and iodine species. The resulting enhanced availability of more unpaired electrons in non&#8208;degenerate eg orbitals facilitates faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions, thus improved reaction kinetics. Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs/I2 cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&#8210;1), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8210;1) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I2 cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&#8210;1/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The introduced oxygen vacancies in CoO lattice induce low-to-high spin state transition at adjacent Co active sites, which optimizes spin-orbital coupling with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt; molecular orbitals to enable faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions on cathode, thus achieving enhanced energy efficiency of the assembled Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to maximize their power holds the key to address the challenges faced by zinc-iodine batteries (ZIBs), including the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics at the iodine cathode. Herein, oxygen vacancies is innovatively introduced into CoO lattice to create high-spin-state Co active sites in nonstoichiometric CoO&lt;sub&gt;1&#8331;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals supported by carbon nanofibers (H-CoO&lt;sub&gt;1&#8331;x&lt;/sub&gt;/CNFs). This simple strategy intensifies crystal field splitting of Co 3d orbitals, optimizing the spin-orbital coupling between Co 3d orbitals and iodine species. The resulting enhanced availability of more unpaired electrons in non-degenerate e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals facilitates faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions, thus improved reaction kinetics.

         <title>Direct Writing of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Mo2C Enabled by Low&#8208;Temperature Laser Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Molybdenum carbide electrocatalysts exhibit limited hydrogen evolution performance due to excessively strong Mo&#8208;H interactions. Low&#8208;temperature laser deposition enables the kinetic stabilization of metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C with optimized electronic structure, delivering high activity and long&#8208;term durability for acidic hydrogen production at industrial current densities.








Abstract
Molybdenum carbides have gained tremendous attention for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their high electrical conductivity and similar d&#8208;band structure to platinum. Among molybdenum carbides, Mo2C catalysts have exhibited greater potential for acidic HER. However, their performance is restricted by the strong binding interaction between molybdenum and hydrogen. Herein, a series of Mo2C catalysts are synthesized using a rapid, low&#8208;temperature laser deposition method to dope oxygen atoms into the Mo2C lattices. The metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C exhibits a low overpotential of 125 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, showing significant improvement compared to Mo2C (&#8776;182 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of oxygen into the lattices of Mo2C can reduce the hydrogen adsorption free energy, indicating that hydrogen production is more favorable on oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst. At the industrial&#8208;level current density of 1 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, the oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with a low overpotential of 312 mV. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining consistent hydrogen production for 200 h (&gt;8 days) in 0.5 M H2SO4, potentially&#160;outperforming most non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts. This work highlights a new method to synthesize high&#8208;performance transition metal carbide catalysts with a tunable electronic structure to enhance HER performance.

A new concept, &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue,&#8221; is introduced, where enzyme&#8208;induced silicification is employed to enhance enzyme stability, improve interactions with supports, and prevent pore blocking. Due to its simplicity, reliability, and scalability, this approach offers a transformative advancement in enzyme immobilization for industrial applications.








Abstract
The development of novel methods to enhance enzyme&#8208;carrier interactions in situ, at a feasible cost, and on a large scale is crucial for improving the stability and durability of current immobilized enzyme systems used in industrial settings. Here, a pioneering approach termed &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; is proposed, which utilizes protein&#8208;catalyzed silicification to fix enzyme within porous matrix while preserving enzyme activity. This innovative strategy offers several key benefits, including conformational stabilization of enzymes, improved interactions between enzymes and the matrix, prevention of enzyme leakage, and mitigation of pore blocking. Moreover, the controllable and scalable nature of this method renders it a cost&#8208;effective solution for enhancing enzyme immobilization in industrial contexts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; technology, it has applied to three different enzymes exhibiting varying surface characteristics, sizes, and functions and in diverse porous supports, including a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and a commercial macroporous resin, which resulted in a significant improvement of the stability and longevity of the immobilized enzymes. Overall, this findings represent a significant advancement in enzyme immobilization techniques, signaling a paradigm shift in current industrial catalysis.

         <title>Critical Role of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Tunnel Structure Within Hard Carbon in Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

The desolvation and weak capillary effect of UMTS can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte and thus significantly enhance the ICE, which also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, effectively enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity.








Abstract
Accurately constructing pore structures and clarifying the relationship between pore structure and sodium storage performance to obtain high&#8208;quality hard carbon (HC) is crucial for the commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously obtain HC with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), excellent rate performance, and satisfactory capacity in ester electrolytes by modifying the pore structure. Herein, the challenge is innovatively addressed by optimizing the dechlorination polymerization reaction to obtain the precursor, thereby modulating the carbon atom structure rearrangement and preoxidation process to design the HC with ultra&#8208;microporous tunnel structure (UMTS). The desolvation of UMTS (&lt;1&#160;nm) and the weak capillary effect at the surface can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte at the electrode surface and thus significantly enhance the ICE. The UMTS also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, greatly enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity. As a result, especially in ester electrolyte, the optimized material demonstrates an ultrahigh ICE of 90.9%, good rate performance (108.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1) and an outstanding reversible capacity (357.2 mAh g&#8722;1 with 98.3% of the capacity contribution below 1&#160;V). This design concept of precisely constructing UMTS contributes significantly to the rational design of high&#8208;quality HC anode, and may be extended to other battery systems to promote the ongoing advancement of battery technology.

         <title>Non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;Based Magnetic Polymer Sorbents for Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Compounds from Landfill Leachate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents featuring non&#8208;per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (non&#8208;PFAS)&#8208;based fluorinated and cationic groups enable selective and efficient removal of multiple PFAS from complex landfill leachate. By optimizing functional group balance and polymer design, the sorbents achieve &gt;90% removal, excellent reusability, and outperform commercial materials&#8212;offering a promising solution for PFAS remediation in challenging real&#8208;world water matrices.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are carcinogenic and environmentally persistent contaminants, necessitating their efficient removal to protect environmental and human health. In this study, a series of fluorinated, non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;based magnetic polymer sorbents is developed for the selective removal of multiple PFAS from landfill leachate containing high levels of co&#8208;contaminants. Crosslinked polymer networks are shown to enhance both magnetic separation and PFAS sorption performance. The magnetic sorbent with a higher proportion of quaternary ammonium groups and a lower proportion of fluorinated segments shows improved sorption kinetics for most PFAS and greater sorption capacity for perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), the most abundant compound in the tested landfill leachate. However, this formulation exhibits lower sorption selectivity and reduced equilibrium removal efficiencies when PFAS are present at low initial concentrations. A compact and portable treatment device is constructed to simulate practical deployment. The system achieves high PFAS removal efficiencies (&gt;90% for the majority of PFAS) and maintains good regeneration and reusability over five sorption&#8208;desorption cycles at environmentally relevant concentrations. Compared to four commercially available sorbents, the developed magnetic polymer sorbents exhibit superior performance in PFAS removal, indicating their potential as efficient candidates for remediating PFAS from landfill leachate.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are carcinogenic and environmentally persistent contaminants, necessitating their efficient removal to protect environmental and human health. In this study, a series of fluorinated, non-PFAS-based magnetic polymer sorbents is developed for the selective removal of multiple PFAS from landfill leachate containing high levels of co-contaminants. Crosslinked polymer networks are shown to enhance both magnetic separation and PFAS sorption performance. The magnetic sorbent with a higher proportion of quaternary ammonium groups and a lower proportion of fluorinated segments shows improved sorption kinetics for most PFAS and greater sorption capacity for perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), the most abundant compound in the tested landfill leachate. However, this formulation exhibits lower sorption selectivity and reduced equilibrium removal efficiencies when PFAS are present at low initial concentrations. A compact and portable treatment device is constructed to simulate practical deployment. The system achieves high PFAS removal efficiencies (&amp;gt;90% for the majority of PFAS) and maintains good regeneration and reusability over five sorption-desorption cycles at environmentally relevant concentrations. Compared to four commercially available sorbents, the developed magnetic polymer sorbents exhibit superior performance in PFAS removal, indicating their potential as efficient candidates for remediating PFAS from landfill leachate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Electrode Smoothing by Controlling the Nucleation Phase of Metal Deposition Through Polymer&#8208;Substrate Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how polyethylene oxide (PEO) facilitates smooth electrode deposition using in situ experiments and simulations. PEO does not bind to Zn or Zn2+ to control growth but adsorbs on Cu, tuning Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfacial energy. This promotes the nucleation of flat&#8208;lying Zn (002) platelets and confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow region near the interface.








Abstract
Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and many other battery systems. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, the knowledge gap is addressed by using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on Cu substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions, which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, the results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near&#8208;surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

         <title>Revisiting Ferroelectric&#8208;Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse&#8208;Inspired Approach to In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) enables linear and multilevel modulation of photoconductance through partial polarization switching and photogating effects. The device achieves photonic non&#8208;volatility over a 153&#160;dB dynamic range and performs in&#8208;sensor processing under unstructured illumination, demonstrating enhanced face recognition accuracy by recalibrating distorted visual inputs into a pre&#8208;trained range.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices inspired by the tripartite synapse system offer enhanced modulation of synaptic weight via a third terminal. However, using an electrically independent terminal for memorizing and processing optical information remains unexplored. Here, a ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) incorporating ferroelectric polymers and organic photoactive channels is revisited for neuromorphic vision systems. It is demonstrated that partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric gate insulator enables linear control of the photoactive channel. Furthermore, the photogating effect induced by charge trapping at the ferroelectric insulator/photoactive channel interface further enhances the photonic non&#8208;volatile (PNV) characteristics of the FGPT. This allows memorized visual information, expressed as photoconductance, to be incrementally potentiated or depressed. The modulated photoconductance fully spans the current level within the dynamic range of the device (153&#160;dB). Finally, the feasibility of the device for all&#8208;day face recognition is shown by in&#8208;sensor processing of visual information obtained from unstructured environments into the pre&#8208;trained range. This approach results in up to a &#8776;40% improvement in recognition accuracy.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of Required Facilitators for Microenvironment Remodeling Propels Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid conduit integrates electrospun nanofibers with bioactive hydrogels for spatiotemporal delivery of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. Initially, CAT release reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, while subsequent EGF delivery provides a supportive substrate for axon growth. Combined with NT3 and GDNF, it enhances axon regeneration and synaptic plasticity, ultimately improving motor and bladder function.








Abstract
Intricate pathological responses and multiple components within the lesion make it challenging to repair spinal cord injury (SCI). A multifunctional hybrid neural restorative conduit is developed, composed of a sandwich&#8208;like hydrogel encapsulated within a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane. The sandwich structure consists of a hyaluronic acid&#8208;graft&#8208;dopamine (HADA)/HGF&#8208;(RADA)4&#8208;DGDRGDS (HRR) hydrogel loaded with epidermal growth factor (EGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and glial&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), flanked by gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels containing catalase at both ends. The hybrid conduit enables the spatiotemporal release of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. This approach reduces oxidative stress, promotes neuronal survival at the lesion borders, facilitates the relay of ascending and descending axons, and enhances signal transmission across the lesion. Restored serotonergic signaling enhances motor neuron excitability, facilitating functional recovery, while reconstitution of bladder reflexes improves urinary control. By orchestrating the reinstatement of multiple essential mechanisms to counteract the pathological progression of the hostile post&#8208;SCI microenvironment, this approach provides a strategy for regenerative therapies targeting SCI.

         <title>Biologically Switchable Volatility and Nonvolatility Toward Real Neurotransmitter Mediated Aqueous Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated volatility and nonvolatility of a PCN&#8208;224/WO3&#8208;gated organic photoelectrochemical transistor, a complete aqueous reservoir computing system is developed and implemented for image preprocessing and recognition, in which the reservoir is constructed based on the volatile property, while the readout network is operated upon the nonvolatile property of the device.








Abstract
The study on aqueous reservoir computing (RC) has just come into being. Nevertheless, aqueous RC still faces significant challenges. Recently, with the participation of real biological receptors, aqueous neuromorphic engineering is promising to emulate the intricate human brain more closely due to their synaptic resemblance in electrolytes. In this work, biologically switchable volatility and nonvolatility are first explored for real neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated aqueous RC application, which is based on rational synergy between glutamate oxidase catalytic chemistry and porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework/tungsten oxide (PCN&#8208;224/WO3) photogate in the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor. As a proof of concept, the glutamate&#8208;mediated RC is then developed and explored for image recognition. These results have of potential for advancing real neurotransmitter&#8208;mediated aqueous RC toward in&#8208;biology application, which are also envisaged to promote bioinspired algorithm&#8208;hardware codesign in future aqueous neuromorphic engineering.

         <title>Microstructure Optimization via Grain&#8208;Boundary Segregation to Enhance DC Bias Dielectric Performance of BaTiO3 Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning grain size through nanoscale grain&#8208;boundary segregation of single&#8208;element additives, high&#8208;performance BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) exhibit exceptionally low dielectric loss over a wide frequency range and excellent thermal stability. In particular, an optimal grain size is identified for maximizing effective capacitance under high DC bias fields, offering a key strategy to enable thinner dielectric layers in future MLCCs.








Abstract
BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are essential components in modern electronics. To enhance overall capacitance, achieving thinner ceramic layers has become a primary issue. However, this introduces two major challenges: controlling grain size during processing and ensuring stability under high electric fields. In this study, a novel strategy employing single&#8208;element additives such as Fe3&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; is presented to effectively suppress grain growth. These additives strongly segregate at grain boundaries, thereby limiting grain coarsening during sintering and enabling fine&#8208;grained microstructures. The optimized BaTiO&#8323; samples, free of costly rare&#8208;earth elements, exhibit stable high permittivity (&#8776;103), low dielectric loss, and improved reliability across varying temperatures and frequencies. More importantly, we identify the ideal grain size of &#8776;200&#160;nm for maximizing capacitance under a DC bias exceeding 4&#160;V&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. The findings suggest that further reducing the dielectric layer thickness to 200&#160;nm represents a promising direction for future MLCCs.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Ring Bonding Electron Donor Structure Triggers Efficient Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, electron delocalization within the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) is enhanced. This increased delocalization improves the photocatalyst's oxidation capability and facilitates hole distribution at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, thereby triggering the efficient two&#8208;electron water oxidation reactions (2e&#8722; WOR).








Abstract
Low water oxidation efficiency is a major barrier to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis under sacrificial agent&#8208;free conditions. Among various water oxidation pathways, the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) is promising due to its direct H2O2 generation and kinetic advantages. However, effective strategies to trigger the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR remain insufficient. In this study, conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor and acceptor units are designed and synthesized. By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated, increasing H2O2 synthesis efficiency from 1657 to 4401 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 1.25%. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated by the inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure, which enhances electron delocalization in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), increasing the valence band potential from 1.6 to 1.8 V, thereby meeting the oxidation potential required for the 2e&#8722; WOR. Additionally, this structure promotes hole accumulation at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, boosting water oxidation efficiency from 874 to 2767 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work presents a promising strategy for improving photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency, advancing sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Synthesis of 2D Semiconductor Lateral Patterned Heterostructures Through Carving and Follow&#8208;Up Robust Epitaxial Growth Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using high&#8208;speed laser carving to achieve precisely controlled two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor material patterns. These patterns serve as a stable template for the lateral epitaxial growth of other 2D materials, enabling the fabrication of 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays, and patterned heterostructures.








Abstract
Precise control over the spatial distribution of chemical composition and electronic structure in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for the development of next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, fabricating 2D lateral patterned heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and high spatial periodicity remains a significant challenge. Herein, this work reports a general strategy to synthesize 2D semiconductor lateral patterned heterostructures through carving of 2D semiconductor single crystal and the follow&#8208;up robust epitaxial growth approach. Using the high&#8208;speed laser carving (HSLC) technique, this work obtains precisely controlled 2D semiconductor material patterns with clean edges, which are used as a robust template for laterally epitaxial growth to produce 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays and other complex patterned heterostructures. Systematic microscopic and spectral characterization reveal that heterostructures have atomically sharp interlines. The high periodicity of these heterostructures facilitates scalable device integration, providing a practical route toward large&#8208;area 2D electronic circuits. By constructing functional electronic components such as p&#8208;n diode and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverters arrays, this work demonstrates the potential of these heterostructures for monolithic circuit applications. This technique offers a new idea for micro/nano machining of 2D materials and lays a foundation for large&#8208;scale integrated circuits based on 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;Inspired Composite Conduit Accelerates Peripheral Nerve Regeneration through Synergistic Oriented Structure and Piezoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bamboo&#8208;inspired composite conduit is designed to promote the repair of long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury, where a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure provides topological guidance for cell migration, and the newly discovered piezoelectric property of poly(vinyl alcohol) of exceeding 100 mV enhances axon length by 3.1 times, ultimately improving nerve regeneration efficiency through accelerating neuronal migration, axonal extension, and vascularization.








Abstract
Slow axon growth is a critical factor that limits regeneration after long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Herein, a bamboo&#8208;inspired scaffold accelerates nerve regeneration through a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure and biomimetic piezoelectric property. The outer hydrogel of the scaffold exhibits sufficient fatigue resistance after 100 cycles of stretching, while the interior fiber provides an oriented topological cue. Inspired by the bending&#8208;piezoelectric property of bamboo cellulose, the piezoelectric signal in poly(vinyl alcohol) is detected for the first time, measuring approximately 20&#160;mV. To enhance voltage&#8208;driven nerve regeneration, the scaffold's piezoelectricity is improved to 0.95 &#177; 0.02&#160;V by optimizing its non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, increasing permanent dipole moment, and facilitating electron&#8208;hole separation. Owing to its biomimetic structure and piezoelectricity, the scaffold promotes a 3.1&#8208;fold increase in axon length, a 1.6&#8208;fold improvement in myelin diameter, and maximizes angiogenesis, reaching 71.25 &#177; 21.87 vessels per mm2 in vivo. Overall, this bamboo&#8208;inspired conduit has the potential to significantly improve regeneration efficiency and functional reconstruction in cases of long&#8208;segment PNI.

         <title>Vascular&#8208;Mimetic 2D Membranes with Hemoglobin Catalysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO in GO&#8208;RBC membranes induces the reorganization of phospholipid bilayers to form hydrophobic &#8220;hemoglobin islands&#8221; embedded in a hydrophilic &#8220;phospholipid sea&#8221;. This structure forces the uranium ions to move along an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped trajectory, which greatly enhances their interaction with hemoglobin and improves the ability to catalyze the conversion of uranium (VI) to uranium (IV).








Abstract
The extraction of uranium from seawater is crucial for sustainable nuclear energy development but is challenged by its ultralow concentration, the presence of competing ions, and the high energy demands of conventional methods. Membrane separation is a promising alternative, owing to its in simplicity, low energy consumption, and scalability. However, current membranes fail to achieve the selectivity and efficiency required for uranium capture.

&lt;p&gt;GO in GO-RBC membranes induces the reorganization of phospholipid bilayers to form hydrophobic &#8220;hemoglobin islands&#8221; embedded in a hydrophilic &#8220;phospholipid sea&#8221;. This structure forces the uranium ions to move along an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped trajectory, which greatly enhances their interaction with hemoglobin and improves the ability to catalyze the conversion of uranium (VI) to uranium (IV).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extraction of uranium from seawater is crucial for sustainable nuclear energy development but is challenged by its ultralow concentration, the presence of competing ions, and the high energy demands of conventional methods. Membrane separation is a promising alternative, owing to its in simplicity, low energy consumption, and scalability. However, current membranes fail to achieve the selectivity and efficiency required for uranium capture. Herein, this study introduces a bioinspired graphene oxide-red blood cells (GO-RBC) membrane, that mimics vascular transport for ultra-selective uranium extraction. In the innovative GO-induced remodeling of red blood cell, hemoglobin (Hb) adsorbs onto the hydrophobic regions of GO and, phospholipids self-assemble into concentric hydrophilic rings around Hb. This unique &#8220;island-reef&#8221; structure within the membrane channels forces ions to follow an S-shaped path, thereby enhancing interactions with Hb. In addition, Hb catalytically reduces U(VI) to U(IV), enabling trapping of uranium while allowing competing ions to pass through. The membrane achieves an unprecedented U/V selectivity (110.6), far outperforming current technologies. Moreover, the GO-RBC membrane exhibited exceptional antifouling properties, mechanical robustness, and long-term stability. This study provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for uranium extraction from seawater, further opening new pathways for the development of biomimetic membranes for application in resource recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A Generative Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for the Discovery of Novel Magnesium&#8208;Based Solvents.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods are inefficient and costly in discovering novel solvents for next&#8208;generation magnesium (Mg) metal&#8208;based batteries. Therefore, this work establishes a simple yet efficient screening criterion for solvents by integrating artificial intelligence techniques with a virtual molecular database, potentially revolutionizing the traditional solvent design pathway. A total of 823 solvents are generated using a self&#8208;developed algorithm, and LUMO, &#916;LUMO, ESPmin, ESPmax&#8201;, and Eb are identified to establish the screening criterion through the analysis with machine learning (ML) models. Eighteen candidate solvents are successfully identified, and two of which are subsequently selected and experimentally validated, i.e., C1COCOC1 and COCC(C)OC (abbreviated as &#8220;DOX&#8221; and &#8220;DMP&#8221;). Notably, neither of these solvents has been previously reported for use in Mg batteries. Experimental results indicate that the DOX solvent, when paired with the Mg boron&#8208;based salt, i.e., Mg[B(hfip)4]2, can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance. At a current density of 1.0&#8201;mAcm&#8722;2, the average coulombic efficiency for Mg plating/stripping reaches 99.54&#8201;% after 5200 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg//Cu cell achieves a cumulative capacity exceeding 2000&#8201;mAhcm&#8722;2, surpassing previously reported results. In summary, this work establishes a virtual molecular database and develops a streamlined screening methodology for Mg battery solvents based on their physicochemical properties, reducing the candidate pool from 823 to 18 and improving efficiency by nearly 50&#8208;fold. This research paradigm is not limited to the development of Mg batteries and can be readily extended to the exploration of other battery systems.

         <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra&#8208;Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate ultra&#8208;strong coupling to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer.The platform achieves exceptional mode overlap, reaching a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode energy.








Abstract
A platform is introduced to achieve ultra&#8208;strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light&#8211;matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single&#8208;photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low&#8208;threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q&#8208;factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer. The strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields in tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four&#8208;to&#8208;five&#8208;fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of the approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low&#8208;energy optical modulators.

         <title>Targeted Cascade Therapy with Multifunctional Nanovesicles Engineered from Synergistic Antibacterial Agents for Precision Treatment of Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Infections and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a multifunctional nanovesicle platform is prepared, combining membrane&#8208;disruptive sulfonium polypeptoids, pH&#8208;responsive polypeptoids for acid&#8208;triggered amine release, enzymatic cell wall degradation via lysostaphin, and targeted delivery using D&#8208;phenylalanine ligands. This precision&#8208;guided system integrates synergistic antibacterial mechanisms to effectively tackle drug&#8208;resistant bacteria in various tissue environments.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), classified as a high&#8208;priority tier II pathogen, poses a glowing threat to global health. Single&#8208;mode antibacterial approaches often fall short of achieving optimal effects, necessitating the development of combination therapies. To address these challenges, pH&#8208;responsive antibacterial nanovesicles, termed DAClLy, are developed by integrating targeting ligand and multiple antimicrobial agents with complementary modes of action to target MDR bacteria with enhanced efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. DAClLy are engineered through the complexation of sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing antibacterial polypeptoids, and primary amine&#8208;containing polypeptoids modified with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl maleic anhydride, encapsulating lysostaphin, a bacteriolytic enzyme. Upon reaching the acidic microenvironment of bacterial infections, the DAClLy vesicles disassemble, releasing their antimicrobial components. The released lysostaphin degrades bacterial cell walls, while the polypeptoids synergistically disrupt bacterial membranes, resulting in a multi&#8208;action bactericidal effect. This synergistic mechanism demonstrates remarkable efficacy against MDR S. aureus, including its resilient biofilm formations. In vivo studies have shown that the DAClLy vesicles exhibit potent antibacterial activity against MDR S. aureus&#8208;induced skin and lung infections. The nanovesicles effectively penetrate the lung mucus barrier, addressing both surface&#8208;level and deep&#8208;tissue infections. By integrating multiple strategies, DAClLy offers a promising therapeutic strategy to combat MDR pathogens across diverse tissue contexts.

         <title>Gridized Nanopolymer Catalysis with Atomically Dispersed Iron Achieves the Nearly 100% Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;based nanomolecular/nanopolymer catalysts with super&#8208;hindrance and low&#8208;coordination Fe sites enable efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol (CH3OH). The super&#8208;hindrance prevents aggregation to guarantee active site dispersion. The stronger *CO adsorption, compared to Fe porphyrin, is crucial for the high selective production of CH3OH instead of CO. Fe&#8208;based nanopolymer catalyst demonstrates 60.5% CH3OH FE, 98.3% CH3OH selectivity, and 100 h stability in an H&#8208;cell.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) offers a highly promising avenue for zero&#8208;emission carbon recycling and renewable energy storage. However, achieving high CH3OH selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalysts remains rare, presenting central challenges on the path to their commercialization. It is emerging to make multiscale design of metal centers of active sites and their surrounding environments under the crucial mechanism of pathway selection. Herein, the gridized nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysts are reported for high effective electroreduction of CO2 to CH3OH. An A&#8208;type nanogrid (AG) and its organic nanopolymers with atomically dispersed iron (Fe) are well identified with the unique catalytic active sites of Fe&#8208;N1C3Cl1. Notably, Fe&#8208;based AG nanopolymer (FePAG) catalyst exhibits a CH3OH Faradaic efficiency of 60.5%, a CH3OH selectivity of 98.3%, and a stability of up to 100 h, outperforming currently reported molecular catalysts. The superior selectivity is probably attributed to the cooperation between the stronger *CO adsorption and the super&#8208;hindrance that suppresses aggregates to guarantee the dispersion of single active sites. This study provides new insights in the exploration of nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Fe-based nanomolecular/nanopolymer catalysts with super-hindrance and low-coordination Fe sites enable efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH). The super-hindrance prevents aggregation to guarantee active site dispersion. The stronger *CO adsorption, compared to Fe porphyrin, is crucial for the high selective production of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH instead of CO. Fe-based nanopolymer catalyst demonstrates 60.5% CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH FE, 98.3% CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity, and 100 h stability in an H-cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) offers a highly promising avenue for zero-emission carbon recycling and renewable energy storage. However, achieving high CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity and long-term stability in catalysts remains rare, presenting central challenges on the path to their commercialization. It is emerging to make multiscale design of metal centers of active sites and their surrounding environments under the crucial mechanism of pathway selection. Herein, the gridized nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysts are reported for high effective electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH. An A-type nanogrid (AG) and its organic nanopolymers with atomically dispersed iron (Fe) are well identified with the unique catalytic active sites of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, Fe-based AG nanopolymer (FePAG) catalyst exhibits a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH Faradaic efficiency of 60.5%, a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity of 98.3%, and a stability of up to 100 h, outperforming currently reported molecular catalysts. The superior selectivity is probably attributed to the cooperation between the stronger *CO adsorption and the super-hindrance that suppresses aggregates to guarantee the dispersion of single active sites.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Nanoagents with Efficient Free Radicals Generation and Photothermal Conversion Performance for Enhanced Tumor Photoimmunotherapy via Targeting Lactate Metabolism&#8208;Immune Circuit Rewiring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy using L8@SY NPs to inhibit lactate efflux and enhance photoimmunotherapy. L8@SY NPs with high free radical generation and photothermal conversion performance can induce immunogenic cell death. Meanwhile, lactate efflux blockade effectively augments photoimmunotherapy by reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment, demonstrating significant tumor growth suppression and reduced metastasis.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have emerged as promising modalities against tumor growth and distant metastases via inducing apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, their therapeutic efficacy is profoundly compromised by the acidic tumor microenvironment fueled by lactate extrusion, orchestrating multifaceted immunosuppression. Herein, a lactate metabolism checkpoint blockade strategy targeting monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is proposed to augment photoimmunotherapy by co&#8208;delivering MCT4 inhibitor syrosingopine (SY) and a phototheranostic agent L8BO (L8). Boasting robust intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics and an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated architecture with lengthy alkyl chains, L8 possesses a diminished singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;S&#8208;T) alongside elevated light&#8208;harvesting property, achieving exceptional free radicals generation and 46.2% photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Triggered by lactate sequestration&#8208;induced intracellular acidification, L8@SY nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;enabled photoimmunotherapy potently activates dendritic cells (DCs) maturation while eliciting substantial infiltration of T lymphocytes. Concurrently, natural killer (NK) cell activation and memory T&#8208;cell differentiation are achieved, thereby suppressing both localized and distal tumor progression whilst concomitantly curtailing pulmonary metastatic dissemination. In brief, this study provides a novel combinatorial paradigm to potentiate photoimmunotherapy by targeting the lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy.

         <title>Recyclable Polyurethane Thermosets with High Rigidness and Toughness via Side Chain Induced Dual Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable rigid polyurethane thermoset is presented via a side chain&#8208;induced dual phase separation strategy. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded hard domains and side&#8208;chain nanodomains synergistically enhance toughness, while urethane transesterification ensures catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability. The material achieves high modulus (1.13 GPa), exceptional toughness (77.8 MJ m&#8722;3), and demonstrates recyclability in glass fiber composites.








Abstract
Polyurethane thermosets with high strength, rigidity, and cost efficiency are highly desirable for industrial applications. However, they always suffer from brittleness and poor recyclability owing to their crosslinked structure, causing an unacceptable level of sustainability concerns. Here, a side chain induced dual phase separation strategy is proposed to tackle these limitations. Specifically, a crosslinked rigid polyurethane is designed, synthesized from small&#8208;molecule diols with a side chain. The urethane groups form hard domains by hydrogen bonding and induce a primary phase separation. Moreover, the curing process immobilizes part of the polymer segments with side chains to promote a secondary phase separation and generate a heterogeneous crosslinked structure. The primary phase separation enables energy dissipation, while the secondary phase separation serves as stress concentrations or crack initiation points to enhance the toughness. Notably, the transesterification between urethane groups, coupled with hydrogen bonding, facilitates catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability, extending thermosets lifespan. This recyclable polyurethane thermoset exhibits a high Young's modulus (1.13 GPa) and exceptional toughness (77.76 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Furthermore, its application and recyclability in glass fiber&#8208;reinforced composites are demonstrated. This strategy provides a viable route toward sustainable thermosetting polymers, addressing key environmental concerns associated with their widespread use.

         <title>Fine and Uniform Ultrathin Film Coating on Fiber via Nonequilibrium Liquid/Liquid Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber coated with an unprecedentedly micro&#8208;/nanoscale uniform layer, which is long&#8208;sought&#8208;after yet unachievable by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coating technologies, is constructed by locking even liquid film on the fiber in a multiphase fluid coating. The resultant coated composite fiber owns highly efficient function coupling (e.g., supersensitive sensing feature), and can be widespreadly applied to fabric devices.








Abstract
Coating a thin layer on fibers enables their function coupling or integration into differentiated wearable devices, or may unlock unexplored potentials. The thin layer coating's uniformity and controllability is the prerequisite to ensure device's efficiency, but remain, yet, a formidable challenge. Currently, only a few specific composite fibers have been fabricated from flow coating associated with rapid polymerizing liquid monomers, fibers&#8217; parallel handling, or physical scraping, seriously lacking fineness and universality, especially inability reaching nanometer or sub&#8208;micrometer thickness coating. Here, a new method of coating an even liquid film on fiber in another immiscible liquid via capitalizing on fast interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the liquid/liquid interface is proposed. The consequently dried uniform, ultrathin common polymer or composite (predissolved in coated liquid) coating&#8212;with otherwise unattainable thickness ranging 50 nm&#8211;20 &#181;m&#8212;offers fiber with high device performance, including robust service in extreme circumstances (allowing Cu fiber work over the whole range of pH), high efficient display function (with luminous elements &lt;0.01%), and supersensitive sensing with sensor's resistance variation over 90% by less 1 N pressure. The strategy can find extensively diverse applications in wearable electronics and intelligent textiles, as fiber, chemicals of coating liquid, and components, are variable.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Prestressed Niobium Tungsten Oxide Enables Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change and Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step slow&#8208;gradient thermal synthesis strategy to precisely regulate lattice distortion, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage during cycling. This prestressed structure delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and no risk of the battery catching fire or exploding under severe stress conditions.








Abstract
Niobium tungsten oxide offers rapid ionic transport and high safety in fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but suffers from challenges of large structure stresses and low capacity retention at rates exceeding 20C. Here, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 (LP&#8208;NWO) is reported that overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage. The lattice&#8208;prestressed structure involves the alternating distribution of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#215;&#8734; and 4&#160;&#215;&#160;3&#215;&#8734; rectangle units, along with octahedra distortion, which leads to the formation of specific and ordered lattice prestresses. The rectangle units induce tensile stresses, while the octahedra distortion results in compressive stresses. This prestressed structure not only preserves continuous diffusion channels but also enhances both ion and electron conductivity. Importantly, the presence of prestress greatly relieves the strain generated during lithium insertion and extraction. This can be observed through a reversible curve&#8208;to&#8208;straight evolution of lattice fringes, resulting in near&#8208;zero volume change during cycling. The LP&#8208;NWO delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and more than 2&#160;000 cycles of full cells at 50C, as well as no safety risk under severe stress conditions. This prestressed strategy offers implications for the development of zero&#8208;strain electrodes, aiming to overcome fast&#8208;charge limitations through internal means.

&lt;p&gt;By one-step slow-gradient thermal synthesis strategy to precisely regulate lattice distortion, a novel lattice-prestressed Nb&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near-zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage during cycling. This prestressed structure delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and no risk of the battery catching fire or exploding under severe stress conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niobium tungsten oxide offers rapid ionic transport and high safety in fast-charging lithium-ion batteries, but suffers from challenges of large structure stresses and low capacity retention at rates exceeding 20C. Here, a novel lattice-prestressed Nb&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; (LP-NWO) is reported that overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near-zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage. The lattice-prestressed structure involves the alternating distribution of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#215;&#8734; and 4&#160;&#215;&#160;3&#215;&#8734; rectangle units, along with octahedra distortion, which leads to the formation of specific and ordered lattice prestresses. The rectangle units induce tensile stresses, while the octahedra distortion results in compressive stresses. This prestressed structure not only preserves continuous diffusion channels but also enhances both ion and electron conductivity. Importantly, the presence of prestress greatly relieves the strain generated during lithium insertion and extraction. This can be observed through a reversible curve-to-straight evolution of lattice fringes, resulting in near-zero volume change during cycling. The LP-NWO delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and more than 2&#160;000 cycles of full cells at 50C, as well as no safety risk under severe stress conditions. This prestressed strategy offers implications for the development of zero-strain electrodes, aiming to overcome fast-charge limitations through internal means.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multimodal Smart Window with Visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;LWIR Electro&#8208;Modulation for All Weather</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart windows with dynamic regulation of solar visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) transmittance and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) emittance present a crucial solution for improving building energy efficiency. We demonstrate a multimodal smart window with independent electro&#8208;modulation for visible, NIR, and LWIR, ensuring thermal comfort and energy conservation for all weather while offering multifunctionalities of illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection.








Abstract
Intelligent modulation of solar and thermal radiation for a smart window, including visible, near&#8208;infrared (NIR), and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) spectral tri&#8208;bands (0.38&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m), to achieve indoor comfort and energy efficiency is a critical frontier in sustainable building design. However, independent regulations of multi&#8208;functional radiation of visible lighting, NIR heating, and LWIR radiative cooling for dynamic operational requirements and weather conditions are not fully solved. A PET/ITO/PB/Pt&#8208;NPs electrode featuring separated reactions of ion insertion and metal electrodeposition for dual&#8208;band modulation of visible and NIR via precise potential control, enabling multifunctionalities such as illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection is proposed. A multimodal smart window of lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;modulation device (LHE&#8208;ED), wherein electrochromism and dynamic emittance are delicately manipulated for tri&#8208;band modulation, possesses six independent electro&#8208;driven states of multi&#8208;scene lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting regulations for the first time, exhibiting excellent wavelength selectivity of &#9651;TVis&#160;=&#160;41.24%, &#9651;TNIR&#160;=&#160;53.95%, and &#916;&#949;8&#8208;13&#160;&#181;m&#160;=&#160;0.35. Building energy simulations demonstrate the LHE&#8208;ED outperforms commercial low&#8208;E glass across diverse climate zones, showcasing a maximum reduction in CO2 emissions of 34.01&#160;kg&#160;(m2&#160;year)&#8722;1 and a decrease in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)&#160;energy consumption by 34.18% annually, which paves the way for next&#8208;generation smart window in terms of energy saving and environmental preservation.

         <title>Levetiracetam&#8208;Assisted Perovskite Crystallization and Tripartite Lead Iodide Reduction in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method for suppressing residual PbI2: Add chiral LEV molecules to the PbI2 precursor solution to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, release intracellular stress, passivate vacancies and defects, reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk, and achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI2) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb0) under long&#8208;term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing &#945;&#8208;amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI2 precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb2+ ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Inch Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal with High Irradiation Resistance for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 SC were grown with vertical Bridgman method, and the X&#8208;ray detection stability of Au/CsPbBr3/Bi devices after high&#8208;dose irradiation was investigated. We found the change in the Fermi level after irradiation endows the enhancement in sensitivity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;high irradiation hardness for the devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 crystals have demonstrated considerable promise in &#947;&#8208;ray and X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the growth of large single crystals (SCs) and the stability of CsPbBr3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors under high&#8208;energy radiation exposure remain unexplored. In this study, a two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal is grown using the vertical Bridgman (VB) method, and its irradiation resistance in X&#8208;ray detection performance is investigated after exposure to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray radiation. Compared with unirradiated samples, the crystals irradiated with a dose of 10&#160;Mrad exhibit a higher trap density (1.59 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;3) and a lower resistivity (8.2 &#215; 107 &#937; cm). However, the Bi/CsPbBr3/Au devices with asymmetric electrode structure exhibit an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (14), a stable and low dark current density (7 nA cm&#8722;2) with a current drift of 5.8 &#215; 10&#8722;15 A cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 55722 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for X&#8208;ray detection at an electric field of 3000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the irradiated device remained stable X&#8208;ray response characteristics after 220 days aging. These findings highlight the exceptional defect tolerance and irradiation stability of CsPbBr3 devices for high&#8208;performance radiation detections, offering critical insights for their long&#8208;term deployment in high&#8208;radiation environments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an efficient strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 by fabricating Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts that harness the synergistic effects of Ru single atoms and nanoparticles. Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts integrating single&#8208;atom species and nanoparticles maximize atom utilization and hydrogen dissociation for hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges in maintaining consistent metal loadings during synthesis complicate direct performance comparisons with the single&#8208;atom and nanoparticle&#8208;based systems, which obscures rational assessment of their catalytic potential. Herein, Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx photothermal catalysts are reported which leverage the synergy between Ru single atoms and Ru nanoparticles to enhance CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. Under light irradiation (3.1 W cm&#8722;2, 200&#8211;1100 nm) at 200&#160;&#176;C, the Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalyst achieves a CH4 production rate of 197.2 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;100% selectivity, surpassing single&#8208;atom Ru1/CeAlOx catalysts and nanoparticle&#8208;based RuNPs/CeAlOx catalysts, with equivalent metal contents. Mechanistic studies revealed that in Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts, Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance. Moreover, the CeAlOx support effectively stabilizes the dual&#8208;site structure and facilitates the formation of reaction intermediates through its abundant oxygen vacancies and surface Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thereby further enhancing the catalytic reaction. This work highlights the critical role of synergistic effects between single atoms and nanoparticles, offering new approaches for designing high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Free Transfer of Wafer&#8208;Scale Freestanding Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanomembranes Enabled by Elastically Graded Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastically graded polymer (EGP) support is developed to achieve wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of freestanding single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes. The engineered elastic gradient accommodates tensile and compressive strain by tuning interfacial stiffness, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Using this approach, large&#8208;area membranes exhibit pristine surfaces with &#8776;99% intactness, overcoming the critical fracture bottleneck.








Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes have gained increasing attention as promising platforms for both fundamental research and advanced electronic applications. However, internal stress gradients arising from epitaxial strain within the oxide membranes often result in high crack density during fabrication, leading to unsatisfactory yield and limited reliability. Here, an elastically graded polymer (EGP) support that enables wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes are developed. The engineered elastic gradient within the EGP accommodates the internal strain of the oxide membrane, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Notably, this ability to spatially control the interfacial stiffness between the polymer and the oxide film enables crack suppression under both tensile and compressive strain. This approach provides a robust and scalable route to producing high&#8208;quality freestanding oxide membranes, paving the way not only for their integration into novel device architecture but also opening new avenues for scientific exploration of functional systems.

         <title>A Trilayer Nanofluidic Ionic Diode for High&#8208;Performance Moisture&#8208;Enabled Energy Harvesting and Ionic Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the design of p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells, the first trilayer p&#8208;i&#8208;n moist&#8208;electric generator has been developed. This device integrates a positively charged (p&#8208;type) layer, a neutral hygroscopic layer (i&#8208;type), and a negatively charged (n&#8208;type) layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional bilayer p&#8208;n devices and enabling the integration of efficient carrier generation with controllable carrier transport.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ionic diodes enable directional ion transport through confined nanochannels, holding great promise for energy harvesting and iontronic applications. However, their development in moisture&#8208;enabled power generation remains limited by insufficient carrier generation and unstable device performance. Here, a trilayer nanofluidic ionic diode&#8208;based moist&#8208;electric generator is reported, integrating positively charged fabrics, lithium chloride&#8208;doped neutral fabrics, and negatively charged fabrics into a p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration. The hygroscopic neutral layer promotes efficient moisture absorption and ion dissociation, while the adjacent charged layers, featuring nanochannels formed by graphene oxides, establish a built&#8208;in electric field to rectify cation and anion fluxes. This unique structural and functional synergy enables continuous carrier generation and directional transport, achieving both a remarkable voltage of &#8776;1.38 V and a current of &#8776;35 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 and further exhibiting a peak voltage of &#8776;1.6 V with stable operation for over 600 h by employing active metal electrodes. Beyond energy harvesting, the diode&#8208;like rectification allows implementation of ionic logic gates and foldable configurations for powering portable electronics. This work establishes a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance nanofluidic diode&#8208;based devices, bridging sustainable power generation with emerging iontronic systems.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework and Carbon Nitride Composite for Scalable Solar Reforming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular composite, containing a covalent organic framework, indium tin oxide, carbon nitride and nickel based molecular catalyst, enables solar reforming under neutral aqueous conditions, converting polyols and sugars into formate while generating H2. The composite forms scalable photoleaf and photopanel devices, achieving continuous solar&#8208;driven waste valorization and hydrogen production outdoors.








Abstract
Solar reforming uses sunlight to valorize waste and offers a promising route to circular chemistry, but most current systems operate under corrosive conditions, lack scalability and processability, or suffer from poor selectivity in oxidative waste valorization. Here, a modular composite photocatalyst, comprising a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF), cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (CNx), indium tin oxide (ITO), and a nickel&#8208;based molecular catalyst (NiME), capable of driving selective waste valorization and H2 generation using visible light under pH neutral aqueous conditions is reported. The porous structure of the COF provides nanoconfinement, thereby supporting the targeted oxidation of polyols and sugars into formate (HCOO&#8722;), while carbon nitride in the presence of the molecular catalyst facilitates H2 evolution. ITO functions as a solid&#8208;state electron mediator, enabling coupled oxidative and reductive processes for the concurrent solar&#8208;driven production of H2 and HCOO&#8722;. The high processability of the COF|ITO|CNx|NiME composite allows for the construction of a standalone photoleaf and photopanel, which have been integrated into a single&#8208;window and a scalable multi&#8208;window reactor, respectively. Continuous operability over seven days, along with testing under outdoor conditions with pretreated plastic under direct sunlight, offers a pathway toward practical and scalable solar reforming using structurally tunable organic semiconductor composites.

         <title>Dynamic Protective Multi&#8208;Layers for MnO2 Cathodes: Ion Sorting and Structural Protection for Superior Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired dynamic multi&#8208;layer interface combines a stable outer shield, an Mn2+ selective buffer, and a conductive base enriched with oxygen vacancies. The cooperative architecture blocks manganese dissolution, relieves lattice strain, and accelerates ion and electron transport, addressing key stability and kinetic bottlenecks of MnO2 cathodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are characterized by high safety, low cost, and eco&#8208;friendliness, among which manganese&#8208;based cathodes stand out due to their abundance and high theoretical capacity. However, failure behaviors such as lattice collapse, Mn dissolution, and sluggish kinetics hinder their application. Herein, a dynamic multi&#8208;protective interface has been designed through a simple one&#8208;step manufacturing process, emulating the structural and functional attributes of biological membranes and cell walls. It comprises three distinct layers: an outer high&#8208;valent oxide layer that enhances chemical stability and selectively facilitates proton intercalation while governing the intercalation of Zn2+; a middle low&#8208;valent oxide and metal composite layer, which functions as a buffer to selectively adsorb Mn2+, thereby inhibiting Mn dissolution and augmenting the chemical stability of the cathode; and an inner heterojunction layer, which boosts conductivity and alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through lattice distortion and entropy&#8208;mediated electronic delocalization. The surface modified cathode exhibits outstanding stability, with nearly zero capacity decay observed over 300 cycles at a low current density of 0.4 A g&#8722;1, and 15&#160;000 cycles under a high current of 10 A g&#8722;1. With significantly enhanced cycling stability, rate capability, and electrochemical reversibility, this strategy presents a promising solution for high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8208;based cathodes in AZMBs.

&lt;p&gt;A bio-inspired dynamic multi-layer interface combines a stable outer shield, an Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selective buffer, and a conductive base enriched with oxygen vacancies. The cooperative architecture blocks manganese dissolution, relieves lattice strain, and accelerates ion and electron transport, addressing key stability and kinetic bottlenecks of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Anchored Ionic Bond Mediators Enabling Controllable Monolayer Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring Arg on NiOx concurrently mitigates SAM amphiphilicity via ionic bonding and suppresses SAM self&#8208;aggregation by acting as a physical barrier. This bifunctional mechanism enables rapid, controlled assembly of dense, uniform SAM monolayers, yielding PCEs of 26.67% (small&#8208;area PSC, active area: 0.049 cm2) and 21.05% (module, active area: 64.68 cm2).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) has emerged as an indispensable hole&#8208;selective contact for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the formation of dense, uniform SAMs via wet deposition poses challenges due to two thermodynamically feasible yet competing processes: the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules and chemisorption&#8208;driven substrate anchoring. Herein, a rapid and controllable strategy for SAM assembly is presented, enabled by pre&#8208;adsorbed ionic bond mediators. The pre&#8208;anchored arginine (Arg) molecules on nickel oxid (NiOx) can weaken the amphiphilic nature of SAM molecules through ionic bond interaction, while also acting as steric barriers, thereby suppressing the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules. This strategy is compatible with both spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating techniques, enabling rapid and controllable assembly of high&#8208;quality SAM of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl] phosphonic acid. Moreover, the polar guanidinium tail of Arg passivates defects at the buried perovskite interface while strengthening interfacial coupling with the perovskite layer&#8211;enhancing both mechanical stability and electrical contact. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the PSCs achieve high PCEs of up to 26.67% and 21.05% for small&#8208;area devices (active area: 0.049 cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (active area: 64.68 cm2), respectively. Notably, the devices exhibit exceptional operational stability, retaining 93% of their initial PCE after 1700 h of maximum power point tracking under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Enabling Ultra&#8208;High Work Capacity and Scalable Processability of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Densely Entangled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with densely entangled structures are designed and synthesized. These entanglements significantly enhance the mechanical properties, resulting in an unprecedented work capacity during thermal actuation. The reversible nature of the entanglements makes the material easy to process, similar to conventional thermoplastic materials. This combination achieves both high work capacity and scalable processability for LCEs.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are important soft actuators that show strong promise in many fields where traditional rigid actuators or robotics are impractical. However, their real&#8208;world applications are lacking primarily due to inadequate actuation performance and complicated fabrication processes. Here, a novel design is reported that significantly enhances actuation performance while simplifying the fabrication process. The design involves constructing densely entangled structures by synthesizing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear LCEs (&gt;180&#160;kDa) with a moderate number of side groups in a single step. These entangled structures greatly enhance mechanical strength while maintaining toughness, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high actuation work capacity (1427&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). By applying melt shearing or solvent treatment, these entanglements can be temporarily disrupted, providing thermoplastic&#8208;like processability. With these properties, lightweight wearable devices (&lt;10 g) capable of generating over 30&#160;N of contractile force are developed, which is sufficient to reversibly lift an adult male's arm. This work employs a single fabrication step to develop densely entangled LCEs with exceptional actuation performance and thermoplastic&#8208;like processability, signaling a bright future for their applications in rehabilitation devices, wearables, and beyond.

         <title>Thermal Phase Transition Electrolyte for High&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal phase transition aqueous electrolyte incorporating a upper critical solution temperature (UCST)&#8208;type polymer undergoes adaptive phase transitions, forming dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks that suppress water mobility and evaporation, provide self&#8208;regulated thermal buffering under localized heating, and restructure Zn2+ solvation to lower water activity, thereby stabilizing the Zn/electrolyte interface and substantially prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The operational stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) under extreme temperatures is crucial for long&#8208;term energy storage, yet remains hindered by intensified water activity and thermodynamic instability that exacerbate zinc dendrite growth and parasitic reactions. While incorporation of high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point organic solvents has shown effectiveness for high&#8208;temperature operation by reducing water content and disrupting hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, it compromises the intrinsic safety of aqueous electrolyte especially in high&#8208;temperature scenario. Here, a thermoresponsive electrolyte approach is reported leveraging phase transition of a synthesized polymer with upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which achieves temperature&#8208;adaptive electrochemical performance in AZMBs. By modulating polymer&#8208;water interactions and entropy&#8208;enthalpy balance, the engineered aqueous electrolyte undergoes reversible phase transformation above 40 &#176;C, forming a dynamically polymer&#8208;water network that essentially suppresses water reactivity. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8211;Zn symmetric cells exhibit stable Zn plating/stripping for 450 h at 60 &#176;C and 210 h even under extreme 80 &#176;C conditions. High&#8208;loading Zn&#8211;I2 full batteries with enhanced cycling stability further validate practical viability of the thermal phase transition electrolyte at elevated temperature. This work establishes a polymer phase transition paradigm for developing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes, providing mechanistic insights into interfacial stabilization and advancing metal anode technologies for extreme&#8208;condition energy storage systems.

         <title>Engineering the Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite oxide family is demonstrated for the first time to enable efficient electricity generation from water evaporation, and the key role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the performance is discovered. Oxygen vacancies in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; can enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, resulting in stronger water&#8208;solid interaction/more ions transport in capillary channels and ultimately boosting voltage output.

         <title>Regenerative Redox Cycling Enables Stable Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regenerative redox cycling strategy is developed to enable continuous reduction of Sn4+ and dual&#8208;site defect passivation during device operation, thereby enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of tin perovskite devices. The optimized device achieved an efficiency of 15.15% and exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 100% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of simulated day&#8211;night cycling.








Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (THPs) suffer from low stability due to the easy oxidation of Sn (II). Although traditional reduction strategies effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn (II), the gradual depletion of reducing agents during continuous device operation significantly weakens their antioxidative capacity, thereby limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the device. Herein, a regenerative redox cycling strategy utilizing 4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (4&#8208;MBA) is proposed. Under operational conditions, UV irradiation enables 4&#8208;MBA regeneration, which concurrently drives continuous Sn (IV)&#8208;to&#8208;Sn (II) reduction and facilitates dual&#8208;site defect passivation, significantly enhancing device efficiency and stability. Ultimately, an excellent efficiency of 15.15% is achieved and maintained 100% of the initial efficiency for 1100 h in a simulated day&#8211;night cycle maximum power point tracking (MPPT) test. This work provides a sustainable reduction strategy that effectively addresses the long&#8208;term stability issue of tin perovskite photovoltaic cells.

Although traditional reduction strategies effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn (II), the gradual depletion of reducing agents during continuous device operation significantly weakens their antioxidative capacity, thereby limiting the long-term stability of the device. Herein, a regenerative redox cycling strategy utilizing 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) is proposed. Under operational conditions, UV irradiation enables 4-MBA regeneration, which concurrently drives continuous Sn (IV)-to-Sn (II) reduction and facilitates dual-site defect passivation, significantly enhancing device efficiency and stability.

The macro&#8208;experiences of aging are the result of an accumulation of micro&#8208;changes that occur over time.








Abstract
The disparity between the global increase in life expectancy and the steady decline in health outcomes with age has been a major driver for developing new ways to research aging. Although this current tools for studying aging outside of the human body&#8212;such as animal models and cells in a dish&#8212;have improved this fundamental understanding of the markers and key mechanisms underlying this process, several limitations remain. Animal models are poor biological representations of humans and have a weak track record of translating pre&#8208;clinical results into successful clinical applications. Similarly, current 2D cellular models do not recapitulate the dynamic 3D environment of human tissue. This gap between the need for accurate biological mimicry and the limitations of current aging models presents an exciting opportunity for the field of biofabrication. Over the past decade, the combination of biofabrication and advanced biomaterials has shown potential to engineer high&#8208;resolution features that change over time or respond to specific stimuli. In this perspective, the current state of in vitro aging models is reflected, identify the key features that new models must emulate, discuss the technologies available to meet these complex specifications, and consider some of the potential challenges facing the field.

Membrane technologies can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of chemical separations in energy&#8208;water systems. Improving our understanding and design of separation membranes will require studying their properties at the molecular scale, mesoscale, and macroscale. This perspective highlights advanced characterization techniques for revealing membrane properties and performance across length scales and discusses the challenges involved with characterizing membranes under realistic conditions.

         <title>Multidentate Chelation by Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Enables High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first use of a covalent organic framework (COF) as a precursor additives for TPSC. Two types of COFs can effectively passivate defects and optimize the interface energy level arrangement. Therefore, the TPSC with added COF achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.29% (certified 15.88%), an open circuit voltage of 0.95&#160;V, and a fill factor of 79.47%, and exhibited excellent stability.








ABSTRACT
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) represent a highly promising photovoltaic technology owing to their eco&#8208;friendliness and near&#8208;ideal bandgap, which approaches the single&#8208;junction efficiency limit. However, the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ ions in tin&#8208;based perovskites induces high defect densities and hampers charge transport, significantly limiting device performance. In this study, we report the first use of two imine&#8208;linked donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring abundant surface binding groups, BCTB&#8208;BTD&#8208;COF and BCTB&#8208;BSD&#8208;COF, as precursor additives for TPSCs. Both COFs effectively suppress oxidation of Sn2+ ions and passivate defects, while BCTB&#8208;BSD&#8208;COF exhibits superior performance through multidentate chelation, enabling defect passivation, reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, and optimized interfacial energy&#8208;level alignment. Consequently, the addition of COFs significantly improved the performance of TPSCs, while BCTB&#8208;BSD&#8208;COF&#8208;based TPSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.29% (certified 15.88%) with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.95&#160;V and a fill factor of 79.47%. These devices also demonstrate exceptional stability, retaining 85% of its initial PCE after 35 days of continuous illumination. This work presents a novel strategy for passivating defects in TPSCs and offers a promising pathway toward high&#8208;performance TPSCs.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Driven Bioshield Remodels Diabetic Oral Microenvironment for Accelerated Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively charged and adhesive bioshield was constructed to remodel the diabetic oral microenvironment for accelerated wound healing. The high net charge of bioshield enabled neutrophil extracellular traps neutralization and resisted bacterial biofilm formation. This traps clearance thereby mitigating inflammation&#8208;mediated suppression of focal adhesion signaling, which coordinately enhances diabetic wound healing through improved epithelial migration, endothelial proliferation, and angiogenesis.








ABSTRACT
Diabetic chronic wounds, especially in the moist and mechanically dynamic oral environment, pose a significant therapeutic challenge due to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)&#8208;mediated inflammation, biofilm infections, and extracellular matrix remodeling defects. To address this challenge, we develop a protein&#8208;based adhesive bioshield, functioning through the combined action of physical blocking and electrostatic interaction, that simultaneously acts as a bacterial barrier and NETs scavenger, thereby reactivating the focal adhesion signaling. The protein's high&#8208;density lysine residues establish a robust adhesion network that resists the dynamic oral environment while creating a persistent antibacterial bioshield. Notably, the high net charge of adhesive bioshield enables rapid NETs neutralization by electrostatically binding cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA), which reduces local NETs levels and inflammatory responses. This NETs clearance subsequently alleviates inflammation&#8208;mediated suppression of focal adhesion signaling, which coordinately accelerates diabetic wound healing through enhanced epithelial migration, endothelial proliferation, and angiogenesis. Overall, this study presents a charge&#8208;driven therapeutic strategy that targets NETs&#8208;mediated inflammation, offering an alternative approach for managing diabetic wounds in dynamic and wet environments.

The practical implementation of aqueous zinc batteries is hindered by intrinsic drawbacks of single&#8208;component systems, namely shuttling in Zn&#8208;I2 and sluggish kinetics in Zn&#9472;S. Herein, we report a Zn&#8208;S&#8208;I2 synergistic battery with a MOF&#8208;derived biphasic HES catalyst. Exhibiting excellent performance, it employs ML to predict electrochemical behavior, while operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations confirm the catalyst reduces reaction barriers and suppresses shuttling, offering new insights for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn batteries.








ABSTRACT
The practical application of aqueous zinc batteries remains constrained by the intrinsic limitations of monocomponent systems, such as the shuttle effect in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries and the sluggish kinetics in Zn&#9472;S batteries. To overcome these limitations, we developed a Zn&#8208;S&#8208;I2 synergistic battery that synergistically exploits the complementary advantages of dual redox couples. A bifunctional high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) catalyst anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets was engineered via a surfactant&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) derivatization route. The entropy&#8208;stabilized HES forms a unique wurtzite/zincblende biphasic structure, creating abundant grain boundaries and synergistic active sites. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that the synergistic battery exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance and cycling stability. Machine learning (ML) models were established to predict electrochemical behavior under various operating conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;based spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the biphasic HES synergistically catalyzes multi&#8208;step conversion reactions, simultaneously lowering energy barriers and suppressing shuttle effects. This work offers new insights into high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for complex multi&#8208;step energy storage reactions.

         <title>Fabricating High&#8208;Performance MOD&#8208;Derived YBa2Cu3O7&#8208;&#948; Layers Over 4 &#181;m via a Novel Semi&#8208;Growth Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Much thicker MOD&#8208;derived YBCO superconducting layer can be achieved by the innovative semi&#8208;growth thickening technology, and the performance of the YBCO superconducting tape has also been significantly improved. The thickness of YBCO layer exceeds 4.0 &#181;m, and Ic(77 K, self&#8208;field) can reach as high as 1150 A/12mm&#8208;w.








ABSTRACT
This study investigates an effective method for preparing high&#8208;performance YBa2Cu3O7&#8208;&#948; (YBCO)&#8208;coated conductors with thick superconducting layers using a semi&#8208;growth strategy on a metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) industrial production line. The performance results demonstrate that the semi&#8208;growth method offers considerable advantages in terms of the film growth quality and high performance owing to the systematic design of a reserved layer, compared to the performance of 2L+L/2L+2L (semi&#8208;growth) YBCO thick tapes of varying thicknesses. The 2L+2L thick films over 3.5 &#181;m achieve a critical current (Ic) of 1150 A/12&#160;mm&#8208;width (i.e., 958 A/cm&#8208;w) at 77 K@self&#8208;field, almost double that of conventional 2L (1.6 &#181;m) YBCO tapes, as well as the in&#8208;field performance at low temperature. Although the Ic performance decreases when the film thickness increases to 4.2 &#181;m in 2L+2L mode, the overall trend still demonstrates considerable potential for thick&#8208;film fabrication. High&#8208;performance YBCO tapes have been successfully scaled to the industrial production of hundreds of meters, showcasing broad application prospects and significant scientific value.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Interaction Enabled Nonlinear Metasurface Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8211;orbit interaction (SOI) enabled optical holography is demonstrated using nonlinear metasurfaces. The degrees of freedom for holographic design are enhanced by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum contributions during SOI. The encrypted information in nonlinear holographic images can be reconstructed when the fundamental waves have specific angular momentum states, enabling high&#8208;security nonlinear optical encryption with high signal purity.








ABSTRACT
Nonlinear optical metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform for efficient and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of harmonic waves, offering distinct advantages such as high&#8208;integration capability and phase&#8208;matching&#8208;free operation. Spin and orbital angular momentum (SAM and OAM) provide rich degrees of freedom for advanced light field control. While SAM&#8208; and OAM&#8208;multiplexing metasurface holograms have been realized in the linear optical regime, their performance is hindered by a low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio stemming from residual light mode conversion. Nonlinear OAM holography has recently been demonstrated; however, its practicality remains limited by reliance on bulky nonlinear optical crystals that exhibit only intrinsic spin&#8211;orbit interaction (SOI). Here, we introduce nonlinear SOI holography via second harmonic generation on optical metasurfaces composed of gold plasmonic meta&#8208;atoms. By controlling the local rotational symmetry and topological charges, these metasurface holograms can fully harness optical SOI through both intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum mode conversions. Information hidden in second harmonic holographic images can only be reconstructed from the spin&#8211;orbit tomography of the fundamental waves, ensuring high&#8208;security nonlinear optical encryption. The proposed approach offers promising applications in optical communications, optical information processing, high&#8208;dimensional optical storage, and so on.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Biomineralized Probiotic for Self&#8208;Amplifying Mucosal Vaccination: Gut&#8208;Engineered Antigen Factories Drive Targeted Cervical Tumor Regression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a generalizable oral immunotherapy platform using engineered probiotics as in vivo antigen factories. By enabling sustained, gut&#8208;localized production of tumor antigens, the platform orchestrates powerful systemic immunity that eradicates established tumors and establishes long&#8208;term protective surveillance, presenting a safe and translatable strategy against a broad spectrum of cancers.








Abstract
Therapeutic vaccines against cervical cancer critically depend on sustained high&#8208;level HPV antigen production and prolonged antigen exposure. However, suboptimal antigen bioavailability and rapid systemic clearance remain key barriers to achieving robust vaccine efficacy. Here, we engineer an oral biohybrid vaccine using pH&#8208;responsive biomineralized Bacillus subtilis (B&#8208;BS/E7@M) to establish gut&#8208;based antigen factories for sustained HPV16 E7 production. The calcium phosphate mineral coating confers gastric acid resistance (78.9% survivability vs. 9.1% uncoated) and synergizes with probiotic&#8208;mucosa interactions to prolong intestinal retention (96 h, 4 &#215; controls), enabling &gt;4&#8208;day antigen persistence and markedly enhances oral bioavailability. This system elicits coordinated immune activation: mucosal priming through germinal center expansion and APC maturation elevates IgG, IgA, and T&#8208;cell subsets&#8212;including total T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and effector memory T cells&#8212;from day 21 onward. Systemic CD8+ T&#8208;cell activation via cross&#8208;presentation enhances central and effector memory T cells, promoting tumor infiltration and resulting in 64% tumor suppression (p &lt; 0.001) with 50% complete remission in TC&#8208;1 models. Mechanistic studies pinpoint gut&#8208;orchestrated cytotoxic T cell clonal expansion as the dominant effector pathway. By bridging synthetic biology with stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials, this work pioneers a paradigm of living biotherapeutics&#8212;self&#8208;replicating, mucosa&#8208;deployable systems for precision cancer immunotherapy.

The calcium phosphate mineral coating confers gastric acid resistance (78.9% survivability vs. 9.1% uncoated) and synergizes with probiotic-mucosa interactions to prolong intestinal retention (96 h, 4 &#215; controls), enabling &amp;gt;4-day antigen persistence and markedly enhances oral bioavailability. This system elicits coordinated immune activation: mucosal priming through germinal center expansion and APC maturation elevates IgG, IgA, and T-cell subsets&#8212;including total T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and effector memory T cells&#8212;from day 21 onward. Systemic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell activation via cross-presentation enhances central and effector memory T cells, promoting tumor infiltration and resulting in 64% tumor suppression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) with 50% complete remission in TC-1 models. Mechanistic studies pinpoint gut-orchestrated cytotoxic T cell clonal expansion as the dominant effector pathway. By bridging synthetic biology with stimuli-responsive biomaterials, this work pioneers a paradigm of living biotherapeutics&#8212;self-replicating, mucosa-deployable systems for precision cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orally Administered Nanoparticle Coacervate for Therapeutic Coating of Full Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sucralfate&#8208;based Hydrophobic Integration for Enteric Lining and Nanoparticle Delivery (SHIELD) is developed as a modular oral administration platform. SHIELD coats the entire gastrointestinal tract, enabling localized retention and preservation of therapeutic nanoparticles, followed by total excretion. When incorporated with CeO2 nanoparticles, SHIELD&#8208;CeO2 demonstrates pronounced therapeutic efficacy in two distinct intestinal injury models: dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)&#8208;induced colitis and radiation&#8208;induced enteropathy.








ABSTRACT
Oral delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles offers a non&#8208;invasive approach for treating gastrointestinal diseases, but achieving localized and sustained mucosal exposure while avoiding systemic toxicity remains a major challenge. Here, a Sucralfate&#8208;based oral formulation is developed that incorporates therapeutic nanoparticles and transforms into a paste&#8208;like coacervate upon contact with intestinal fluid, uniformly coating the entire gastrointestinal tract within 6 h, and clearing through fecal transit by 12 h. Systematic investigation shows that nanoparticle hydrophobicity is essential for stable incorporation into Sucralfate&#8208;based formulation, supporting compatibility with a wide range of nanoparticle types. The incorporated nanoparticles are stabilized by strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, which limit gastric leaching and reduce cellular uptake by 0.044% compared with PEGylated nanoparticles. As a representative example, antioxidant cerium oxide nanoparticles are tested in two distinct oxidative stress&#8208;related models of intestinal injury, including immune&#8208;mediated colitis and radiation&#8208;induced enteropathy. In DSS colitis, our system reduced weight loss from 17.2% to 2.2% and restored colon structure and oxidative&#8208;stress injury. In radiation&#8208;induced enteropathy, our system attenuated weight loss from 25.5% to 11.4%, doubled villus length, and markedly enhanced epithelial regeneration. The formulation also accommodates nanoparticles with imaging capability, demonstrating versatility for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>Reversible X&#8208;Ray Memory Imaging for Cadmium&#8208;Based Perovskites: Deep Trap&#8208;Driven Radioluminescence Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible X&#8208;ray memory imaging of CsCdCl3:Pb as multi&#8208;mode stimulus response material exhibits significant advantages with reversibility, fast response, rapid erasure capability, fatigue resistance, and long&#8208;term stability, using for multi&#8208;level information encryption. Importantly, utilizing the differences in radioluminescence (RL) enhancement between extending X&#8208;ray irradiation time and turning on the X&#8208;ray tube after removing the capsules realizes the X&#8208;ray memory imaging.








ABSTRACT
X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted significant attention for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, ensuring information security under multi&#8208;level encryption scenarios remains challenges. Herein, we have developed a reversible X&#8208;ray memory imaging technique for CsCdCl3:Pb perovskite, which integrates blue emission, persistent luminescence, and photochromic behavior into four stimulus response modes, enabling the multi&#8208;level information encryption. Notably, CsCdCl3:Pb exhibits photochromic deepening, accompanied by a two&#8208;fold enhancement in radioluminescence (RL) intensity with increasing X&#8208;ray irradiation time. This enhancement originates from the formation of a new deep trap (0.79&#160;eV) that facilitates energy transfer from the color centers to the Pb2+ emission centers. Importantly, X&#8208;ray memory imaging is attributed to the differences in RL enhancement between extending X&#8208;ray irradiation time and turning on the X&#8208;ray tube after removing capsule, which is demonstrated by cycling tests and stability characterizations under different dose rates. As a result, the RL enhancement and X&#8208;ray memory imaging share common advantages: reversibility, fast response (5 s), rapid erasure capability (450&#160;nm, 10&#8211;20 s), fatigue resistance (more than 100 cycles), and long&#8208;term stability (more than half a year). This work presents an effective strategy for designing multi&#8208;mode stimulus response perovskite materials and opens a new avenue for advanced multi&#8208;level information security.

         <title>Tailoring Point Defects to Enhance Thermoelectric Performance in AgCuTe&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal and electrical transport properties of AgCuTe are effectively decoupled through targeted point defects engineering, enabling the simultaneous realization of ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity and an exceptionally high thermoelectric figure of merit. Leveraging these enhanced material properties, a fabricated segmented single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device demonstrated a peak thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion efficiency of 13.7% under a temperature gradient of 467&#160;K.








ABSTRACT
Crystalline solids with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity are essential for advancing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Superionic conductor AgCuTe exhibits inherently low lattice thermal conductivity and exceptional tunability in both electronic and phononic transport, making it a promising candidate for medium&#8208;temperature thermoelectric applications. However, its practical deployment remains limited by suboptimal performance and insufficient optimization strategies. Here, we report a substantially enhanced dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of &#8764;1.72 at 773&#160;K in p&#8208;type polycrystalline AgCuTe through a systematic point defects engineering strategy. Guided by mass and strain field fluctuation criteria for suppressing lattice thermal conductivity, sulfur is identified as an effective dopant. Subsequent introduction of cation vacancies further synergizes electronic and thermal transport, yielding a high average ZT of 1.55 between 523&#8211;773&#160;K, surpassing all previously reported values for AgCuTe. Moreover, a segmented single&#8208;leg thermoelectric module combining this material with commercial p&#8208;type (Bi, Sb)2Te3 achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;13.7% under a temperature gradient of &#8764;467&#160;K. These results underscore the efficacy of point defects engineering in optimizing superionic conductors and highlight the strong potential of AgCuTe for practical thermoelectric applications.

Low temperature co&#8208;fired ceramics (LTCC) are indispensable core materials for information communication and high&#8208;density integrated packaging, facing stringent demands in millimeter&#8208;wave and higher&#8208;frequency applications. This review highlights recent progress in optimizing the comprehensive performance of LTCC materials and targeted strategies for further enhancements, presenting new applications and future perspectives toward next generation electronics.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;fired ceramics (LTCC) with unique multilayer interconnection architectures are indispensable for electronic communication devices and high&#8208;density integrated packaging, facing stringent demands in millimeter&#8208;wave and higher&#8208;frequency applications. This review highlights recent advances in optimizing the comprehensive performance of LTCCs and proposes strategies for further enhancement to meet the ever&#8208;growing demands of high&#8208;performance microwave devices and systems. Specifically, LTCC material designs tailored to achieve desirable properties are discussed, including appropriate permittivity, low dielectric loss, a near&#8208;zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency, high thermal conductivity, matched coefficient of thermal expansion, and excellent mechanical strength. Additionally, innovations in sintering technologies are highlighted, such as ultra&#8208;low temperature co&#8208;fired ceramic (ULTCC) technology and cold sintering process (CSP). These approaches further reduce sintering temperatures, enabling LTCCs to integrate with a broader range of materials (e.g., silicon chips, aluminum electrodes, 2D materials, and polymers) that were previously incompatible with traditional high&#8208;temperature processes. Finally, this review offers insights into the future development directions of LTCCs in emerging applications, including 3D integration and advanced packaging, integrated communication and sensing systems, and millimeter&#8208;wave/terahertz integrated miniaturized devices for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>Extreme Squeezing of Volumetric Triboelectric Charge to a New Record of 224 nC cm&#8722;3 Inspired by Aesop's Fables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Aesop's fable, this work compresses harmful discharge areas by 237%, boosting surface charge density to 14.2 mC m&#8722;2 and volumetric triboelectric charge to 224 nC cm&#8722;3. It introduces a volumetric triboelectric charge metric for fair comparison. The device powers LEDs and small electronics, offering a compact, high&#8208;performance energy harvester for IoT use.








ABSTRACT
Direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerators (DC&#8208;TENGs) attract attention for their high output and low crest factor. However, inefficient spatial layouts create harmful discharge regions, causing internal charge loss. Inspired by Aesop's fable &#8220;The Crow and the Pitcher,&#8221; projection micro stereolithography integrates densely packed dual&#8208;channel charge&#8208;collecting electrodes into the slider, developing an Aesop's Fables&#8208;inspired DC&#8208;TENG (AF&#8208;TENG) based on extreme spatial compression. This design creates efficient charge&#8208;release pathways and achieves a record surface charge density of 14.2 mC m&#8722;2. To eliminate device dimension effects on performance evaluation, a novel metric, volumetric triboelectric charge, is introduced to normalize charge transport efficiency and provide a universal standard for evaluating DC&#8208;TENG designs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental optimizations enable the AF&#8208;TENG to achieve 800 V output and a record 224 nC cm&#8722;3 volumetric charge, with a fingertip&#8208;sized device lighting 32 2 W LEDs and driving hygrometers and calculators, advancing performance and establishing an evaluation system as a benchmark for future DC&#8208;TENGs.

         <title>Precise Strain Tuning of PtPdRhNi Nanozyme Boosts Multi&#8208;Pathogen and Multi&#8208;Model Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;induced lattice strain in ultrathin PtPdRh nanosheets enhances their affinity for substrates and accelerates H2O2 activation, thereby generating a large number of &#183;OH radical. This highly durable nanozyme enables broad&#8208;spectrum, multimodal antibacterial therapy, clearing pathogens in vivo and promoting infection eradication.








ABSTRACT
Nanozymes are emerging antimicrobial agents that catalyze reactive oxygen species to eliminate pathogenic threats; however, their ability to combat multidrug&#8208;resistant infections remains limited by catalytic efficiency, substrate affinity and instability. Herein, we report a new strategy incorporating Ni into ultrathin PtPdRh nanosheets to engineer lattice strain for enhancing substrate affinity and boosting enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity. The PtPdRhNi nanozyme achieves a catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km = 2.05 &#215; 106&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), 56.5&#8208;fold higher than PtPdRh and maintains over 90% activity after 15 months. Theoretical calculations reveal Ni incorporation upshifts the d&#8208;band center from &#8722;1.80 to &#8722;1.27&#160;eV and strengthens Pt&#9472;O bonding, thus accelerating the activation of H2O2 into &#183;OH. We further demonstrate that PtPdRhNi co&#8208;treated with H2O2 achieves 100% eradication of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, as well as over 99.97% killing of Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Across rat periodontitis, MRSA&#8208;infected skin wounds and deep abscess models, this catalytic platform enables rapid bacterial clearance, resolves inflammation and regenerates collagen&#8208;rich tissue. Transcriptomic analysis of MRSA exposed to PtPdRhNi with H2O2 identifies 1048 differentially expressed genes, revealing respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle shutdown, weakened antioxidant defenses, leading to energy exhaustion, oxidative damage and transcriptomic reprogramming.

         <title>Self&#8208;Swerving Optical Force by Chiral Inhomogeneity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inhomogeneous chirality/material is ubiquitously exhibited in bioparticles, chemical compounds, chiral microspheres and metasurfaces. This research proposes an intriguing effect that the chiral particle can self&#8208;swerve without switching light properties such as wavelength or polarization, which is called the &#8220;self&#8208;swerving effect.&#8221; This effect is attributed to different exotic optical lateral forces from the inhomogeneous chirality and different chiral gradients.








ABSTRACT
Light exerts optical forces on objects, finding numerous applications in physical and biomedical sciences. It is commonly known that the direction of the optical force on a single sphere is dictated by the light field. Thus, actively switching light properties such as polarization is an efficient strategy to control the locomotion of particles. Here, by exploiting the reversible optical force induced by chiral inhomogeneity, we observe self&#8208;swerving behavior in a chiral sphere embedded in water via a linearly polarized light wave. This counterintuitive optical force, arising from Poynting momentum conservation in chiral light&#8208;matter interaction, reverses direction with variations in the chirality gradient, inducing a self&#8208;swerving effect as the particle rotates. Experimentally, we observe that chiral particles, ranging from nanometers to micrometers in size, exhibit self&#8208;swerving behavior under a fixed linear polarization. Our study delves into a novel realm of optical forces in the presence of ubiquitous imperfect or inhomogeneous materials. It enriches the understanding of chiral&#8208;light interactions, and facilitates diverse applications in chiral detection, advanced optical manipulation, and micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Phase Synergy Enables Low&#8208;Power Ferroelectric Switching in HfO2 Epitaxial Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how the phase synergy between orthorhombic and tetragonal polymorphs enables low&#8208;power ferroelectric switching in La&#8208;doped HfO2 epitaxial films. Atomic&#8208;scale microscopy and deep&#8208;learning molecular dynamics show that coherent O&#8211;T boundaries create intermediate states that lower the switching barrier, establishing synergistic phase engineering as a powerful route to high&#8208;performance hafnia ferroelectrics.








ABSTRACT
HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have emerged as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation non&#8208;volatile memory technologies, owing to their nanoscale robust ferroelectricity and complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. However, challenges and debates persist in advancing and comprehensively understanding their ferroelectric behavior. In particular, conventional approaches typically regard non&#8208;ferroelectric phases as detrimental and primarily focus on suppressing their formation, yet overlooking their potentially synergistic contributions&#8212;particularly those of the tetragonal (T) phase. Here, we unambiguously clarify the beneficial role of the T&#8208;phase and introduce a phase&#8208;boundary engineering strategy that deliberately harnesses it to enhance ferroelectricity in HfO2 films. By stabilizing optimal coherent boundaries between ferroelectric orthorhombic (O) and T phases in epitaxial La&#8208;doped HfO2 films, we achieve significant improvements in ferroelectric properties&#8212;doubling the remanent polarization (Pr &#8764; 30 &#181;C/cm2) and substantially reducing the coercive field (Ec &#8764; 3 MV/cm) by 30% compared to low&#8208;La doped samples without such boundaries. Atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy reveals the structural nature of the atomically sharp, coherent O&#8211;T boundaries. Combined with deep&#8208;learning enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, our results unravel that these boundaries facilitate intermediate polarization states that lower the switching energy barrier. Consequently, phase coexistence shifts from an inherent drawback to a tunable design element, offering a broadly applicable route to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power HfO2&#8208;based nanoelectronics.

         <title>Magnetoelectric Coupling Stimulation Modulates Macrophage Reprogramming for Superior Infected Periodontal Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectric CFO&#8208;BFO NPs are synthesized for periodontitis therapy. Under magnetic stimulation, CFO&#8208;BFO NPs enhance osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs and exhibit potent antibacterial activity. For immunomodulatory mechanisms, magnetoelectric CFO&#8208;BFO NPs promote osteogenesis through modulating macrophage reprogramming via the PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathway. This study integrates antibacterial activity, immunomodulation, and bone regeneration, providing a valuable candidate for periodontitis treatment.








ABSTRACT
Clinical management of periodontitis requires addressing both bacterial infection and the deficient osteogenic microenvironment to optimize tissue regeneration. Electroactive biomaterials have demonstrated promise in bone regeneration, but are insufficient to enduringly synergize antibacterial properties with optimal immunomodulatory and tissue remodeling effects within the complex inflammatory microenvironment. Here, this study proposes an efficient, dynamic magnetoelectric conversion&#8208;based therapeutic strategy, which integrates antibacterial activity and immunomodulation to optimize periodontal tissue regeneration. Magnetic field&#8208;sensitive CoFe2O4&#8208;BiFeO3 nanoparticles (CFO&#8208;BFO NPs) are developed as a pioneering magnetoelectric biomaterial for periodontitis therapy. Magnetoelectric CFO&#8208;BFO NPs significantly enhance osteogenesis of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and exhibit potent antibacterial activity in vitro. Crucially, magnetoelectric coupling stimulation can program macrophage from the M1 to M2 phenotype via the PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathway, thereby enhancing osteogenesis. Moreover, magnetoelectric CFO&#8208;BFO NPs can also alleviate tissue inflammation and accelerate infected periodontal bone regeneration in Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis)&#8208;mediated periodontitis mice models. After 4 weeks of treatment, the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the magnetoelectric CFO&#8208;BFO NPs group approached healthy levels. This study pioneers the application of magnetoelectric coupling materials for periodontitis treatment and provides a novel strategy for enhancing the therapeutic effects of electroactive biomaterials on periodontitis.

&lt;p&gt;Magnetoelectric CFO-BFO NPs are synthesized for periodontitis therapy. Under magnetic stimulation, CFO-BFO NPs enhance osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs and exhibit potent antibacterial activity. For immunomodulatory mechanisms, magnetoelectric CFO-BFO NPs promote osteogenesis through modulating macrophage reprogramming via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This study integrates antibacterial activity, immunomodulation, and bone regeneration, providing a valuable candidate for periodontitis treatment.

         <title>Poly(Citric Acid) Bidirectional Regulator: Coordinating Iron Homeostasis to Suppress Stress Responses and Boosting Mitochondrial Bioenergetics for Enhanced Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral nerve repair is clinically challenging due to a complex regenerative microenvironment involving iron dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress, and inadequate vascular remodeling. A PCA&#8208;loaded Gel&#8208;LA microgel hydrogel/electrospun fiber conduit regulates this microenvironment via Fe2&#8314; chelation, alleviates mitochondrial/ER stress, boosts energy metabolism/vascularization, and guides axonal alignment, supporting nerve regeneration.








ABSTRACT
Due to the complex regenerative microenvironment, peripheral nerve repair poses significant challenges in clinical treatment. Severe injuries can lead to dysregulated iron homeostasis, and excessive iron produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction. The subsequent oxidative stress further leads to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which impedes nerve regeneration. In addition, insufficient vascular remodeling also limits the repair of damaged nerves. Herein, a poly(citric acid) (PCA)&#8208;loaded gelatin&#8208;lipoic acid (Gel&#8208;LA) microgel hydrogel&#8208;filled oriented electrospun fiber conduit was developed, which guides axonal alignment by topographical cues, promotes cellular infiltration and nutrient transport through a microgel cascade pore structure, and regulates the regenerative microenvironment via the ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation effect of PCA. The results demonstrate that this conduit effectively reduces the levels of Fe2+ at the injury site, thereby alleviating mitochondrial and ER stress while promoting energy metabolism, vascular reconstruction, and nerve regeneration. This study highlights the potential of PCA in modulating the microenvironment of nerve injuries and provides new insights for developing tissue&#8208;engineered scaffolds.

         <title>Construction of Zeolite&#8208;Type Metal Sulfide &#8220;Ion Sieve&#8221; Into Electrospun Membranes for Ultrafast and Selective 137Cs+ Sequestration</title>

Presented is an effective strategy for Cs+ sequestration by constructing zeolite&#8208;type metal sulfide GaGeS&#8208;1 as a &#8220;Cs+ ion sieve&#8221;. GaGeS&#8208;1 demonstrates distinct &#8220;Cs+ ion&#8208;sieving&#8221; behavior, exhibiting high capacity, ultrafast kinetics, and excellent selectivity for Cs+ adsorption. The &#8220;ion&#8208;sieving&#8221; effect originates from ion exchange, strong Cs+&#183;&#183;&#183;S2&#8722; interaction, and flexible&#8208;robust framework.

Abstract
Selective 137Cs+ sequestration is challenging due to its high solubility, environmental mobility, and the influence of excessive competitive ions. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy for Cs+ separation by constructing zeolite&#8208;type metal sulfide as &#8220;cesium ion sieve&#8221; (CIS), obtaining GaGeS&#8208;1 with &#8220;ion&#8208;sieving effect&#8221;. Its structure features a zeolite&#8208;type metal sulfide framework with sodalite (SOD) topology based on supertetrahedral T2 clusters. GaGeS&#8208;1 with radiation resistance possesses a maximum Cs+ adsorption capacity of 332.52&#160;mg/g and ultrafast adsorption kinetics with removal rate (RCs) of 97.06% within 1.5 min. It achieves highly selective Cs+ capture under excessive competing ions, even for actual industrial 137Cs&#8314;&#8208;liquid&#8208;waste (RCs &gt; 90%). Single crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculation reveal that &#8220;ion&#8208;sieving&#8221; originates from strong Cs+&#183;&#183;&#183;S2&#8722; interaction, flexible&#8208;robust framework, and optimal Cs+ coordination in SOD cage. Furthermore, GaGeS&#8208;1 is integrated with gelatin to fabricate GaGeS&#8208;1/Gel nanofibrous electrospun membranes for a multi&#8208;stage filtration system, enabling efficient, continuous, and recyclable treatment of mixed Na/Cs wastewater (3.58 L/m2, RCs = 99.39%) and Cs+&#8208;contaminated river water (2.63 L/m2, RCs = 99.23%). This study pioneers an efficient &#8220;CIS&#8221; by developing zeolite&#8208;type metal sulfide, and provides a universal assembly method toward practical application, opening new insight into radiocesium remediation and advanced nuclear waste management.

         <title>Conductive Cation Traps for Synthesizing Efficient and Stable Perovskite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a conductive SrMoO4&#8208;based cation trapping strategy for solid oxide CO2 electrolysis. By thermodynamically stabilizing Sr2+ through in situ transformation into electronically conductive SrMoO3 (up to 30&#215; conductivity enhancement), the design suppresses SrCO3 segregation and enriches surface oxygen vacancies. The SPG&#8208;19 achieves 3 A cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.57&#160;V with 62% energy efficiency and 90% degradation mitigation.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite oxides are promising material candidates for many important catalytic and energy conversion processes. Strontium doping at the A sites of perovskite oxides can potentially enhance their performance in these applications. However, the segregation of Sr2+ to form inert phases, driven by its enrichment on surfaces, renders perovskite oxide materials unstable and inefficient during long&#8208;term operation. Here, we design a Sr2+ cation trap by introducing SrMoO4 during cell fabrication, which partially transforms into conductive SrMoO3 under reducing conditions. In the scenario of the high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction reaction (HT&#8208;CO2RR), this conductive cation trap effectively prevents Sr2+ segregation in electrochemically inert SrCO3 phases, concurrently enhancing electrode conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. As a result, we demonstrate, using catalysts consisting of Pr0.90Sr0.10Co0.95Cu0.05O3&#8208;&#948; and 19 wt.% SrMoO4, a one&#8208;order&#8208;magnitude reduction of degradation rate compared to the case without cation trapping. We report a current density of 3 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.57&#160;V, along with near&#8208;unity Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for CO, energy efficiencies (EEs) exceeding 70%, and stable operation for over 160 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2 without degradation.

A novel inorganic cobalt&#8208;bridged polyoxoniobate framework (Co&#8208;PONbs) featuring a 3D topological network is constructed via coordinative linkage of {PNb12O40} clusters. This unique architecture creates asymmetric dual&#8208;active sites that drive efficient polysulfide conversion through a cooperative electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. When applied in a polysulfide&#8208;iodine redox flow battery, it enables an unprecedented cycling stability with 99.96% capacity retention over 1500 cycles at 60 mA cm&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we report for the first time a cobalt&#8208;bridged polyoxoniobate framework (Co&#8208;PONbs) featuring a 3D coordination architecture, constructed by linking {PNb12O40} clusters through the coordinatively versatile Co2+ ions. This unique inorganic framework exhibits exceptional stability in strongly alkaline electrolytes, helping to address the challenge of catalyst degradation under operating conditions. Acting as an efficient electrocatalyst, Co&#8208;PONbs significantly enhances the redox conversion kinetics of polysulfides in redox flow batteries. Electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the preferential adsorption of polysulfides on Co&#8208;PONbs/SP&#8208;modified electrodes. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that embedding cobalt centers in {PNb12O40} clusters generates asymmetric dual&#8208;active sites. This unique configuration drives S&#9472;S bond cleavage in S42&#8722; via a cooperative electron&#8208;transfer mechanism, kinetically promoting conversion to S22&#8722; intermediates. When implemented in aqueous polysulfide&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries, the Co&#8208;PONbs/SP composite&#8208;modified carbon felt cathode sustains remarkable energy efficiency (82.7%) and Coulombic efficiency (99.5%) over 530 h of continuous operation. The system demonstrates unprecedented cycling stability with 99.96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conductor Multiscale Nanoconfinement Overcomes Ion&#8208;Transport Limitations in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

We pioneer a fast&#8208;ion&#8208;conductor multiscale nanoconfinement strategy by incorporating first&#8208;ever&#8208;synthesized, PEG&#8208;confined boron&#8208;rich COF nanotubes into a PEO matrix. This approach establishes continuous high&#8208;throughput Na+ migration while simultaneously weakening the Na+ coordination environment. Consequently, the resulting composite polymer electrolyte achieves a breakthrough ionic conductivity of 1.99 mS cm&#8722;1 at 60&#176;C, enabling ultra&#8208;stable operation of high&#8208;loading all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells at near&#8208;ambient conditions.








ABSTRACT
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) hold significant potential for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries, yet their development remains hindered by compromised ionic transport kinetics arising from limited conduction pathways and strong Na+ coordination. Here, we report a fast&#8208;ion&#8208;conductor multiscale nanoconfinement strategy that enables continuous high&#8208;throughput Na+ migration in CPEs by embedding polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;confined boron&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (BCOF) nanotubes into a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix. Size&#8208;compatible PEG oligomers as fast&#8208;ion&#8208;conductors are effectively confined within the well&#8208;defined nanopores/tunnels of BCOF nanotube via Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, creating interconnected Na+ migration pathways. Simultaneously, the intermolecular interactions between Lewis&#8208;acidic boron sites in BCOF and oxygen atoms in PEO/PEG weaken Na+&#9472;O coordination strength, further boosting Na+ transport kinetics. This pioneering design allows the constructed CPEs to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity of up to 1.99 mS cm&#8722;1 at 60&#176;C and 0.36 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30&#176;C, with a high Na+ transference number of 0.89. As such, the Na/Na symmetric cell delivers stable Na plating/stripping over 3200&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;loading all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90.7 % capacity retention over 800 cycles at 1 C and near&#8208;ambient conditions. This study emphasizes the significant impact of multiscale nanoconfinement chemistry on the advancement of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>La&#8208;Doped Mullite Bi2Fe4O9 Chemiresistive Gas Sensor for Ultra&#8208;Highly Selective Detection of Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La&#8208;doped mullite Bi2Fe4O9 with abundant oxygen vacancies was facilely synthesized, affording exceptional selectivity to ethylene glycol (EG) vapor. The surface oxidation mechanism of EG on La&#8208;doped Bi2Fe4O9 was elucidated, and a wearable sensing platform was developed, with machine learning enhancing gas recognition accuracy.








ABSTRACT
The detection of ethylene glycol (EG) vapor is critical for industrial safety and environmental monitoring, yet existing chemiresistive sensors suffer from limited selectivity and stability. Herein, a facile synthesis of lanthanum&#8208;doped mullite bismuth ferrite mullite (La&#8208;Bi2Fe4O9) is presented. Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and microchemical analysis, in combination with theoretical calculations, confirm uniform Bi&#8208;site doping, increased&#160;oxygen vacancy concentration, and enhanced gas adsorption. The optimized BLFO&#8208;5 sensor demonstrates exceptional EG&#8208;sensing performance,&#160;with&#160;ultrahigh selectivity, outstanding reproducibility and long&#8208;term stability, and an ultralow detection limit. By integrating in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the EG surface oxidization reaction mechanism, revealing significantly enhanced dehydrogenation kinetics and a complete oxidation pathway. Moreover, we develop a wearable real&#8208;time gas monitoring platform for practical validation and incorporate deep learning algorithms to improve gas recognition accuracy. This work presents an integrated strategy for chemical gas sensing that combines material defect engineering, mechanistic understanding, and functional device development, enabling wireless EG quantification in complex environments.

         <title>Suppressing Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Cathodic Salt Crystallization for Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work unveils an overlooked failure mechanism in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries: electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced catastrophic interfacial salt crystallization (CISC). We effectively suppress CISC by introducing sulfolane to disrupt interfacial ion ordering and raise the crystallization barrier. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design enables exceptional long&#8208;life performance, achieving 20&#160;000 stable cycles at &#8211;20&#160;&#176;C with negligible capacity decay.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) hold promise for sustainable energy storage but suffer rapid capacity decay, particularly at subzero conditions. Beyond cathode instability and side reactions, we unveil an interfacial failure pathway: electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase separation that triggers catastrophic interfacial salt crystallization (CISC). The insulating crystalline layer rapidly engulfs the cathode, precipitating accelerated degradation. Mechanistic studies pinpoint solvent depletion and anion enrichment within the electric double layer as the origin of CISC. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental observations demonstrate that sulfolane (TS) disrupts interfacial ion ordering, elevates the crystallization barrier, and thereby effectively suppresses CICS. This strategy stabilizes the cathode structure, enhances zinc availability, facilitates the V2O5 activation phase transition, increases the Zn2+ transference number, and promotes uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, V2O5||Zn batteries display remarkable stability, retaining 378.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at room temperature and sustaining nearly invariant capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C. These findings expose interfacial salt crystallization as a critical failure pathway in AZIBs and provide a molecular&#8208;level design strategy for electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Personal Thermoregulation by Heat&#8208;Conducting Engineered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article covers personal thermal management textiles. It begins with mechanistic models for predicting thermal conductivity of composites, reviews advance in single&#8208;function (warming/cooling) and bifunctional (switchable) textile design, analyzes key scientific challenges for practical application, and concludes with an outlook on future developments and emerging applications of personal thermal management technology.








ABSTRACT
Personal thermal management (PTM) is a technique leveraging advanced textile design to control the heat exchange between the human body and the external environment, thereby regulating microenvironments surrounding individuals and ensuring optimal thermal comfort. Critical to the PTM is heat conductivity, which serves as the primary mode of thermal transfer in textiles. Various materials with engineered thermal conductivities have been developed and incorporated into textiles for modulating warming and cooling effects toward achieving the optimal thermal comfort.

&lt;p&gt;This article covers personal thermal management textiles. It begins with mechanistic models for predicting thermal conductivity of composites, reviews advance in single-function (warming/cooling) and bifunctional (switchable) textile design, analyzes key scientific challenges for practical application, and concludes with an outlook on future developments and emerging applications of personal thermal management technology.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal thermal management (PTM) is a technique leveraging advanced textile design to control the heat exchange between the human body and the external environment, thereby regulating microenvironments surrounding individuals and ensuring optimal thermal comfort. Critical to the PTM is heat conductivity, which serves as the primary mode of thermal transfer in textiles. Various materials with engineered thermal conductivities have been developed and incorporated into textiles for modulating warming and cooling effects toward achieving the optimal thermal comfort. However, the performance of reported textiles remains far from being satisfactory to meet the needs of daily use, especially in terms of heat management, wearability, and operational stability. Here, we first introduce mechanistic models for predicting the textiles&#8217; thermal conductivity. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the design and realization of both single-function textiles (warming or cooling) and bifunctional textiles (switchable warming and cooling) based on mechanical force and various stimuli-responsive materials. We also analyze the major scientific and technological challenges for materializing the potential of textiles into practical applications in the PTM. Finally, an outlook is made on the future developments of the heat-conducting textiles and on the emerging applications of PTM technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Polymerized Polysiloxane Enables Cohesive Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Practical Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cohesion solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed to enhance SEI mechanical stability. In situ formed polysiloxane glues the inorganic nanoparticles of SEI. This glued SEI has an elastic modulus 2.1 times as high as that of the routine SEI. Li&#8208;metal pouch cell with glued SEI exhibits both high energy density and high discharge power density.








ABSTRACT
The mechanical instability of nanostructured solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes severely limits the cycle life of Li&#8208;metal batteries because SEI undergoes endless cracking and regeneration due to anode volume fluctuations. Here, a cohesive SEI nanostructure is proposed to enhance SEI mechanical stability. The inorganic nanoparticles with weak interparticle cohesion in SEI are glued using polysiloxane, in situ formed from hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (CTS) as an electrolyte additive. This approach strengthens interparticle cohesion of inorganic components, and the elastic modulus of SEI increases by 109%, significantly improving its tolerance to anode volume fluctuations. As a result, Li&#8208;metal coin cells with glued SEI exhibit an extended cycle life of 320 cycles, compared with 183 cycles with routine SEI, under practical conditions. Furthermore, a prototype 505&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8208;metal pouch cell with glued SEI achieves 175 cycles. Specifically, the pouch cell with glued SEI exhibits superior high&#8208;rate discharge capabilities, as demonstrated by its capacity to power a micro&#8208;unmanned aerial vehicle, advancing Li&#8208;metal batteries towards practical applications. This work presents a generalizable strategy to in situ reinforcement of SEI for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Tailorable Polarity Switching and Optoelectronic Transition in a Gate&#8208;Source Integrated 2D Ferroelectric Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a gate&#8208;source integrated ferroelectric phototransistor in which the gate electrode is merged with the source electrode. This design ensures effective gate modulation of the carrier&#8208;transport characteristics while applying a channel voltage, thus facilitating the integration and multifunctionality of the devices.









ABSTRACT
2D ferroelectric phototransistors are innovative devices capable of regulating the optoelectronic characteristics of channel materials through ferroelectric polarization, demonstrating immense potential in photodetection, optical storage, and optical communication. Herein, we present a novel 2D ferroelectric phototransistor structure&#8212;Au/WSe2/CuCrP2S6/graphene&#8212;featuring an integrated gate&#8211;source electrode. By applying only the channel voltage, the major carrier type can be switched, and the optoelectronic performance is significantly enriched. Specifically, the structure enables positive/negative photoconduction switching at a low channel voltage of only 0.75&#160;V, around which an optoelectronic transition occurs because of the ion migration. The optoelectronic transition manifests as a variation up to three orders of magnitude in the photocurrent decay time driven by the capture and release of photogenerated holes by Cu&#8208;ion vacancies, as well as positive and negative photoconduction switching triggered by different laser pulse intervals. This novel architecture offers an integrated platform that harnesses the distinctive characteristics of 2D ferroelectrics to dynamically and precisely tune the optoelectronic properties of 2D semiconductors.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Dual&#8208;Functional Hydrogels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Rapid Kinetics and Ultrahigh Water Uptake for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research is the first to apply a 4D&#8208;printed stimuli&#8208;responsive structure to atmospheric water harvesting systems, where dynamic structural changes overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional static sorbent materials. 4D&#8208;printed hydrogel successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between rapid adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics and ultra&#8208;high water uptake, setting a model for the next generation of hygroscopic materials.








ABSTRACT
Sorption&#8208;based Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) is an innovative approach to mitigate global freshwater scarcity. However, there is a trade&#8208;off between rapid kinetics and ultrahigh water uptake, which is a formidable challenge in designing sorbent materials. Herein, 4D printed dual&#8208;functional hydrogel is constructed through the collaborative design of molecular&#8208;scale dynamic response network and macro&#8208;scale structure. The 4D dual&#8208;functional hydrogel integrates thermoresponsive (PNIPAM) and zwitterionic (PDMPAS) to form dynamic response networks, and is loaded with polypyrrole (PPY) and lithium chloride (4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl). Simultaneously, 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl utilizes an abundant air&#8208;sorbent interface to accelerate moisture absorption kinetics, exhibiting a large swelling ratio under humidity stimulation to capture more water. The moisture absorption rate and water uptake of 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl are double those of bulk TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl between 30% and 90% RH, exhibiting an ultrahigh water uptake of 1.62&#8211;6.85&#160;g g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbents. In addition, the excellent photothermal conversion of 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl induces a&#160;hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition&#160;and&#160;structural shrinkage under one&#8208;sun illumination,&#160;facilitating&#160;rapid water release. Furthermore, 4D TZG&#8208;PPY&#8208;LiCl AWH device has been further constructed, enabling continuous freshwater production. This breakthrough provides a new idea for the development of sorbent materials.

         <title>Maximized Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Metal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color CPL with the max glum of &#8722;1.68 is achieved from atomically precise metal clusters in the bilayer device, the highest among metal cluster materials. In the device, PMMA integration enhances the luminescence efficiency of metal clusters while maintaining CLCs&#8217; optics. The devices demonstrate their application in photoinduced enantioselective polymerization, realizing light&#8208;to&#8208;matter chiral transfer.








ABSTRACT
Colorful circularly polarized luminescence materials with large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) are desired for 3D display, asymmetric synthesis, and encryption. However, realizing such materials based on metal clusters faces significant hurdles. Here, we disclose full&#8208;color CPL (visible light to near&#8208;infrared) with the maximum glum factor up to &#8722;1.68 from atomically precise metal clusters in bilayer architectures, composed of soft helix chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) layers and metal cluster layers. This glum factor is the highest value reported among all metal cluster&#8208;based materials. In the bilayer architecture device, the luminescence efficiency and stability of the metal clusters are significantly enhanced by their integration into the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in the bilayer device, all while perfectly maintaining the optical properties of CLCs. Then, we further demonstrated the application of the metal cluster's excellent full&#8208;color CPL in photoinduced enantioselective polymerization, realizing a chiral transfer from light to matter. This work contributes to the design and synthesis of highly efficient full&#8208;spectrum chiroptical metal cluster materials, as well as the expansion of the application of photoinduced enantioselective polymerization technologies.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Solvents for Thermally Switchable Ion Conduction in Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogels containing salts dissolved in phase&#8208;change solvents exhibit thermally switchable ion conduction. The organogels, which display an over 10&#160;000&#8208;fold on&#8208;off ratio and high cycling stability, can be synthesized with a wide range of salts and customizable conductivity/temperature relations for applications in ionotronics and energy storage. Demonstrations as both digital thermal switches and analog temperature sensors highlight the scheme's versatility.








ABSTRACT
Conductive media in which ions carry charge through a solution are foundationally important to batteries, supercapacitors, and ionotronic devices. Shifts in ion mobility imposed by physical changes in the solution can dynamically impact the conductivity of the medium. This paper reports a class of temperature&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;change organogels in which a polymer network is formed within salt solutions in organic solvents with melting points between room temperature and 100 &#176;C. The conductivity in the molten state (up to &#8764;10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;S/cm) exceeded that in the frozen state by over 10&#160;000&#8208;fold and remained stable after holding at 90 &#176;C for 3 h or over 100 freezing/melting cycles. A diverse range of salts can be used, and the conductivity/temperature relationship can be tuned by selecting or mixing solvents with different melting points. Depending on the solvent composition, these phase&#8208;change organogels can either produce approximately digital (binary) thermal responses to function as switches or respond continuously as analog temperature sensors or other transducers. An advantage of this strategy over prior literature is that the identity of the charge carrier and the phase behavior of the solvent can be tuned independently, presenting a wide design space for electrolyte materials whose conductivity responds to temperature.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Powered Probiotics Reconfigure the Intestinal Niche via Biofilm Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A niche reconfiguration&#8208;driven strategy for probiotics&#8217; colonization enhancement is introduced. This therapy involves the coordination&#8208;driven modification of the Des&#8208;antagonistic probiotic Lactobacillus strain, designated Ca2+/KAE@Lap, using Ca2+ and KAE, a natural calcium&#8208;modulating component. By specifically targeting the tripartite causes of colonization resistance mediated by Desulfovibrio biofilms, Ca2+/KAE@Lap ensures calcium&#8208;bridged interfacial binding for enhanced elimination of pathogen and calcium&#8208;restored mucoprotein regeneration for mucus layer remodeling. The Ca2+/KAE@Lap therapeutic intervention drives biofilm composition from Desulfovibrio&#8208;dominated to Lactobacillus&#8208;enriched consortia, concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state.








ABSTRACT
Excessive Desulfovibrio (Des) forms biofilm to enable dominant occupation of the intestinal niche, representing a common pathogenic driver of multiple inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types. Colonization resistance constitutes the primary barrier to antagonistic probiotic efficacy, and this is driven by the pathogen&#8208;favorable microenvironment established by Des. Here, probiotic Lactiplantibacillus (Lap) is modified by calcium ions (Ca2+) and calcium&#8208;regulative polyphenol (kaempferol&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;rutinoside, KAE) via coordinate interaction to achieve intestinal niche reconfiguration. Targeting the tripartite mechanisms of Des&#8208;mediated colonization resistance, the Ca2+/KAE@Lap platform optimized niche competition through Ca2+&#8208;bridged interfacial binding with directional bactericidal activity, and this enables bacterial replacement at occupied sites. Ca2+/KAE@Lap reestablishes calcium homeostasis disrupted by Des via synergistic Ca2+/KAE regulation, dually restoring epithelial energy metabolism and mucus layer reconstitution, counteracting Des&#8208;induced colonized sites contraction and regenerated site impairment. This drives phenotypic shift in biofilm composition from Des&#8208;dominated to Lap&#8208;enriched consortia, which is concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state. This calcium&#8208;based biofilm transformation strategy overcomes the transient colonization limitation inherent in conventional probiotic therapies by effectively disrupting colonization resistance in IBD treatment.

Organic Electrochemical Random&#8208;Access Memory (OECRAM) bridges biology and electronics. This review outlines its mechanisms, key parameters, material advances, and challenges, while envisioning bio&#8208;integrated applications across scales.








ABSTRACT
Organic electrochemical random&#8208;access memory (OECRAM) has emerged as a promising neuromorphic device by mimicking the ion&#8208;modulated synaptic plasticity of biological systems. Leveraging organic semiconductors and ionic conductors, OECRAMs share key features with biological synapses, including a wet operating environment, organic composition, low&#8208;voltage operation, intrinsic flexibility, and multimodal sensing&#8208;memory capabilities. These features break the constraint of traditional in&#8208;memory computing architecture, enabling the seamless integration of OECRAMs with the biological nerve system for neural repair, biohybrid interfaces, and wearable healthcare. Recent advances in material, device, and system design have unlocked the future applications of OECRAMs as a bio&#8208;integrated hardware. This review highlights fundamental mechanisms, device parameters, and their determining factors, material innovations, main challenges, and application frontiers. Finally, three key opportunities for OECRAMs are raised, including implantable artificial nerves for neural functions restoration, bioelectronic hybrid synapses for specific sensing, and multimodal edge&#8208;computing systems for real&#8208;time disease diagnosis. These application scenarios outline the future directions to transition bio&#8208;integrated OECRAMs from laboratory prototypes to clinical and industrial realities.

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes&#8208;Enabled ROS Catalysis and Metal Transport Regulation Cooperatively Induce Ferroptosis to Treat Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Fe&#8208;NSC) are constructed to combat drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by disrupting redox homeostasis and regulating metal transport proteins (MTP). The D&#8208;enantiomer (DFe&#8208;NSC) exhibits stronger enzyme&#8208;like activity, induces ROS generation and intracellular Fe2&#8314; accumulation. This &#8220;chiral catalysis&#8211;MTP regulation&#8221; strategy synergistically triggers ferroptosis&#8208;like death in drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








ABSTRACT
Nanozyme&#8208;driven ferroptosis provides a promising therapeutic strategy against drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections by inducing iron overload and oxidative stress. However, bacterial metal transport proteins (MTP) and antioxidant systems can reduce iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, limiting the efficacy of ferroptosis&#8208;based therapies and promoting resistance. Single&#8208;atom and chiral nanozymes, with their high atomic utilization and catalytic specificity, may provide an effective approach to overcoming bacterial defense mechanisms, which has been not exploited. In this study, we report D&#8208;chiral single&#8208;atom iron&#8211;carbon dot nanozymes (DFe&#8208;NSC) for effective bacterial infection treatment. Compared to L&#8208;chiral form (LFe&#8208;NSC), DFe&#8208;NSC exhibits significantly higher peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activities. The enhanced catalytic activity promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione depletion, disrupting bacterial redox homeostasis. More intriguingly, DFe&#8208;NSC more effectively modulates the expression and iron&#8208;regulatory function of MTP (including Fur and FtnA) than LFe&#8208;NSC. This will induce substantial accumulation of Fe2&#8314; intracellularly and thereafter lipid peroxidation, thereby facilitating the bactericidal effects of ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. Resultantly, DFe&#8208;NSC exhibit markedly enhanced antibacterial and antibiofilm activities in diabetic infected wound and osteomyelitis models. This study introduces a chiral catalysis&#8211;MTP regulation strategy to induce bacterial ferroptosis&#8208;like death, providing a promising alternative for drug&#8208;resistant infection treatment.

         <title>Recent Advances in Collective Behaviors of Micro/Nanomotor Swarms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the driving forces behind collective motion, explores the self&#8208;organization of micro/nano swarms across zero&#8208;dimensional (0D), one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;spaces, and highlights their potential in drug delivery, environmental monitoring, and smart devices. It offers insights and perspectives to support future developments and new opportunities in swarm&#8208;based technologies.








ABSTRACT
Collective motion, exemplified by swarming insects, flocking birds, and bacterial colonies, emerges from the synchronized actions and velocity adjustments of individual units. Inspired by these natural phenomena, researchers have sought to replicate and harness collective behavior in swarms of self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors. This endeavor is of great importance for the development of multicomponent adaptive systems. Comprising numerous interacting elements, collective swarms exhibit emergent behaviors that capitalize on multi&#8208;motor cooperation, enabling highly efficient, flexible, and robust group performance. Understanding and engineering these behaviors are essential for translating them into practical applications. This review examines the driving forces underlying collective motion, outlines various modes of swarm formation across different dimensions, and highlights representative applications.

     alt="Recent Advances in Collective Behaviors of Micro/Nanomotor Swarms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review describes the driving forces behind collective motion, explores the self-organization of micro/nano swarms across zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D)&#160;spaces, and highlights their potential in drug delivery, environmental monitoring, and smart devices. It offers insights and perspectives to support future developments and new opportunities in swarm-based technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collective motion, exemplified by swarming insects, flocking birds, and bacterial colonies, emerges from the synchronized actions and velocity adjustments of individual units. Inspired by these natural phenomena, researchers have sought to replicate and harness collective behavior in swarms of self-propelled micro/nanomotors. This endeavor is of great importance for the development of multicomponent adaptive systems. Comprising numerous interacting elements, collective swarms exhibit emergent behaviors that capitalize on multi-motor cooperation, enabling highly efficient, flexible, and robust group performance. Understanding and engineering these behaviors are essential for translating them into practical applications. This review examines the driving forces underlying collective motion, outlines various modes of swarm formation across different dimensions, and highlights representative applications. By linking driving forces, system dimensionality, and functional implementation, it provides a comprehensive perspective on this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rotational Multimaterial 3D Printing of Soft Robotic Matter With Embedded Asymmetrical Pneumatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft elastomers with embedded, asymmetric channels are created by rotational multimaterial 3D printing. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths for fabricating complex designs, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build programmable soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.








ABSTRACT
The rapid design and fabrication of soft robotic matter is of growing interest for shape morphing, actuation, and wearable devices. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for creating soft robotic materials with embedded pneumatics that exhibit programmable shape morphing behavior. Using rotational multimaterial 3D printing, asymmetrical core&#8211;shell filaments composed of elastomeric shells and fugitive channels are patterned in 1D, 2D, and 2.5D motifs. By precisely controlling the nozzle design, rotation rate, extrusion rate, and print path, one can control the local orientation, shape, and cross&#8208;sectional area of the patterned fugitive channel along each printed filament. Once the elastomeric matrix is cured, the fugitive ink is removed, leaving behind embedded channels that facilitate pneumatic actuation. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths required for more complex soft robots, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.

         <title>Dislocation&#8208;Enhanced Pyroelectricity in Barium Titanate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a dislocation engineering strategy to enhance the pyroelectric properties of BaTiO3 single crystals, where high&#8208;temperature plastic deformation creates anisotropic dislocation networks that modulate domain&#8208;wall stability and motion. This approach establishes the coupling of dislocations with domain walls as an effective route for tuning pyroelectric functionality through microstructural design.








ABSTRACT
Pyroelectric materials hold significant promise for thermal sensing, imaging, and energy harvesting, with the pyroelectric coefficient serving as the key figure of merit. While intrinsic lattice optimization, particularly through zero&#8208;dimensional point defects, has improved pyroelectric properties, extrinsic contributions from mobile ferroelectric domain walls have remained underexplored. Here, a dislocation&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional mechanical doping strategy is proposed to enhance the pyroelectric response of classical ferroelectric BaTiO3 single crystals. By employing high&#8208;temperature plastic deformation, anisotropic dislocation networks are produced that introduce localized stress concentrations and thermal expansion/contraction effects, which amplify domain&#8208;wall motion. These directional strain fields, combined with phonon&#8211;dislocation interactions, lead to an anisotropic coupling of thermal and electrical fields. While the enhanced phonon scattering reduces thermal conductivity, the strong dislocation&#8211;domain&#8208;wall coupling leads to an increase in the temperature sensitivity of polarization and accelerates domain switching, effectively compensating for the reduced heat transport. As a result, the maximum pyroelectric coefficient exceeds 600&#160;nC&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;1, representing a 38&#8208;fold increase compared to the undeformed counterpart. Structural evolution is revealed by synchrotron scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, while multiscale phase&#8208;field simulations corroborate the underlying mechanism. Our work establishes dislocation engineering as an effective new pathway towards domain&#8208;wall&#8208;mediated enhancement of pyroelectric functionality.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Nanofiber&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Energy Harvesting and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional molecular strategy optimizes the tribonegative layer by electrospinning PVDF&#8208;HFP for dipole alignment and crystallinity, followed by 2D borophene doping to enhance conductivity and charge trapping. Integrated with Nylon&#8208;66 nanofibers, the composite device delivers a record sensitivity of 53.8 &#177; 1.2 V kPa&#8722;1 at 3 Hz, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive sensing for advanced wearable and biomedical applications.








ABSTRACT
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) represents a major advancement in capability for self&#8208;powered sensors, with its ability to convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical movements into electricity. These devices serve at present an unmet medical and societal need in the monitoring of human activity and enhancing interactions between humans and machines, the optioned interface for setting up verifiable digital twins. Here, a novel composite nanofibrous TENG (CNF&#8208;TENG) based on borophene@poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed through electrospinning. Comprehensive materials characterization of the exfoliated nanosheets confirms crystalline sheet morphology and validates their incorporation into the fibers. The inclusion of borophene introduces a dual innovation by enhancing both the jet stressing in electrospinning and the quality of doped films. This improvement is attributed to the enhanced effective permittivity through interfacial polarization, which promotes &#946;&#8208;phase formation, electron&#8208;donating capacity, surface charge trapping, and refined fiber morphology, while inducing a transition from a hydrophobic to a superhydrophobic surface state. When paired with nylon 66 nanofibers, the CNF&#8208;TENG exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 53.8 &#177; 1.2&#160;V kPa&#8722;1, and a power density of 1.2&#160;W m&#8722;2, representing a 13&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine PVDF&#8208;HFP. An array of 16 ultra&#8208;sensitive CNF&#8208;TENG sensors for possible use in dementia monitoring and sleep disorder mitigation is successfully demonstrated, giving various sleep patterns and physiological data sets.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Crystalline Melon Photocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report for the first time the successful synthesis of sub&#8208;50 nm single&#8208;crystalline melon. It was demonstrated to exhibit reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, longer exciton diffusion lengths, and a higher concentration of surface&#8208;reaching charges compared to conventional melon. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystalline melon exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher H2 evolution efficiency in overall water splitting compared to conventional melon.








ABSTRACT
Melon, as an attractive polymeric semiconductor photocatalyst, holds great potential for efficient one&#8208;step excitation of overall water splitting, yet its quantum yields remain limited by low exciton migration efficiency caused by short exciton diffusion lengths and long migration paths. To address this challenge, we employ a flux&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize sub&#8208;50&#160;nm single&#8208;crystalline melon, which not only prolonged the exciton diffusion length but also shortened the exciton migration path from the bulk exciton coupling region to the catalyst surface. Experimental characterization and structural simulations confirm the successful synthesis of nanoscale single&#8208;crystalline melon via molten salt post&#8208;treatment of amorphous melon in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;CaCl2 ternary system. More importantly, charge carrier dynamics reveal that single&#8208;crystalline melon, owing to its lower defect density, higher interlayer stacking order, and optimized interlayer stacking mode, exhibits reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, longer exciton diffusion lengths, and a higher concentration of surface&#8208;reaching charges compared to conventional melon. Consequently, the melon nanocrystals exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude higher H2 evolution efficiency in overall water splitting compared to conventional melon. These findings pave the way for manufacturing polymeric semiconductor nanocrystals for efficient solar energy conversion.

A heterojunction&#8208;synergized nanofluidic ionic diode couples charge separation in SiNWs/Al&#8208;doped TiO2 with rectified OH&#8722;/H3O+ transport in asymmetric nanochannels and nanopores to harvest evaporation&#8208;driven capillary energy. The SiNWs/ATO hydrovoltaic electricity generator delivers record&#8208;high voltage, current density, and power density among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HEGs, offering a general strategy for durable, high&#8208;performance ambient low&#8208;grade energy harvesting.








ABSTRACT
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators have emerged as a promising strategy for harvesting low&#8208;grade environmental energy. Yet their output remains limited by inefficient charge separation, hydroxyl&#8208;induced electron trapping, and reverse current loss. Herein, we proposed a heterojunction synergized nanofluidic ionic diode concept to enhance HEG performance. Al&#8208;doped TiO2 (ATO) was conformally deposited on vertically aligned Si nanowires (SiNWs) via atomic layer deposition to form a SiNWs/ATO heterojunction, where the built&#8208;in electric field facilitates the efficient separation of charge induced by evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow. Simultaneously, a nanofluidic ionic diode is established between positively charged SiNWs/ATO nanochannels and the negatively charged porous CNT membrane, enabling rectified ion&#8208;selective transport. The synergistic effects of the heterojunction and nanofluidic ionic diode significantly promote both electron&#8211;hole separation and anion/cation selective transport. The SiNWs/ATO HEG achieves an updated recorded performance, delivering an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.0&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current density of 71.0 &#181;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, and a peak power density of 45.8 &#181;W&#183;cm&#8722;2, approximately twice the highest values previously reported for HEGs. This work not only achieves a mechanistic co&#8208;optimization of charge separation and ionic transport induced by evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, but also offers a novel design strategy and practical framework to develop high&#8208;performance and durable HEG.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;Heterostructured Nanofluidics for Photo&#8208;Enhanced Upscaling Osmotic Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade&#8208;heterostructured nanofluidics (CHS&#8208;NFs) integrate abundant atomic&#8208;scale type&#8208;I semiconductor and Schottky heterojunctions, which enable continuous and ultrafast coupled electron&#8211;ion transport. These heterointerfaces create localized asymmetric electric fields at the nanoscale, effectively suppressing concentration polarization and compensating for potential drops, thereby achieving both high ion selectivity and high ion flux.








ABSTRACT
Ensuring energy and resource availability constitutes a fundamental pillar of sustainable socioeconomic development. Nanofluidics hold great promise for energy and resource harvesting. However, a critical bottleneck hinders commercialization, namely, that upscaling nanofluidic areas to boost ion currents triggers severe potential drop and concentration polarization, causing a drastic degradation in selectivity. Here, we engineered cascade&#8208;heterostructured nanofluidics (CHS&#8208;NFs) featuring numerous atomic&#8208;level type&#8208;I semiconductor heterojunctions and Schottky junctions to create continuous, ultrafast pathways for coupled electron&#8208;ion transport. The heterointerfaces generate nanoscale localized asymmetric electric fields that mitigate concentration polarization and offset potential drops, thereby realizing high ion selectivity and flux. As a result, the CHS&#8208;NFs achieve a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 49.5%&#8212;approaching the theoretical limit of 50%&#8212;over a large area (28&#160;mm2, 933 times larger than prior areas), with an exceptional Na+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 332.3. The electricity produced by CHS&#8208;NFs&#8208;based osmotic cells is effectively stored in capacitors and ion batteries under simulated solar irradiation, exhibiting a 68.8% capacity increase compared with a non&#8208;irradiated one. Notably, the cells can generate a high ionic current (467.6&#160;&#181;A), enabling the selective electrochemical recovery of gold from solutions with near&#8208;100% purity, as well as other valuable metals, significantly reducing the energy footprint of industrial metallurgy.

         <title>Scalable and Multifunctional PAN&#8208;MXene Composite Fibers for Thermal Management, Photothermal Conversion, Energy Harvesting, and Sensing for Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun PAN&#8208;MXene nanofibers and yarns integrate enhanced thermal conductivity, photothermal conversion, and triboelectric energy harvesting within a flexible architecture. Interconnected MXene networks promote efficient phonon transport, while their surface chemistry strengthens tribo&#8208;negative behavior, enabling a high power density of 432.7 mW m&#8722;2 and a sensitive tactile response for multifunctional smart textile applications.








ABSTRACT
Developing multifunctional materials that combine efficient heat conduction, energy harvesting, sensing capability, and flexibility is crucial for next&#8208;generation portable and wearable electronics. Here, exploiting the remarkable properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets, multifunctional polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;MXene nanofibers and yarns are fabricated via a straightforward and scalable electrospinning process. Incorporation of MXenes enhances the thermal conductivity of individual PAN nanofibers, as measured by scanning thermal microscopy, and greatly increases the heat conduction capacity of composite yarns, showing a &#8764;22&#176;C higher surface temperature recorded by infrared thermography. The composite nanofibers also exhibit strong passive heating capability, rapidly reaching up to 60&#176;C under infrared irradiation. Furthermore, MXenes elevate the tribo&#8208;negative character of PAN nanofibers, decreasing their surface potential to &#8722;360&#160;mV and yielding a high triboelectric power density of 432.7 mW&#160;m&#8722;2, approximately 25% higher than pristine PAN. Moreover, the produced composite yarns demonstrate reliable tactile&#8208;sensing performance, detecting forces as low as 0.1 N. Altogether, these flexible and durable PAN&#8208;MXene structures provide a promising route toward sustainable and energy&#8208;autonomous electronic textiles, offering new opportunities in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and smart sensing systems.

         <title>High Photostrictive Strain Rate in Ferroelectric AlScN Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric AlScN thin films exhibit an ultrafast photostrictive strain rate of 3.6 s&#8722;1 under above&#8208;bandgap modulated light, about two orders of magnitude higher than conventional bulk ferroelectrics. The fast strain response arises from the nanoscaled columnar polarized domain structure that minimizes RC delay and carrier travel distance. This&#160;further enables non&#8208;contact light&#8208;driven actuation and acoustic&#8208;wave generation.








ABSTRACT
Photostriction refers to non&#8208;thermal strain in materials induced by light, such as through opto&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical coupling involving the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and the converse piezoelectric effect in a ferroelectric material. Conventional ferroelectric photostrictive responses are extremely slow, with strain rates below 10&#8722;3 s&#8722;1 due to the long timescale of BPVE, limiting their use in high&#8208;frequency or signal transmission applications. This work demonstrates a significantly enhanced photostrictive strain rate of 3.6 s&#8722;1 in scandium aluminium nitride (Al0.58Sc0.42N) thin films under modulated continuous light excitation. The light&#8208;induced strain amplitude is equivalent to that of electric&#8208;field induced strain with 2&#160;V applied across the film, underscoring the significant and competitive opto&#8208;mechanical coupling. This fast response is attributed to nanoscale columnar domains that reduce the electric time delay and charge carrier drift distances, enabling rapid strain generation. The demonstrated fast photostriction provides a unique pathway for light&#8208;driven actuation and acoustic wave excitation without requiring electrical wiring, electrodes or electric poling, thus, opening opportunities for developing acoustic micro&#8208;actuators and novel optomechanical systems operating in a non&#8208;contact mode.

         <title>ROS&#8208;Triggered Hemispheroid Adhesive Micromotors for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive hemispheroid adhesive micromotors (HMPs) as efficient delivery systems is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) here. Such hydrogel micromotors are composed of a platinum (Pt) layer and dopamine (DOPA) coating layer covered on their top surface and baseplate, respectively. Upon exposure to the ROS environment, HMPs can achieve the autonomous propulsion fueled by the generated oxygen bubbles. Consequently, HMPs loaded with dexamethasone (DXM) demonstrated a potent therapeutic effect against IBD.








ABSTRACT
The use of micromotors&#8208;based delivery systems for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has recently gained considerable interest. The current research primarily focuses on how to design micromotors with more elaborate geometries and actuation mechanisms to improve IBD therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive hemispheroid adhesive micromotors (HMPs) as efficient delivery systems is developed to treat IBD. Such HMPs are fabricated through microfluidic electrospray technique, with a platinum (Pt) layer and dopamine (DOPA) coating layer covered on its top surface and baseplate, respectively. The Pt on HMPs&#8242; top surface can produce oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, thereby providing a propulsion force for them to move spontaneously upon exposure to ROS environment. Moreover, the DOPA layer on the baseplate contributed to the outstanding adhesive capacity to tissues. Therefore, by incorporating anti&#8208;inflammatory dexamethasone (DXM) into HMPs, the resultant micromotor systems are imparted with superior antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory capacities, which also exhibits desirable therapeutic effect upon treating IBD by alleviating inflammatory response, restoring epithelial barrier functions, and mitigating IBD&#8208;associated symptoms. The treatment mechanism of DXM&#8208;loaded HMPs mainly involves alleviating oxidative stress, reducing proinflammatory cytokines secretion, and protecting intestinal barrier. Collectively, these results illustrate HMPs&#8208;based micromotor systems are valuable for gastrointestinal disease treatment.

Upon exposure to the ROS environment, HMPs can achieve the autonomous propulsion fueled by the generated oxygen bubbles. Consequently, HMPs loaded with dexamethasone (DXM) demonstrated a potent therapeutic effect against IBD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of micromotors-based delivery systems for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has recently gained considerable interest. The current research primarily focuses on how to design micromotors with more elaborate geometries and actuation mechanisms to improve IBD therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hemispheroid adhesive micromotors (HMPs) as efficient delivery systems is developed to treat IBD. Such HMPs are fabricated through microfluidic electrospray technique, with a platinum (Pt) layer and dopamine (DOPA) coating layer covered on its top surface and baseplate, respectively. The Pt on HMPs&#8242; top surface can produce oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, thereby providing a propulsion force for them to move spontaneously upon exposure to ROS environment. Moreover, the DOPA layer on the baseplate contributed to the outstanding adhesive capacity to tissues. Therefore, by incorporating anti-inflammatory dexamethasone (DXM) into HMPs, the resultant micromotor systems are imparted with superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, which also exhibits desirable therapeutic effect upon treating IBD by alleviating inflammatory response, restoring epithelial barrier functions, and mitigating IBD-associated symptoms. The treatment mechanism of DXM-loaded HMPs mainly involves alleviating oxidative stress, reducing proinflammatory cytokines secretion, and protecting intestinal barrier. Collectively, these results illustrate HMPs-based micromotor systems are valuable for gastrointestinal disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colloid&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hierarchically Porous Amorphous Catalyst for Durable Industrial&#8208;Scale Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloid&#8208;mediated electroless plating (CMEP) strategy is proposed to fabricate hierarchically porous, amorphous Fe&#8208;doped NiWB electrocatalysts under ambient conditions. The in situ formation of Fe&#8208;W&#8208;O colloidal species guides the formation of robust, porous catalyst layers with excellent mass transfer and durability, sustaining 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h, showcasing a scalable, low&#8208;cost platform for industrial hydrogen production via AEM electrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Efficient and scalable hydrogen production via water electrolysis requires electrode architectures that combine high catalytic activity, effective active&#8208;site utilization, and mechanical durability at industrial current densities. However, conventional synthesis routes often produce dense, fragile catalyst layers that limit performance and scalability. Herein, a colloid&#8208;mediated electroless plating (CMEP) strategy is reported for the facile fabrication of hierarchically porous, amorphous Fe&#8208;NiWB electrodes under ambient conditions. During CMEP, the in situ generation of Fe&#8208;W&#8208;O colloids suppresses compact layer growth, yielding an open architecture with abundant accessible sites, accelerated mass transfer, and strong substrate anchoring. Comprehensive structural and electronic analyses reveal that Fe incorporation modulates the local coordination environment, enhances intrinsic activity, and promotes beneficial dynamic surface reconstruction under alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. The resulting electrode delivers excellent bifunctional activity and stability, sustaining 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 2000 h with negligible degradation in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). When integrated into an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, it delivers 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.55 V with remarkable long&#8208;term durability. A preliminary techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) highlights the scalability and cost competitiveness of this approach, underscoring its promise for economically viable large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

         <title>Buried Interface Chelating Molecular Bridge Strategy Enables Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;thienedicarboxylic acid (TDCA) with dual bonding sites is used as interfacial connecting bridge to fill the voids between Me&#8208;4PACz molecules to form a denser HSL. Furthermore, the C&#9552;O groups and S atom in TDCA can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, effectively passivating buried interface defects. Consequently, the PSCs based on TDCA interface layer achieved a champion PCE of 26.15%.








ABSTRACT
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole&#8208;transport layers (HTLs) have enabled remarkable performance in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the uneven coverage and terminal carbazole groups of Me&#8208;4PACz SAMs cannot effectively passivate defects, which constrains further improvements in device performance. Herein, we use post&#8208;assembled chelating molecular bridge strategy to introduce 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylic acid (TDCA) as interface layer between Me&#8208;4PACz HTL and perovskite layer, which not only ensures the priority deposition of the primary Me&#8208;4PACz SAM, but also fills voids within the Me&#8208;4PACz HTL to form dense and uniform bilayer HTL. In addition, the C&#9552;O groups and S atom in TDCA can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, effectively passivating buried interface defects. Consequently, the PSCs based on TDCA interface layer achieved a champion PCE of 26.15%. It is noteworthy that this strategy has excellent process compatibility. The PCE of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV) and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77&#160;eV) PSCs are 26.20% and 21.65%, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding PSCs maintain more than 94.2% and 90.7% of initial efficiency after 2500&#160;h in a glove box and 1000&#160;h under one&#8208;sun illumination, respectively. This work provides a promising buried interface molecular bridge strategy for high&#8208;performance PSCs.
