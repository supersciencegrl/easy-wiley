         <title>Ultra&#8208;large Stress and Strain Polymer Nanocomposite Actuators Incorporating a Mutually&#8208;Interpenetrated, Collective&#8208;Deformation Carbon Nanotube Network</title>

Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;based actuators have been extensively studied, with the challenging goal of achieving comprehensive performance metrics that include large output stress and strain, fast response, and versatile actuation modes. The design and fabrication of nanocomposites offer a promising route to integrate the advantages of both polymers and nanoscale fillers, thus ensuring superior performance. Here, we start from a three&#8208;dimensional porous sponge to fabricate a mutually interpenetrated nanocomposite, in which the embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) network undergoes collective deformation with the shape memory polymer (SMP) matrix during large&#8208;degree stretching and releasing, increases junction density with polymer chains and enhances molecular orientation. These features result in substantial improvement of the overall mechanical properties and during thermally actuated contraction, the bulk SMP/CNT composites exhibit output stresses up to 19.5 &#177; 0.97&#160;MPa and strains up to 69%, accompanied by a rapid response and high energy density, exceeding the majority of recent reports. Furthermore, electrical actuation is also demonstrated via uniform Joule heating across the self&#8208;percolated CNT network. Applications as low&#8208;temperature thermal actuated vascular stent and wound&#8208;dressing have been explored. Our findings lay out a universal blueprint for developing robust and highly deformable SMP/CNT nanocomposite actuators with broad potential applications.

         <title>Transient Nanoscopy of Exciton Dynamics in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electronic and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are dominated by strong excitonic resonances. Exciton dynamics plays a critical role in the functionality and performance of many miniaturized 2D optoelectronic devices; however, the measurement of nanoscale excitonic responses remains challenging. Here, a near&#8208;field transient nanoscopy is reported to probe exciton dynamics beyond the diffraction limit. Exciton recombination and exciton&#8208;exciton annihilation processes in monolayer and bilayer MoS2 are studied as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration. Moreover, with the capability to access local sites, intriguing exciton dynamics near the monolayer&#8208;bilayer interface and at the MoS2 nano&#8208;wrinkles are resolved. Such nanoscale resolution highlights the potential of this transient nanoscopy for fundamental investigation of exciton physics and further optimization of functional devices.

         <title>TSG6&#8208;Exo@CS/GP Attenuates Endometrium Fibrosis by Inhibiting Macrophage Activation in a Murine IUA Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrauterine adhesion (IUA), commonly known as Asherman's syndrome, is a disease characterized by the formation of fibrous scar tissue within the uterine cavity, which can lead to severe clinical complications and significantly compromise the reproductive health and fertility of women. Unfortunately, severe cases of IUA currently lack effective treatment. This study presents a novel approach that utilizes TSG6&#8208;modified exosomes (Exos) in conjunction with an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (CS/GP) to mitigate the occurrence of IUA by reducing endometrium fibrosis in a mouse IUA model. The findings of this study demonstrate that TSG6&#8208;modified Exos effectively inhibit the activation of inflammatory M1&#8208;like macrophages during the initial stages of inflammation and maintains the balance of macrophage phenotypes (M1/M2) during the repair phase. Moreover, TSG6 inhnibits the interaction between macrophages and endometrial stromal fibroblasts, thereby preventing the activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, our research indicates that CS/GP facilitates the sustained release of TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, leading to a significant reduction in both the manifestations of IUA and the extent of endometrium fibrosis. Collectively, through the successful construction of CS/GP loaded with TSG6&#8208;modified Exos, we have achieved a reduction in the occurrence and progression of IUA by mitigating endometrium fibrosis. Consequently, this approach holds promise for the treatment of IUA.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Attention Network based Spectral Reconstruction with Snapshot Near&#8208;Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral information is important for detecting and analyzing material compositions. However, snapshot NIR spectral imaging systems still pose significant challenges owing to the lack of high&#8208;performance NIR filters and bulky setups, preventing effective encoding and integration with mobile devices. In this study, we introduce a snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact NIR metasurface featuring 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures. Benefitting from the sufficient spectral variety and low correlation coefficient among these structures, center&#8208;wavelength accuracy of 0.05&#160;nm and full width at half maximum (FWHM) accuracy of 0.13&#160;nm are realized. The system maintains good performance within an incident angle of 1&#176;. A novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction (MAN&#8208;IDR) algorithm guided by both meta&#8208;attention and spatial&#8208;spectral attention is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality NIR spectral imaging. By leveraging the designed metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR, the NIR spectral images, exhibiting precise textures, minimal artifacts in the spatial dimension, and little crosstalk between spectral channels, are reconstructed from a single grayscale recording image. Furthermore, the reconstruction of images in different colors with spatial overlaps is successfully demonstrated, showing the remarkable potential of the system in distinguishing objects. By enabling practical image reconstruction and distinction, the proposed NIR metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR hold great promise for further integration with smartphones and drones, guaranteeing the adoption of NIR spectral imaging in real&#8208;world scenarios such as aerospace, health diagnostics, and machine vision.

         <title>Achieving Self&#8208;Reinforcing Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Nanogenerator by Magnetocaloric and Magnetization Effects of Gadolinium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (TEHG) has emerged as a promising technology for distributed energy harvesting. However, currently reported hybrid generators are straightforward combinations of two functional components. Moreover, inevitable heat from friction intensifies material abrasion and degrades the performance of polymer&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Here, a self&#8208;reinforcing TEHG that harnesses the magnetocaloric and magnetization effects of gadolinium (Gd) is proposed. The synergy between TENG and electromagnetic generator (EMG) renders them an indivisible unit. Leveraging Gd's magnetocaloric effect, an efficient heat transfer mechanism is constructed to cool the tribolayer and strengthen the device's electrical stability. After 80 hours of continuous operation, the optimized TENG occupies a charge decay rate of only 0.32% per hour, significantly outperforming most existing TENGs. Additionally, Gd's magnetization effect boosts the power of EMG by approximately 80.84%. This work provides a universal solution in hybrid generators where internal components reinforce each other, achieving a synergistic effect of 1+1&gt;2.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;synthesized Surfactant&#8208;free Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube&#8208;based NO2 Sensors: Unprecedentedly High Sensitivity and Fast Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant&#8208;free aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. They showed minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and had the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry&#8208;transferrable and facile one&#8208;step lamination resulted in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor has excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500 ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8 s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8764;0.161 ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long&#8208;term stability for longer than 6 months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT&#8208;based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrated consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT&#8208;based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant-free aerosol-synthesized single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface-to-volume ratios. They showed minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and had the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry-transferrable and facile one-step lamination resulted in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor has excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500 ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8 s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8764;0.161 ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long-term stability for longer than 6 months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT-based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrated consistent gas-sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT-based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The rapid advancement of prevailing communication and sensing technologies necessitates cost&#8208;effective millimeter&#8208;wave arrays equipped with a massive number of phase&#8208;shifting cells to perform complicated beamforming tasks. Conventional approaches employing semiconductor switch/varactor components or tunable materials encounter obstacles such as quantization loss, high cost, high complexity, and limited adaptability for realizing large&#8208;scale arrays and operating at millimeter&#8208;wave frequencies. Here, we report a low&#8208;cost, ultrathin, fast&#8208;response, and large&#8208;scale solution relying on advanced metasurface (i.e., the 2D version of a bulk 3D metamaterial) concepts combined together with ultrathin liquid crystal (LC) materials requiring a layer thickness of only 5 &#956;m. Rather than immersing resonant structures in LCs, a joint material&#8208;circuit&#8208;based strategy is devised, via integrating deep&#8208;subwavelength&#8208;thick nematic LCs into slow&#8208;wave structures, to achieve constitutive metacells (i.e., artificial atoms or meta&#8208;atoms) with continuous phase shifting and stable reflectivity. A LC&#8208;facilitated reconfigurable metasurface system containing more than 2300 metacells is realized with its unprecedented comprehensive wavefront manipulation capacity validated through three diverse beamforming functions, including beam focusing/steering, reconfigurable OAM&#8208;carrying beams, and tunable holograms, demonstrating a milli&#8208;second&#8208;level function&#8208;switching speed. The proposed methodology offers a paradigm shift for modulating electromagnetic waves in a non&#8208;resonating broadband fashion with fast&#8208;response and low&#8208;cost properties by exploiting functionalized LC&#8208;enabled metasurfaces. Moreover, it is expected that this extremely agile metasurface&#8208;enabled antenna technology will facilitate a transformative impact on communication/sensing systems and empower new possibilities for wavefront engineering and diffractive wave calculation/inference.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <title>Bioinspired Bottlebrush Polymers Effectively Alleviate Frictional Damage Both In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocompatible bottlebrush polymer (BB) can rapidly adhere to various substrates, offering exceptional antifouling and lubricant properties. It holds promise for treating diseases linked to bio&#8208;lubricant systems and optimizing the performance of medical devices, including contact lenses.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers (BB) have emerged as compelling candidates for biosystems to face tribological challenges, including friction and wear. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of an engineered triblock BB polymer's affinity, cell toxicity, lubrication, and wear protection in both in vitro and in vivo settings, focusing on applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and dry eye syndrome. Results show that the designed polymer rapidly adheres to various surfaces (e.g., cartilage, eye, and contact lens), forming a robust, biocompatible layer for surface lubrication and protection. The tribological performance and biocompatibility are further enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo. The exceptional lubrication performance and favorable interaction with HA position the synthesized triblock polymer as a promising candidate for innovative treatments addressing deficiencies in bio&#8208;lubricant systems.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO1.8H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Enabled Printable Asymmetric Self&#8208;Insulated Stretchable Conductor for Human Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel printable, flexible material composed of conducting polymer and liquid metal, which is capable of self&#8208;assembly upon printing, producing asymmetric highly conductive stretchable conductors for human interface.








Abstract
Soft and stretchable conductors with high electrical conductivity and tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are crucial for both on&#8208;skin and implantable electronic devices. Liquid metal&#8208;based conductors hold great promise due to their metallic conductivity and minimal stiffness. However, the surface oxidation of liquid metal particles in polymeric matrices poses a challenge in forming a continuous pathway for highly conductive elastic composites. Here, it is reported a printable composite material based on liquid metal and conducting polymer that undergoes a self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high conductivity (2089 S cm&#8722;1) in the bottom surface while maintaining an insulated top surface, high stretchability (&gt;800%), and a modulus akin to human skin tissue. This material is further applied to fabricate skin&#8208;interfaced strain sensors and electromyogram sensors through 3D printing.

         <title>Photothermal Mineralization of Polyolefin Microplastics via TiO2 Hierarchical Porous Layer&#8208;Based Semiwetting Air&#8208;Plastic&#8208;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase system based on a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) is established. It boosts the photoexcitation and transfer of charge carriers and the interfacial diffusion of gaseous oxygen, greatly improving low&#8208;density polyethylene photothermal mineralization relative to a conventional diphase system. Investigations into micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano level wettability at air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces help unravel the interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction process.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;mineralization of microplastics under mild conditions has emerged as a promising solution to plastic waste disposal. However, the inadequate contact between oxygen, water&#8208;insoluble polyolefin microplastics, and photocatalysts remains a critical issue. In this study, a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) photocatalyst is presented to establish air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase interfaces for the photothermal mineralization of polyolefins. The wettability of the TiO2&#8208;HPL&#8208;based triphase interface is finely controlled from plastophobic to plastophilic. High&#8208;resolution imaging and finite element simulation demonstrate the significance of a semiwetting state in achieving multidirectional oxygen diffusion through the hierarchical pore structure while maintaining sufficient contact between the plastic phase and photocatalysts. For low&#8208;density polyethylene, the TiO2&#8208;HPL achieves a photothermal mineralization rate of 5.63 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a conversion of 26.3% after 20 h of continuous irradiation. Additionally, the triphase photocatalytic system with semiwetting gas&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces shows good universality for various polyolefin reagents and products, illustrating its potential in achieving efficient photothermal mineralization of non&#8208;degradable microplastics.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;Induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation control is possible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a hydrated state, and this affects to create cracks induced by drying. A method is for controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fractures through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID). The straightforward approach devised for aligning cracks has the potential for use in various patterning applications.








Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspires the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make dryinginduced cracks. The controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) is explored. The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and in the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;stable high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheet (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) photocatalyst capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction is synthesized for the first time. The HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs due to the interplay between the different metals in the framework of the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS that enables more efficient charge transfer.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising platforms for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their fascinating physiochemical properties. Rationally engineering the compositions and structures of MOFs can provide abundant opportunities for their optimization. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have demonstrated great potential in the energy and environment fields. However, there is still no report on the development of high&#8208;entropy MOFs (HE&#8208;MOFs) for photocatalytic HER in aqueous solution. Herein, the authors report the synthesis of a novel p&#8208;type HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;single crystal (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC) and the corresponding HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;nanosheets (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic HER. Both HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC and HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibit higher photocatalytic HER activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs, which are supposed to be ascribed to the interplay between the different metal nodes in the HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;that enables more efficient charge transfer. Moreover, impressively, the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS demonstrates much higher photocatalytic activity than the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC due to its thin thickness and enhanced surface area. At optimum conditions, the rate of H2 evolution on the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS is &#8776;13.24 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is among the highest values reported for water&#8208;stable MOF photocatalysts. This work highlights the importance of developing advanced high&#8208;entropy materials toward enhanced photocatalysis.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric (HfO2)/2D Semiconductor (HfSe2) Gate Stack for Low&#8208;Power Steep&#8208;Switching Computing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 on 2D HfSe2) is proposed for future low&#8208;power computing applications. The proposed gate stack exhibits atomically sharp interface with suppressed gate leakage ensuring ideal operation (subthreshold slope (SS) &#8776; 60 mV dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, steep&#8208;switching operation (SS &#8776; 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1) overcoming the fundamental Boltzmann limit is demonstrated at room temperature with gated&#8208;region&#8208;controlled structure.








Abstract
Herein, a high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 formed on 2D HfSe2) fabricated via plasma oxidation is reported, realizing an atomically sharp interface with a suppressed interface trap density (Dit &#8776; 5 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2 eV&#8722;1). The chemically converted HfO2 exhibits dielectric constant, &#954; &#8776; 23, resulting in low gate leakage current (&#8776;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2) at equivalent oxide thickness &#8776;0.5 nm. Density functional calculations indicate that the atomistic mechanism for achieving a high&#8208;quality interface is the possibility of O atoms replacing the Se atoms of the interfacial HfSe2 layer without a substitution energy barrier, allowing layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer oxidation to proceed. The field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor&#8208;fabricated HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack demonstrates an almost ideal subthreshold slope (SS) of &#8776;61 mV dec&#8722;1 (over four orders of IDS) at room temperature (300 K), along with a high Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;108 and a small hysteresis of &#8776;10 mV. Furthermore, by utilizing a device architecture with separately controlled HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack and channel structures, an impact ionization field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated that exhibits n&#8208;type steep&#8208;switching characteristics with a SS value of 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature, overcoming the Boltzmann limit. These results provide a significant step toward the realization of post&#8208;Si semiconducting devices for future energy&#8208;efficient data&#8208;centric computing electronics.

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional Neural Probe (SAMP) Using Forest&#8208;Drawn CNT Sheet onto Thermally Drawn Polymer Fiber for Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT&#8208;sheets drawn from CNT&#8208;forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers is proposed. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post&#8208;implantation. The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality position it as a promising platform for long&#8208;term neuroscience research.

         <title>Bacterial Biohybrids for Invasion of Tumor Cells Promote Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation Through Gap Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial biohybrid is designed by modifying live bacterium VNP20009 (VNP) with chito&#8208;oligosaccharide biopolymers to directly enter into tumor cells and bolster antigen cross&#8208;presentation through VNP&#8208;induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells surface, which is achieved through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP.








Abstract
Due to inherent differences in cellular composition and metabolic behavior with host cells, tumor&#8208;harbored bacteria can discriminatorily affect tumor immune landscape. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular bacteria affect antigen presentation process between tumor cells and antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) are largely unknown. The invasion behavior of attenuated Salmonella VNP20009 (VNP) into tumor cells is investigated and an attempt is made to modulate this behavior by modifying positively charged polymers on the surface of VNP. It is found that non&#8208;toxic chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) modified VNP (VNP@COS) bolsters the formation of gap junction between tumor cells and APCs by enhancing the ability of VNP to infect tumor cells. On this basis, a bacterial biohybrid is designed to promote in situ antigen cross&#8208;presentation through intracellular bacteria induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP@COS. This strategic integration serves to heighten the immunogenic exposure of tumor antigens; while, preserving the cytotoxic potency of T cells. A strategy is proposed to precisely controlling the function and local effects of microorganisms within tumors.

         <title>Revolutionizing Neurocare: Biomimetic Nanodelivery via Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain disorders represent a significant challenge in medical science due to the formidable blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which severely limits the penetration of conventional therapeutics, hindering effective treatment strategies. This review delves into the innovative realm of biomimetic nanodelivery systems, including stem cell&#8208;derived nanoghosts, tumor cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, and erythrocyte membrane&#8208;based carriers, highlighting their potential to circumvent the BBB's restrictions. By mimicking native cell properties, these nanocarriers emerge as a promising solution for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, offering a strategic advantage in overcoming the barrier's selective permeability. We evaluate the unique benefits of leveraging cell membranes from various sources and examine advanced technologies for fabricating cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles capable of masquerading as endogenous cells. This enables the targeted delivery of a broad spectrum of therapeutic agents, ranging from small molecule drugs to proteins, thereby providing an innovative approach to neurocare. Furthermore, the review contrasts the capabilities and limitations of these biomimetic nanocarriers with traditional delivery methods, underlining their potential to enable targeted, sustained, and minimally invasive treatment modalities. We conclude with a perspective on the clinical translation of these biomimetic systems, underscoring their transformative impact on the therapeutic landscape for intractable brain diseases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain disorders represent a significant challenge in medical science due to the formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB), which severely limits the penetration of conventional therapeutics, hindering effective treatment strategies. This review delves into the innovative realm of biomimetic nanodelivery systems, including stem cell-derived nanoghosts, tumor cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, and erythrocyte membrane-based carriers, highlighting their potential to circumvent the BBB's restrictions. By mimicking native cell properties, these nanocarriers emerge as a promising solution for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, offering a strategic advantage in overcoming the barrier's selective permeability. We evaluate the unique benefits of leveraging cell membranes from various sources and examine advanced technologies for fabricating cell membrane-encapsulated nanoparticles capable of masquerading as endogenous cells. This enables the targeted delivery of a broad spectrum of therapeutic agents, ranging from small molecule drugs to proteins, thereby providing an innovative approach to neurocare. Furthermore, the review contrasts the capabilities and limitations of these biomimetic nanocarriers with traditional delivery methods, underlining their potential to enable targeted, sustained, and minimally invasive treatment modalities. We conclude with a perspective on the clinical translation of these biomimetic systems, underscoring their transformative impact on the therapeutic landscape for intractable brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid&#8208;flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: (1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; (2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, we introduce a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nano&#8208;cellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhance Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8208;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes design enable stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h, and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibit excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries at room temperature.

Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, we report a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors. We employ micro&#8208;computed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN*mm. They were functionalized with fertilizer and have been successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>Self&#8208;lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here we present a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of contact lenses. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the contact lens material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least three weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the contact lens surface. We present a self&#8208;lubricating contact lens prototype where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial contact lenses. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of contact lenses for vision correction. We envision that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living contact lens could enable long term wear comfort for contact lens users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>Orbital Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;Dielectric for Droplet Manipulation on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (EWOD), recognized as the most successful electrical droplet actuation method, is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite significant advances, it remains challenging to achieve repeatability, high speed, and simple circuitry in EWOD&#8208;based droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, its efficient operation typically requires electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control. Here, we report a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital EWOD (OEW). Due to the asymmetric electrowetting force generated on the orbit, flexible and versatile droplet manipulation is facilitated with OEW. We demonstrate that OEW droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits higher speed (up to 5 times faster), enhanced functionality (anti&#8208;gravity), and manipulation of diverse liquids (acid, base, salt, organic, e.g., methyl blue, artificial blood) without contamination, and good durability after 1000 tests. We envision that this robust droplet manipulation strategy using OEW would provide a valuable platform for various processes involving droplets, spanning from microfluidic devices to controllable chemical reactions. The previously unreported droplet manipulation phenomenon and control strategy shown in this study can potentially upgrade EWOD&#8208;based microfluidics, antifogging, anti&#8208;icing, dust removal, and beyond.

         <title>Programmable, High&#8208;resolution Printing of Spatially Graded Perovskites for Multispectral Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Micro/nanostructured perovskites with spatially graded compositions and bandgaps are promising in filter&#8208;free, chip&#8208;level multispectral and hyperspectral detection. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution patterning of perovskites with controlled graded compositions is challenging. Here, we present a programmable mixed electrohydrodynamic printing (M&#8208;ePrinting) technique to realize the one&#8208;step direct&#8208;printing of arbitrary spatially graded perovskite micro/nanopatterns for the first time. M&#8208;ePrinting enables in&#8208;situ mixing and ejection of solutions with controlled composition/bandgap by programmably varying driving voltage applied to a multi&#8208;channel nozzle. Composition can be graded over a single dot, line or complex pattern, and the printed feature size is down to 1&#160;&#181;m, which is the highest printing resolution of graded patterns to our knowledge. Photodetectors based on micro/nanostructured perovskites with halide ions gradually varying from Br to I were constructed, which successfully achieve multispectral detection and full&#8208;color imaging, with a high detectivity and responsivity of 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones and 69.88 A/W, respectively. Our presented method provides a versatile and competitive approach for such miniaturized bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite spectrometer platforms and artificial vision systems, and also opens new avenues for the digital fabrication of composition&#8208;programmable structures.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;based Binary Alloy with Oxide Nanosheath for Highly Efficient and Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>

Abstract
Traditional noble metal oxide, such as RuO2, is considered a benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its practical application is limited due to sluggish activity and severe electrochemical corrosion. In this study, we synthesize Ru&#8208;Fe nanoparticles loading on carbon felt (RuFe@CF) via an ultrafast joule&#8208;heating method as an active and durable OER catalyst in acidic conditions. Remarkably low overpotentials of 188 and 269&#160;mV are achieved at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, with a robust stability up to 620 hours at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When used as an anode in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, our catalyst shows more than 250 hours of stability at a water&#8208;splitting current of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, indicating its potential for practical applications. Experimental characterizations reveal the presence of a Ru&#8208;based oxide nanosheath on the surface of the catalyst during OER tests, suggesting a surface reconstruction process that enhances the intrinsic activity and inhibits continuous metal dissolution. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of Fe into the RuFe@CF catalyst reduces the energy barrier and boosts its activities. This work offers an effective and universal strategy for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts for acidic water splitting.

         <title>Observing Proton&#8208;Electron Mixed Conductivity in Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mixed conducting materials with both ionic and electronic conductivities have gained prominence in emerging applications. However, exploring material with on&#8208;demand ionic and electronic conductivities remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of correlating macroscopic conductivity with atom&#8208;scale structure. Here, we explore the correlation of proton&#8208;electron conductivity and atom&#8208;scale structure in graphdiyne. Precisely adjusting the conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups in graphdiyne yields a tunable proton&#8208;electron conductivity on the order of 103. In addition, we provide a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates. Utilizing the proton&#8208;electron conductivity and mechanical tolerance of graphdiyne, we create bimodal flexible devices serving as capacitive switches and resistive sensors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we design a breath&#8208;machine interface for sentence&#8208;based communication and self&#8208;nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98%. Our work represents an important step towards understanding the atom&#8208;scale structure&#8211;conductivity relationship and extending the applications of mixed conducting materials to assistive technology.

         <title>Room temperature phosphorescence from natural, organic emitters and their application in industrially compostable programmable luminescent tags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic semiconductors provide the potential of biodegradable technologies, but prototypes do only rarely exist. We present transparent, ultrathin programmable luminescent tags for minimalistic yet efficient information storage that are fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use materials (bioPLTs). As natural emitters, the quinoline alkaloids show sufficient room temperature phosphorescence when being embedded in a polymer matrix with cinchonine exhibiting superior performance. Polylactic acid provides a solution for both the matrix material and the flexible substrate. Room temperature phosphorescence can be locally controlled by the oxygen concentration in the film by using Exceval as additional oxygen blocking layers. These bioPLTs exhibit all function&#8208;defining characteristics also found in their regular non&#8208;environmentally degradable analogs and, additionally, provide a simplified, high&#8208;contrast readout under continuous&#8208;wave illumination as a consequence of the unique luminescence properties of the natural emitter cinchonine. Limitations for flexible devices arise from limited thermal stability of the polylactic acid foil used as substrate allowing only for one writing cycle and preventing an annealing step during fabrication. Few&#8208;cycle reprogramming is possible when using the architecture of the bioPLTs on regular quartz substrates. This work realizes the versatile platform of PLTs with less harmful materials offering a more sustainable use in future.

         <title>A Boron, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Pure Blue Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitter for Organic Light Emitting Diodes That Shows Fast kRISC Without the Use of Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Narrowband emissive multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are a promising solution to achieve the current industry targeted color standard, BT.2020, for blue color without using optical filters, aiming for high efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, their long triplet lifetimes, largely affected by their slow reverse intersystem crossing rates, adversely affect device stability. In this study, a helical MR&#8208;TADF emitter (f&#8208;DOABNA) has been designed and synthesized. Because of its &#960;&#8208;delocalized structure, f&#8208;DOABNA possesses a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap, &#916;EST, and displays simultaneously an exceptionally faster reverse intersystem crossing rate constant, kRISC, of up to 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 and a very high photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL, of over 90% in both solution and doped films. The OLED with f&#8208;DOABNA as the emitter achieved a narrow deep&#8208;blue emission at 445&#160;nm (full width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#160;nm) associated with CIE coordinates of 0.150, 0.041, and showed a high maximum external quantum efficiency, EQEmax, of &#8764;20%.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
4D (bio&#8208;)printing endows 3D printed (bio&#8208;)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, micro&#8208;needles, smart 3D&#8208;cell engineered micro&#8208;environments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi&#8208;)stimuli. Here, we first highlight the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio&#8208;)printing. Then, we present a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discuss the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including In vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape&#8208;transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning&#8208;based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8208;property and design&#8208;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Oxidation&#8208;Reduction of Iodide Ions for Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite rapid advancements in the photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their operational stability remains a significant challenge for commercialization. This instability mainly arises from light&#8208;induced halide ion migration and subsequent oxidation into iodine (I2). The situation is exacerbated when considering the heat effects at elevated temperatures, leading to the volatilization of I2 and resulting in irreversible device degradation. To the end, a thiol&#8208;contained reducing agent, mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI), has been incorporated into the perovskite film. This addition aims to prevent the oxidation of iodide ions, thereby suppressing the light&#8208;induced degradation pathway of FAPbI3&#8594;FAI+PbI2. Additionally, the formation of a thiol&#8208;disulfide/I&#8722;&#8208;I2 redox pair within the perovskite film provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I2 under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine&#8208;induced degradations. This approach significantly enhances the operational stability of PSCs. Under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 testing protocol (MPP tracking in an environment with relative humidity of &#8764;50% at &#8764;65&#160;&#176;C), the treated PSCs maintain 97% of their original PCE after 300 hours of aging. In contrast, control devices exhibit almost complete degradation, primarily due to rapid thermal&#8208;induced I2 volatilization. These results demonstrate a promising strategy to overcome critical stability challenges in PSCs, particularly in scenarios involving thermal effects.

To the end, a thiol-contained reducing agent, mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI), has been incorporated into the perovskite film. This addition aims to prevent the oxidation of iodide ions, thereby suppressing the light-induced degradation pathway of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;FAI+PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the formation of a thiol-disulfide/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox pair within the perovskite film provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine-induced degradations. This approach significantly enhances the operational stability of PSCs. Under the ISOS-L-3 testing protocol (MPP tracking in an environment with relative humidity of &#8764;50% at &#8764;65&#160;&#176;C), the treated PSCs maintain 97% of their original PCE after 300 hours of aging. In contrast, control devices exhibit almost complete degradation, primarily due to rapid thermal-induced I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; volatilization. These results demonstrate a promising strategy to overcome critical stability challenges in PSCs, particularly in scenarios involving thermal effects.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Arising Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskites for Ionizing Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites have greatly improved moisture stability owing to the large organic cations embedded in the inorganic octahedral structure, which also suppresses the ions migration and reduces the dark current. The suppression of ions migration by 2D perovskites effectively suppresses excessive device noise and baseline drift and shows excellent potential in the direct X&#8208;ray detection field. In addition, 2D perovskites have gradually emerged with many unique properties, such as anisotropy, tunable band gap, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and wide range exciton binding energy, which continuously promote the development of 2D perovskites in ionizing radiation detection. This review aims to systematically summarize the advances and progress of 2D halide perovskite semiconductor and scintillator ionizing radiation detectors, including reported alpha (&#945;) particle, beta (&#946;) particle, neutron, X&#8208;ray, and gamma (&#947;) ray detection. We discuss the unique structural features of 2D perovskites and their advantages in X&#8208;ray detection. We also propose development directions to overcome the limitations of 2D halide perovskite radiation detectors.

         <title>MXene&#8208;enabled Pneumatic Multiscale Shape Morphing for Adaptive, Programmable and Multimodal Radar&#8208;infrared Compatible Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving radar&#8208;infrared compatible camouflage with dynamic adaptability has been a long&#8208;sought goal, but faces significant challenges owing to the limited dispersion relations of conventional material systems operating in different wavelength ranges. Here, we propose the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and design a periodically arranged pneumatic unit consisting of MXene&#8208;based morphable conductors and intake platforms. During gas actuation, the morphable conductor transforms centimeter&#8208;scale 2D flat sheets into 3D balloon shapes to enhance microwave absorption behavior, and also reconfigures micrometer&#8208;scale MXene wrinkles into smooth planes in combination with cavity&#8208;induced low heat transfer to minimize infrared (IR) signatures. Through theory&#8208;guided reverse engineering, the final pneumatic matrix shows remarkable frequency tunability (2.64&#8211;18.0 GHz), moderate IR emissivity regulation (0.14 at 7&#8211;16.5 &#956;m), rapid responsiveness (&#8764;30 ms), wide&#8208;angle operation (&gt; 45&#160;&#176;), and excellent environmental tolerance. Additionally, the multiplexed pneumatic matrix enables over 14 programmable coding sequences that independently alter thermal radiation without compromising radar stealth, and allows multimodal camouflage switching between three distinct compatible states. The approach may facilitate the evolution of camouflage techniques and electromagnetic functional materials towards multispectral, adaptability and intelligence.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Accelerated Li+ Conduction in MOF&#8208;based Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for lithium metal batteries have garnered considerable interests owing to their low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and favorable interfacial compatibility with battery electrodes. Their soft mechanical nature compared to solid inorganic electrolytes give them a large advantage to be used in low pressure solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), which can avoid the cost and weight of the pressure cages. However, the application of SPEs has been hindered by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In addressing this limitation, enormous efforts have been devoted to the experimental investigation and theoretical calculations/simulation of new polymer classes. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be effective in enhancing ion transport in SPEs. However, the mechanisms in enhancing Li+ conductivity have rarely been systematically and comprehensively analyzed. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanisms of MOF&#8208;enhanced Li+ transport in MSPEs in terms of polymer, MOF, MOF/polymer interface (MPI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) aspects, respectively. Moreover, the understanding of Li+ conduction mechanisms through employing advanced characterization tools, theoretical calculations and simulations are also reviewed in this review. Finally, the main challenges in developing MSPEs are deeply analyzed and the corresponding future research directions are also proposed.

         <title>Cobalt MOF&#8208;based Porous Carbonaceous Spheres for Multimodal Soft Actuator Exhibiting Intricate Biomimetic Motions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The advancement of active electrode materials is essential to meet the demand for multifaceted soft robotic interactions. In this study, we report a new type of porous carbonaceous sphere (PCS) for a multimodal soft actuator capable of both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic responses. The PCS, derived from the simultaneous oxidative and reductive breakdown of specially designed cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Co&#8208;MOFs) with varying metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios, exhibits a high specific surface area of 529 m2 g&#8722;1 and a saturated magnetization of 142.7 Am2 kg&#8722;1. The size of the PCS can be controlled through the Ostwald ripening mechanism, while the porous structure can be regulated by adjusting the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand mol ratio. Its exceptional compatibility with PEDOT&#8208;PSS enables the creation of uniform electrode, crucial for producing soft actuators that work in both magnetic and electrical fields. Operated at an ultra&#8208;low voltage of 1&#160;V, the PCS&#8208;based actuator generates a blocking force of 47.5 mN and exhibits significant bending deflection even at an oscillation frequency of 10&#160;Hz. Employing this simultaneous multimodal actuation ensures the dynamic and complex motions of a balancing bird robot and a dynamic eagle robot. This advancement marks a significant step towards the realization of more dynamic and versatile soft robotic systems.

Abstract
Developing coordination complexes (such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, MOFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is currently attracting tremendous attention and remains a significant challenge on achieving MOF with circularly polarized afterglow. Herein, we first reported MOFs based circularly polarized afterglow by combining chiral induction approach and turned the afterglow times by using the auxiliary ligands regulation strategy. The obtained chiral R/S&#8208;ZnIDC, R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpy) and R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpe) containing a similar structure unit display different afterglow times with 3 s, 1 s and &lt; 0.1 s respectively which attribute to that the longer auxiliary ligand hinders the energy transfer through the hydrogen bonding. The obtained chiral complexes reveal strong CD signal, obvious PL afterglow feature and strong CPL performance (glum up to 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;2). Furthermore, we first proposed the photo&#8208;curing 3D printing method to prepare various chiral MOFs based monoliths from 2D patterns to 3D scaffolds for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. This work not only develops chiral complexes monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technique, but opens a new strategy to achieve tunable CPL afterglow in the optical applications.

Abstract
A type of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer composites is reported and showcased that their 3D nanolattices exhibit a superior combination of high strength, toughness, deformability, resilience, and damage&#8208;tolerance. Notably, the strength and toughness of ultralight copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices in some cases surpass current best performers, including alumina, nickel, and other ceramic or metallic lattices at low densities. Additionally, copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices are super&#8208;resilient, crack&#8208;resistant, and one&#8208;step printed under ambient condition which can be easily integrated into sophisticated microsystems as highly effective internal protectors. The findings suggest that, unlike traditional nanocomposites, the laser&#8208;induced interface and the high fraction of ultrasmall Cu15 nanoclusters as crosslinking junctions contribute to the marked nonlinear elasticity of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer network, which synergizes with the lattice&#8208;topology effect and culminates in the exceptional mechanical performance.

         <title>Super&#8208;Stretchable and High&#8208;Energy Micro&#8208;Pseudocapacitors Based on MXene Embedded Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly stretchable Zn&#8208;ion hybrid micro&#8208;pseudocapacitor (ZIH&#8208;MPC) based on in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles on MXene nanosheets (Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene) as flexible film cathode is designed and constructed, which exhibits a stable voltage and energy output even under 100% elongation state. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy to realize high energy density in stretchable hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The advancement of aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors offers an enticing prospect for a broad spectrum of applications, spanning from wearable electronics to micro&#8208;robotics and sensors. Unfortunately, conventional micro&#8208;supercapacitors are characterized by low capacity and slopy voltage profiles, limiting their energy density capabilities. To enhance the performance of these devices, the use of 2D MXene&#8208;based compounds has recently been proposed. Apart from their capacitive contributions, these structures can be loaded with redox&#8208;active nanowires which increase their energy density and stabilize their operation voltage. However, introducing rigid nanowires into MXene films typically leads to a significant decline in their mechanical properties, particularly in terms of flexibility. To overcome this issue, super stretchable micro&#8208;pseudocapacitor electrodes composed of MXene nanosheets and in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles (Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene) are herein demonstrated, delivering high energy density, stable operation voltage of &#8776;1 V, and fast charging capabilities. Careful experimental analysis and theoretical simulations of the charging mechanism of the Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene electrodes reveal a dual nature charge storage mechanism involving ad(de)sorption of ions and conversion reaction of Ag nanoparticles. The superior mechanical properties of synthesized films obtained through in situ construction of Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene structure show an ultra stretchability, allowing the devices to provide stable voltage and energy output even at 100% elongation.

         <title>Guest Acceptors with Lower Electrostatic Potential in Ternary Organic Solar Cells for Minimizing Voltage Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ternary strategy, in which one guest component is introduced into one host binary system, is considered to be one of the most effective ways to realize high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, there is no efficient method to predict the effectiveness of guest components in ternary OSCs. Herein, three guest compositions (i.e., ANF&#8208;1, ANF&#8208;2 and ANF&#8208;3) with different electrostatic potential (ESP) are designed and synthesized by modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the terminal groups through density functional theory simulations. The effects of the introduction of guest component into the host system (D18:N3) on the photovoltaic properties were investigated. The theoretical and experimental studies provide a key rule for guest acceptor in ternary OSCs to improve the open&#8208;circuit voltage, that is, the larger ESP difference between the guest and host acceptor, the stronger the intermolecular interactions and the higher the miscibility, which improves the luminescent efficiency of the blend film and the electroluminescence quantum yield (EQEEL) of the device by reducing the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching, thereby effectively decreasing the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of ternary OSCs. This work will greatly contribute to the development of highly efficient guest components, thereby promoting the rapid breakthrough of the 20% efficiency bottleneck for single&#8208;junction OSCs.

         <title>New Prospects Arising from Dynamically Crosslinked Polymers: Reprogramming Their Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked polymers (DCPs) have gained significant attention owing to their applications in fabricating (re)processable, recyclable, and self&#8208;healable thermosets, which hold great promise in addressing ecological issues such as plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the current research predominantly focuses on redefining and/or manipulating their geometries while replicating their bulk properties. Given the inherent design flexibility of dynamic covalent networks, DCPs also exhibit a remarkable potential for various novel applications through post&#8208;synthesis reprogramming their properties. In this review, we present the recent advancements in strategies that enable DCPs to transform their bulk properties after synthesis. The underlying mechanisms and associated material properties are overviewed mainly through three distinct strategies, namely latent catalysts, material&#8208;growth, and topology isomerizable networks. Furthermore, the mutual relationship and impact of these strategies when integrated within one material system are also discussed. Finally, the application prospects and relevant issues necessitating further investigation, along with the potential solutions are analyzed.

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article focuses on a detailed summary of the energy transformation remote control strategy design for efficient cancer targeting long&#8208;term imaging and therapy, thereby expanding the remote control energy transformation window. By reviewing current research progress, this review paves the way for remote control applications of energy transformation&#8208;based cancer imaging and therapy.








Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy; while, minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Pyroelectric&#8208;Accelerated Perovskite Photodetector for Picosecond Light Detection and Ranging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast pyroelectricity&#8208;assisted perovskite photodetector exhibits a transient responsivity and detectivity of 0.65 A W&#8722;1 and 4.10 &#215; 1012 Jones under 638 nm light. The pyroelectric electrons enable quick direct recombination to the excess holes in the bulk, achieving a remarkable response time of 176 ps.2








Abstract
Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is indispensable in applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous driving, and biomimetic robots. However, the precision and available distance of LiDAR are constrained by the speed and sensitivity of the photodetector, necessitating the use of expensive and energy&#8208;consuming avalanche diodes. To address these challenges, in this study, a pyroelectricity&#8208;based acceleration strategy with 2D&#8208;(graded 3D) perovskite heterojunction is proposed to achieve a record high speed (27.7 ns with an active area of 9 mm2, and 176 ps with an active area of 0.2 mm2) and high responsivity (0.65 A W&#8722;1) at zero bias. This success is attributed to the unique mechanism where the electrons from the pyroelectric effect at the Cl&#8208;rich 2D/3D interface directly recombine with excess holes during light&#8211;dark transitions, breaking speed limitations related to carrier mobility and capacitive effect. Furthermore, the introduced pyroelectric effect significantly enhances the photoresponse, resulting in a self&#8208;powered external quantum efficiency exceeding 100%. The study also demonstrates precise position detection at the centimeter level.

     alt="Pyroelectric-Accelerated Perovskite Photodetector for Picosecond Light Detection and Ranging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrafast pyroelectricity-assisted perovskite photodetector exhibits a transient responsivity and detectivity of 0.65 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.10 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jones&lt;/i&gt; under 638 nm light. The pyroelectric electrons enable quick direct recombination to the excess holes in the bulk, achieving a remarkable response time of 176 ps.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is indispensable in applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous driving, and biomimetic robots. However, the precision and available distance of LiDAR are constrained by the speed and sensitivity of the photodetector, necessitating the use of expensive and energy-consuming avalanche diodes. To address these challenges, in this study, a pyroelectricity-based acceleration strategy with 2D-(graded 3D) perovskite heterojunction is proposed to achieve a record high speed (27.7 ns with an active area of 9 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 176 ps with an active area of 0.2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and high responsivity (0.65 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at zero bias. This success is attributed to the unique mechanism where the electrons from the pyroelectric effect at the Cl-rich 2D/3D interface directly recombine with excess holes during light&#8211;dark transitions, breaking speed limitations related to carrier mobility and capacitive effect. Furthermore, the introduced pyroelectric effect significantly enhances the photoresponse, resulting in a self-powered external quantum efficiency exceeding 100%. The study also demonstrates precise position detection at the centimeter level. In conclusion, this research presents a pioneering approach for developing high-speed photodiodes with exceptional sensitivity, mitigating energy and cost concerns in LiDAR applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleating agent (BTO&#8208;BO) is developed to suppress the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents processing, achieving the active layer with high crystallinity and nano&#8208;scaled phase separation morphology. The resultant OSCs achieve record power conversion efficiencies of 19.42% (0.062&#8208;cm2) and 16.35% (15. 03&#8208;cm2) with excellent operational stabilities.








Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity; while, these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy is developed by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO; while, changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, is lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO is added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembles to form numerous seed crystals, which serve as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibit a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular and Photocrosslinked Interpenetrating Network Hydrogel Matrices for 3D&#8208;Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[8]uril mediated interpenetrating network (IPN) supramolecular hydrogels with tunable chemical and physical crosslink densities are prepared for applications as dynamic biomaterial inks. By mixing functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with CB[8], two physical networks are formed. The application of an external light source rapidly and selectively transforms one physical network into a covalent network. The obtained gels show cytocompatibility, printability, and post&#8208;extrusion stability.








Abstract
Printing of biologically functional constructs is significant for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Designing bioinks remains remarkably challenging due to the multifaceted requirements in terms of the physical, chemical, and biochemical properties of the three&#8208;dimensional matrix, such as cytocompatibility, printability, and shape fidelity. In order to promote matrix and materials stiffness, while not sacrificing stress relaxation mechanisms which support cell spreading, migration, and differentiation, this work reports an interpenetrating network (IPN) bioink design. The approach makes use of a chemically defined network, combining physical and chemical crosslinking units with a tunable composition and network density, as well as spatiotemporal control over post&#8208;assembly material stiffening. To this end, star&#8208;shaped poly(ethylene glycol)s functionalized with Phe&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide or photoactive stilbazolium are synthesized, and used to prepare three&#8208;dimensional networks with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) through supramolecular host&#8211;guest complexation. The hydrogel obtained shows fast relaxation and thus supports the proliferation and differentiation of cells. Upon irradiation, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel can be rapidly adapted via selective photochemical dimerization of stilbazolium within CB[8], leading to IPNs with increased form stability while retaining the dynamic nature of the hydrogels. This modular approach opens new design opportunities for extrudable and cell&#8208;friendly dynamic biomaterials for applications in 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Rational Design of Dynamic Interface Water Evolution on Turing Electrocatalyst toward the Industrial Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an asymmetric atomic electric field at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network inherent in the electrolyte and thus manipulate the structure of H2O molecules and the dissociation process. Continuous replenishment of free H2O molecules and smaller H2O dissociation energy barrier ensures FeNiRu/C's exceptional hydrogen evolution activity (166.2 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 187.1 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2 in seawater) at industrial current density.








Abstract
Manipulating the structural and kinetic dissociation processes of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface is vital for alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at industrial current density. This is seldom actualized due to the intricacies of the electrochemical reaction interface. Herein, this work introduces a rapid, nonequilibrium cooling technique for synthesizing ternary Turing catalysts with short&#8208;range ordered structures (denoted as FeNiRu/C). These advanced structures empower the FeNiRu/C to exhibit excellent HER performance in 1 m KOH with an ultralow overpotential of 6.5 and 166.2 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and a specific activity 7.3 times higher than that of Pt/C. Comprehensive mechanistic analyses reveal that abundant atomic species form asymmetric atomic electric fields on the catalyst surface inducing a directed evolution and the dissociation process of interfacial H2O molecules. In addition, the locally topologized structure effectively mitigates the high hydrogen coverage of the active site induced by the high current density. The establishment of the relationship between free water population and HER activity provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high performance alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>2D Conjugated Polymer Thin Films for Organic Electronics: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, tailored electronic properties, and ordered structure have attracted extensive attention in organic electronics. This review summarises the recent advances in interfacial synthesis strategies, conductivity properties, and organic electronics applications of 2DCP thin films. Design principles and future research direction for full&#8208;conjugated 2DCP thin films for organic electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugated lattice and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with predesignability, well&#8208;defined channels, easy postmodification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics is summarized. Furthermore, it is shown that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with predesigned active groups, highly ordered structures, and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin&#8208;film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors. Finally, the future research directions and perspectives of 2DCPs are discussed in terms of the interfacial synthetic design and structure engineering for the fabrication of fully conjugated 2DCP thin films, as well as the functional manipulation of conductivity to advance their applications in future organic electronics.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels with Fibrillar Connected Double Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with low plastic deformations based on fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN) are presented. The efficient transfer of stress between the polyacrylamide and agarose fibril networks via chemical crosslinks and better fibril alignment under stretch result in high fracture strength and toughness (55 MJ m&#8722;3). The fc&#8208;DN provides a new toughening strategy and application potential for load&#8208;bearing soft devices.








Abstract
Biological tissues, such as tendons or cartilage, possess high strength and toughness with very low plastic deformations. In contrast, current strategies to prepare tough hydrogels commonly utilize energy dissipation mechanisms based on physical bonds that lead to irreversible large plastic deformations, thus limiting their load&#8208;bearing applications. This article reports a strategy to toughen hydrogels using fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN), which consist of two distinct but chemically interconnected polymer networks, that is, a polyacrylamide network and an acrylated agarose fibril network. The fc&#8208;DN design allows efficient stress transfer between the two networks and high fibril alignment during deformation, both contributing to high strength and toughness, while the chemical crosslinking ensures low plastic deformations after undergoing high strains. The mechanical properties of the fc&#8208;DN network can be readily tuned to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 8 MPa and a toughness of above 55 MJ m&#8722;3, which is 3 and 3.5 times more than that of fibrillar double network hydrogels without chemical connections, respectively. The application potential of the fc&#8208;DN hydrogel is demonstrated as load&#8208;bearing damping material for a jointed robotic lander. The fc&#8208;DN design provides a new toughening mechanism for hydrogels that can be used for soft robotics or bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Overcoming the Incompatibility between Electrical Conductivity and Electromagnetic Transmissivity: A Graphene Glass Fiber Fabric Design Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional conductive materials such as metals are crucial functional components of conductive systems in diverse electronic instruments. However, their severe intrinsic impedance mismatch with the air dielectric causes strong reflection of the incident electromagnetic waves, and the resulting low electromagnetic transmissivity typically interferes with the surrounding electromagnetic signal communications in modern multifunction&#8208;integrated instruments. In this study, a graphene glass fiber fabric (GGFF) that merged the intrinsic electrical and electromagnetic properties of graphene with the dielectric attributes and highly porous macrostructure of a glass fiber fabric (GFF) was innovatively developed. Using a novel decoupling chemical vapor deposition graphene growth strategy, high&#8208;quality and layer&#8208;limited graphene was prepared on a noncatalytic nonmetallic GFF in a controlled manner; this was pivotal to realizing the GGFF with the desired compatibility between high conductivity, low electromagnetic reflectivity, and high electromagnetic transmissivity. At the same sheet resistance over a wide range of values (250&#8211;3000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), the GGFF exhibited significantly lower electromagnetic reflectivity (by 0.42&#8211;0.51) and higher transmissivity (by 0.27&#8211;0.62) than those of its metal&#8208;based conductive counterpart (Cu&#8208;coated GFF). The material design strategy reported herein provides a constructive solution to eliminate the incompatibility between electrical conductivity and electromagnetic transmissivity faced by conventional conductive materials, spotlighting the applicability of the GGFF in electric heating scenarios in radar, antenna, and stealth systems.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes and Minor Concentration Quenching: Achieving High&#8208;Performance Nondoped and Doped Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneously achieving a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), ultra&#8208;short exciton lifetime and suppressed concentration quenching in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials is desirable yet challenging. Here, we report a novel acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF emitter, namely 2BO&#8208;sQA, wherein two oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron (BO) acceptors are arranged with cofacial alignment and positioned nearly orthogonal to the rigid dispirofluorene&#8208;quinolinoacridine (sQA) donor. This molecular design enables the compound to achieve highly efficient (PLQYs up to 99%) and short&#8208;lived (nanosecond&#8208;scale) blue TADF with effectively suppressed concentration quenching in films. Consequently, the doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) base on 2BO&#8208;sQA achieve exceptional electroluminescence performance across a broad range of doping concentrations, maintaining maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) at over 30% for doping concentrations ranging from 10 wt% to 70 wt%. Remarkably, the nondoped blue OLED achieves a record&#8208;high maximum EQE of 26.6% with a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.0% at 1000 candelas per square meter. By employing 2BO&#8208;sQA as the sensitizer for the multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue emission. These results demostrate the feasibility of this molecular design in developing TADF emitters with high efficiency, ultra&#8208;short exciton lifetime, and minimal concentration quenching.

         <title>Hierarchical Piezoelectric Composites for Non&#8208;invasive Continuous Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and multiparametric analysis of cardiac functions are crucial for the early diagnosis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. However, existing monitoring approaches often suffer from bulky and intrusive apparatus, cumbersome testing procedures, and challenging data processing, hampering their applications in continuous monitoring. Here, w e introduce a heterogeneously hierarchical piezoelectric composite for wearable continuous BP and cardiac function monitoring, overcoming the rigidity of ceramic and the insensitivity of polymer. By optimizing the hierarchical structure and components of the composite, the developed piezoelectric sensor delivers impressive performances, ensuring continuous and accurate monitoring of BP at Grade A level. Furthermore, the haemodynamic parameters are extracted from the detected signals, such as local pulse wave velocity, cardiac output and stroke volume, all of which are in alignment with clinical results. Finally, the all&#8208;day tracking of cardiac function parameters validates the reliability and stability of the developed sensor, highlighting its potential for personalized healthcare systems, particularly in early diagnosis and timely intervention of cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Modulating Intracellular Dynamics for Optimized Intracellular Release and Transcytosis Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Active transcytosis&#8208;mediated nanomedicine transport presents considerable potential in overcoming diverse delivery barriers, thereby facilitating tumor accumulation and penetration. Nevertheless, the persistent challenge lies in achieving a nuanced equilibrium between intracellular interception for drug release and transcytosis for tumor penetration. In this study, a comprehensive exploration was conducted involving a series of polyglutamine&#8208;paclitaxel conjugates featuring distinct hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios (HHR) and tertiary amine&#8208;oxide proportions (TP). The screening process, meticulously focused on delineating their subcellular distribution, transcytosis capability, and tumor penetration, unveiled a particularly promising candidate denoted as OPPX, characterized by an HHR of 10:1 and a TP of 100%. OPPX, distinguished by its rapid cellular internalization through multiple endocytic pathways, selectively engaged in trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis to facilitate accumulation within and penetration throughout tumor tissues and simultaneously sorted to lysosomes for cathepsin B&#8208;activated drug release. This study not only identifies OPPX as an exemplary nanomedicine but also underscores the feasibility of modulating subcellular distribution to optimize the active transport capabilities and intracellular release mechanisms of nanomedicines, providing an alternative approach to designing efficient anticancer nanomedicines.

Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano&#8208;confined in situ solidification was proposed to create a novel category of molten guest&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;organic frameworks, named MGM&#8208;MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML20) into the nanocages of anionic MOF&#8208;OH, MGM&#8208;MOF&#8208;OH, characterized by multi&#8208;modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano&#8208;channels, was achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li+ between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li+ conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8208;MOF&#8208;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kganode + cathode + electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8208;MOF&#8208;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid-state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano-confined in situ solidification was proposed to create a novel category of molten guest-mediated metal-organic frameworks, named MGM-MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) into the nanocages of anionic MOF-OH, MGM-MOF-OH, characterized by multi-modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano-channels, was achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl-functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM-MOF-OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;anode + cathode + electrolyte&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM-MOF-OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organizing Photosensitive and Photothermal Single&#8208;Sites Uniformly in a Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Abstract
Effective combination of the photosensitivity and photothermal capacity in photocatalyst is vital to achieve the maximum light utilization for superior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we successfully organize photosensitive Cd&#8208;NS single&#8208;sites and photothermal Ni&#8208;NS single&#8208;sites uniformly at a molecular level within a tailored trimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework. The optimized Ho6&#8208;Cd0.76Ni0.24&#8208;NS exhibits a superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 40.06 mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37% at 420&#160;nm without using cocatalysts or photosensitizers. A systematical mechanism study reveals that the uniformly organized photosensitive and photothermal single&#8208;sites have synergistic effect, which form ultrashort pathways for efficient transport of photoinduced electrons, suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, hence promote the hydrogen evolution activity. This work provides a promising approach for organizing dual&#8208;functional single&#8208;sites uniformly in photocatalyst for high&#8208;performance photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Emerging Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic spintronics has gained remarkable development in recent years. In this Perspective, the latest research progress in this field is reviewed. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can endow them with exotic properties for spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets constitute promising contender materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices with superior stability, scalability, and dynamics. Nevertheless, the perception of well&#8208;established ferromagnetic spintronics underpinned by spontaneous magnetization seemed to indicate the inadequacy of antiferromagnets for spintronics&#8212;their compensated magnetization has been perceived to result in uncontrollable antiferromagnetic order and subtle magnetoelectronic responses. However, remarkable advancements have been achieved in antiferromagnetic spintronics in recent years, with consecutive unanticipated discoveries substantiating the feasibility of antiferromagnet&#8208;centered spintronic devices. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can open up their endless possibilities of novel phenomena and functionality for spintronics. In this Perspective, the recent progress in antiferromagnetic spintronics is reviewed, with a particular focus on that based on several kinds of antiferromagnets with special antiferromagnetic crystal structures. The latest developments in efficiently manipulating antiferromagnetic order, exploring novel antiferromagnetic physical responses, and demonstrating prototype antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are discussed. An outlook on future research directions is also provided. It is hoped that this Perspective can serve as guidance for readers who are interested in this field and encourage unprecedented studies on antiferromagnetic spintronic materials, phenomena, and devices.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in 2D PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) is studied in 2D PtSe2 using THz emission. PtSe2 layers are grown epitaxially on graphene, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition resulting in well&#8208;defined atomic interfaces.The unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC: from the inverse RashbaEdelstein effect in the semiconducting layers to the inverse spin Hall effect in the semi&#8208;metallic state.








Abstract
2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field, or strain. Here, SCC in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission is studied since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8211;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE is demonstrated. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC as well as for the development of tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

         <title>Tailored Design of a Water&#8208;Based Nanoreactor Technology for Producing Processable Sub&#8208;40&#160;Nm 3D COF Nanoparticles at Atmospheric Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology that allows for the controlled generation of sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D covalent organic frameworks (COF) nanoparticles, boosting processability, and opening new frontiers in nano/microrobotics and biomedicine is presented. This breakthrough clearly overcomes the limitations posed by larger reported 3D COF crystal structures, unlocking exciting possibilities for previously unexplored domains.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress is made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions is presented. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architectured silicones comprising vitrimer and conventional elastomers are developed to simultaneously achieve creep resistance and autonomic self&#8208;heal at room temperature. Self&#8208;healing capabilities arise from dynamic dioxaborolane groups in the silicone vitrimer, whereas creep resistance emerges from the permanently crosslinked conventional elastomer. The potential of architectured silicones is illustrated by 3D printing a patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers for prospective applications in robotics and medicine.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers are printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage&#8208;resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers are prepared by impregnating porous delignified wood with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with a mismatched refractive index to enhance scattering. The fabrication of laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers is simple, environment&#8208;friendly, and rapid. This low&#8208;cost and highly efficient strategy can provide substantial energy savings and a basis for the application of natural wood in emerging laser diode lighting technology.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, a mismatched refractive index strategy is proposed to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has the potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolyte brushes prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization display pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric behavior. These properties are attributed to the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and depend on, and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing. 








Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Atmospheric Humidity Underlies Irreproducibility of Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric humidity control during the fabrication process crucially influences the phase formation and stability of formamidinium perovskites. This work reveals that controlled humidity during the fabrication process is a key to achieving reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films. Thus, precise humidity management is essential to ensure the reproducible, efficient, and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are infamous for their batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch and lab&#8208;to&#8208;lab irreproducibility in terms of stability and performance. Reproducible fabrication of PSCs is a critical requirement for market viability and practical commercialization. PSC irreproducibility plagues all levels of the community; from institutional research laboratories, start&#8208;up companies, to large established corporations. In this work, the critical function of atmospheric humidity to regulate the crystallization and stabilization of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the humidity content during processing induces profound variations in perovskite stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability, and optoelectronic quality. Almost counterintuitively, it is shown that the presence of humidity is perhaps indispensable to reproduce phase&#8208;stable and efficient FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Way to a Library of Ti&#8208;Series Oxide Nanofiber Sponges that are Highly Stretchable, Compressible, and Bendable</title>

A library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability are synthesized, which hold extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices.








Abstract
Ti&#8208;series oxide ceramics in the form of aerogels, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and CaCu3Ti4O12, hold tremendous potential as functional materials owing to their excellent optical, dielectric, and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, these inorganic aerogels are usually brittle and prone to pulverization owing to weak inter&#8208;particulate interactions, resulting in restricted application performance and serious health risks. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to synthesize an elastic form of an aerogel&#8208;like, highly porous structure, in which activity&#8208;switchable Ti&#8208;series oxide sols transform from the metastable state to the active state during electrospinning, resulting in condensation and solidification at the whipping stage to obtain curled nanofibers. These curled nanofibers are further entangled when flying in the air to form a physically interlocked, elastic network mimicking the microstructure of high&#8208;elasticity hydrogels. This strategy provides a library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability, possessing extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a new, elastic form of TiO2, composed of both &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; TiO2 nanofiber sponges, is constructed as spontaneous air&#8208;conditioning textiles in smart clothing, buildings, and vehicles, with unique bidirectional regulation of radiative cooling in summer and solar heating in winter.

&lt;p&gt;Ti-series oxide ceramics in the form of aerogels, such as TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CaCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, hold tremendous potential as functional materials owing to their excellent optical, dielectric, and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, these inorganic aerogels are usually brittle and prone to pulverization owing to weak inter-particulate interactions, resulting in restricted application performance and serious health risks. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to synthesize an elastic form of an aerogel-like, highly porous structure, in which activity-switchable Ti-series oxide sols transform from the metastable state to the active state during electrospinning, resulting in condensation and solidification at the whipping stage to obtain curled nanofibers. These curled nanofibers are further entangled when flying in the air to form a physically interlocked, elastic network mimicking the microstructure of high-elasticity hydrogels. This strategy provides a library of Ti-series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability, possessing extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a new, elastic form of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, composed of both &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanofiber sponges, is constructed as spontaneous air-conditioning textiles in smart clothing, buildings, and vehicles, with unique bidirectional regulation of radiative cooling in summer and solar heating in winter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with a Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postoperative implantable hydrogel sensor integrating a molecular beacon (MB) nanoprobe and fibroblasts is designed for visual detection and elimination of residual microtumors by ultrasensitive in situ monitoring of trace biomarkers, whose amplification of the signal is achieved by fibroblast&#8208;mediated local enrichment of tumor cells and spatially selective release of exonuclease I (exo I)&#8208;triggered biomarker recycling.








Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, a novel hydrogel sensor is designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detects the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1 in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identifies residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor is proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving &#8776;100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. This work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.








Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design&#8208;build&#8208;test&#8208;learn (DBTL) cycle, the modules are wired according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. A 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that can perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities is designed. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and can be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite membrane with an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and PFPE rubber is fabricated by PFPE precursor diffusion into electrolyte membrane backbone and curing process. The membrane increases the fatigue threshold by a factor of 2.5 compared to Nafion membranes. In the fuel cell test, the composite membrane exhibits a lifespan of 1.7 times longer than Nafion membranes.








Abstract
In a hydrogen fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane conducts protons, but blocks electrons, hydrogen molecules, and oxygen molecules. The fuel cell often runs unsteadily, resulting in fluctuating water production, causing the membrane to swell and contract. The cyclic deformation can cause fatigue crack growth. This paper describes an approach to develop a fatigue&#8208;resistant polymer electrolyte membrane. The membrane is prepared by forming an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and a rubber. The former conducts protons, and the latter enhances fatigue resistance. The introduction of the rubber modestly reduces electrochemical performance, but significantly increases fatigue threshold and lifespan. Compared to pristine plastic electrolyte, Nafion, an interpenetrating network of Nafion and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) reduces the maximum power density by 20%, but increases the fatigue threshold by 175%. Under the wet/dry accelerated stress test, the fuel cell with the Nafion&#8208;PFPE membrane has a lifespan 1.7 times that of a fuel cell with the Nafion membrane.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoid differentiation is largely conducted using biochemical signals to control cell differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signaling regulates nephrogenesis in kidney organoids is investigated. 3D encapsulation of differentiating kidney organoids in viscoelastic alginate hydrogels alters nephron patterning and morphology. These findings suggest that mechanical signaling is an important consideration for kidney regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8211;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz refractive sensing and fingerprint recognition within a continuous spectrum based on the coupling of surface waves. By covering 5 &#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz, and silicon nitride layers, the phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, this strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Hard Magnetic Graphene Nanocomposite for Multimodal, Reconfigurable Soft Electronics</title>

         <dc:description>
The HMGN combines the advantages of porous conductive materials and hard magnetic materials to enable multimodal, reconfigurable soft electronics with magnetism&#8208;enhanced sensing performance and magnetism&#8208;assisted electrical interconnection, allowing for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage.








Abstract
Soft electronics provide effective means for continuous monitoring of a diverse set of biophysical and biochemical signals from the human body. However, the sensitivities, functions, spatial distributions, and many other features of such sensors remain fixed after deployment and cannot be adjusted on demand. Here, laser&#8208;induced porous graphene is exploited as the sensing material, and dope it with permanent magnetic particles to create hard magnetic graphene nanocomposite (HMGN) that can self&#8208;assemble onto a flexible carrying substrate through magnetic force, in a reversible and reconfigurable manner. A set of soft electronics in HMGN exhibits enhanced performances in the measurements of electrophysiological signals, temperature, and concentrations of metabolites. All these flexible HMGN sensors can adhere to a carrying substrate at any position and in any spatial arrangement, to allow for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage. The HMGN represents a promising material for constructing soft electronics that can be reconfigured for various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Adsorption on Magnetic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic helical aromatic hydrocarbons are sublimed in vacuo onto ferromagnetic cobalt nanoislands. Spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy on the single&#8208;molecule scale reveals that molecules of opposite handedness preferentially adsorb on islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. Enantioselection occurs in a transiently occupied physisorbed precursor state, suggesting that spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive interactions at the van der Waals level play a role.








Abstract
From the beginning of molecular theory, the interplay of chirality and magnetism has intrigued scientists. There is still the question if enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules occurs on magnetic surfaces. Enantiomer discrimination was&#160;conjectured to arise from chirality&#8208;induced spin separation within the molecules and exchange interaction with the substrate's magnetization. Here, it is shown that single helical aromatic hydrocarbons undergo enantioselective adsorption on ferromagnetic cobalt surfaces. Spin and chirality sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that molecules of opposite handedness prefer adsorption onto cobalt islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. As mobility ceases in the final chemisorbed state, it is concluded that enantioselection must occur in a physisorbed transient precursor state. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;resolved ab initio simulations support this scenario by refuting enantio&#8208;dependent chemisorption energies. These findings demonstrate that van der Waals interaction should also include spin&#8208;fluctuations which are crucial for molecular magnetochiral&#160;processes.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Capture through Ligand&#8208;Chain Interaction for the Regeneration of Depleted LiFePO4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the ligand chain within the Zn complex dynamically modulates the variational structure, enlarging the main framework of LFP and expediting the de&#8208;intercalation of Li+. This process revitalizes the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP, restoring them to levels comparable to that of newly produced LFP even under severe degradation conditions during the operation of regenerated batteries.








Abstract
After application in electric vehicles, spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are typically decommissioned. Traditional recycling methods face economic and environmental constraints. Therefore, direct regeneration has emerged as a promising alternative. However, irreversible phase changes can significantly hinder the efficiency of the regeneration process owing to structural degradation. Moreover, improper storage and treatment practices can lead to metamorphism, further complicating the regeneration process. In this study, a sustainable recovery method is proposed for the electrochemical repair of LFP batteries. A ligand&#8208;chain Zn&#8208;complex (ZnDEA) is utilized as a structural regulator, with its &#9472;NH&#9472; group alternatingly facilitating the binding of preferential transition metal ions (Fe3+ during charging and Zn2+ during discharging). This dynamic coordination ability helps to modulate volume changes within the recovered LFP framework. Consequently, the recovered LFP framework can store more Li&#8208;ions, enhance phase transition reversibility between LFP and FePO4 (FP), modify the initial Coulombic efficiency, and reduce polarization voltage differences. The recovered LFP cells exhibit excellent capacity retention of 96.30% after 1500 cycles at 2&#160;C. The ligand chain repair mechanism promotes structural evolution to facilitate ion migration, providing valuable insights into the targeted ion compensation for environmentally friendly recycling in practical applications.

         <title>Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phosphonic acid is developed to modify Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable device stability.








Abstract
High efficiency and long&#8208;term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non&#8208;uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic&#8208;acid structure, indolo(3,2&#8208;b)carbazole&#8208;5,11&#8208;diylbis(butane&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ&#8208;based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed similar to traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, including active material, conductive agent, and binder. Using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a hybrid target containing SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene, a thin&#8208;film SiOx&#8208;based composite electrode is successfully fabricated within plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). The SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film exhibits improved electronic conductivity, elasticity, and hardness compared to pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film shows remarkable cycling stability.








Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques is crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film is produced using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene. The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC (plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon) involves a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the PPFC matrix. This results in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibits an exceptional initial capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a stepping stone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF&#8208;LIBs.

         <title>B&#8208;Site Co&#8208;Doping Coupled with Additive Passivation Pushes the Efficiency of Pb&#8211;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells with a record efficiency of 17.12% are achieved via B&#8208;site Mn co&#8208;doping strategy and introducing benzhydroxamic acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. Mn&#8208;doping contributes to structurally stable inorganic perovskite. While, BHA additive mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, and passivates Sn(II) related defects, forming an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite.








Abstract
Pb&#8211;Sn mixed inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increasing interest as a viable solution to mitigate the thermal instability and lead toxicity of hybrid lead&#8208;based PSCs. However, the relatively poor structural stability and low device efficiency hinder its further development. Herein, high&#8208;performance manganese (Mn)&#8208;doped Pb&#8211;Sn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are successfully developed by introducing Benzhydroxamic Acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. The incorporation of smaller divalent Mn cations contributes to a contraction of the perovskite crystal, leading to an improvement in structural stability. The BHA additive containing a reductive hydroxamic acid group (O&#9552;C&#8211;NHOH) not only mitigates the notorious oxidation of Sn2+ but also interacts with metal ions at the B&#8208;site and passivates related defects. This results in films with high crystallinity and low defect density. Moreover, the BHA molecules tend to introduce a near&#8208;vertical dipole moment that parallels the built&#8208;in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, the resulting device delivers a champion PCE as high as 17.12%, which represents the highest reported efficiency for Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the BHA molecule provides an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain boundary, resulting in significant enhancement of device air stability.

         <title>Piezoelectric Interlayer Enabling a Rechargeable Quasisolid&#8208;State Sodium Battery at 0&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric interlayer design between an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte and sodium metal is demonstrated to solve the interfacial issues against low&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. A piezoelectric ZnO layer proves a favorable interlayer with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, sufficient piezoelectricity to thoroughly reduce the interfacial resistance and promote a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell operating at a harsh condition of 0 &#176;C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) batteries (SSNBs) hold great promise but suffer from several major issues, such as high interfacial resistance at the solid electrolyte/electrode interface and Na metal dendrite growth. To address these issues, a piezoelectric interlayer design for an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolyte is proposed herein. Two typical piezoelectric films, AlN and ZnO, coated onto NZSP function as interlayers designed to generate a local stress&#8208;induced field for alleviating interfacial charge aggregation coupling stress concentration and promoting uniform Na plating. The results reveal that the interlayer (ZnO) with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, and sufficient piezoelectricity can provide a favorable interphase. Low interfacial resistances of 91 and 239 &#937; cm2 are achieved for the ZnO layer at 30 and 0&#160;&#176;C, respectively, which are notably lower than those for bare NZSP. Moreover, steady Na plating/stripping cycles are rendered over 850 and 4900&#160;h at 0 and 30&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The superior anodic performance is further manifested in an Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell which delivers discharge capacities of 125&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 1600 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 90&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 0&#160;&#176;C. A new interlayer&#8208;design insight is clearly demonstrated for SSNBs breaking low&#8208;temperature limits.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Electrocatalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free pathway for synthesizing metal&#8208;containing porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks (MPOR&#8208;COFs) is presented. The roles of synthetic conditions and the transition metals chelating with porphyrin are highlighted through both experimental and computational works. This study sets forth a unique approach to the synthesis and integration of electrocatalysts into electrode architectures, propelling applications into the cutting&#8208;edge realm.








Abstract
The inability to process many covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as thin films plagues their widespread utilization. Herein, a vapor&#8208;phase pathway for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a class of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs is presented. This approach allows integrating electrocatalysts made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;containing COFs into the electrodes&#8217; architectures in a single&#8208;step synthesis and deposition. By precisely controlling the metal sites at the atomic level, remarkable electrocatalytic performance is achieved, resulting in unprecedentedly high mass activity values. How the choice of metal atoms, i.e., cobalt and copper, can determine the catalytic activities of POR&#8208;COFs is demonstrated. The theoretical data proves that the Cu site is highly active for nitrate conversion to ammonia on the synthesized COFs.

By precisely controlling the metal sites at the atomic level, remarkable electrocatalytic performance is achieved, resulting in unprecedentedly high mass activity values. How the choice of metal atoms, i.e., cobalt and copper, can determine the catalytic activities of POR-COFs is demonstrated. The theoretical data proves that the Cu site is highly active for nitrate conversion to ammonia on the synthesized COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.








Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in the Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral medications for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) encounter challenges of insufficient drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. A high&#8208;performance gold shell&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutic is constructed to achieve mucus penetration, improve wound healing, relieve oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses under transient mild photothermia. Oral hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating nanotherapeutics plus transient mild photothermia efficiently alleviates acute and chronic UC.








Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8776;42&#160;&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitates their penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Excitable AIE Small Molecule with Multimodal Phototheranostic Features for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR&#8208;II light activatable AIE small molecule with multimodal phototheranostic features is constructed for the first time by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility, as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. This molecule actualizes prominent NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8208;PTT synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics, referring to a single component simultaneously exhibiting multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities, has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in cancer treatment. Benefitting from the superiority in balancing the diverse competing energy dissipation pathways, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are proven to be ideal templates for constructing one&#8208;for&#8208;all multimodal phototheranostic agents. However, to this knowledge, the all&#8208;round AIEgens that can be triggered by a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) light have not been reported. Given the deep tissue penetration and high maximum permissible exposure of the NIR&#8208;II excitation light, herein, this work reports for the first time an NIR&#8208;II laser excitable AIE small molecule (named BETT&#8208;2) with multimodal phototheranostic features by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. As formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), the high performance of BETT&#8208;2 NPs in NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors is fully demonstrated by the systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations. This work offers valuable insights for developing NIR&#8208;II laser activatable one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic systems.

         <title>Efficient Thermo&#8208;Spin Conversion in van der Waals Ferromagnet FeGaTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermo&#8208;spin conversion has been found in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe. The unique thermoelectric property, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient, produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature. The maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient is found to reach 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 with a notable Nernst angle over 60%. 








Abstract
Recent discovery of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has spurred progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in enhancing the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency for building spin&#8208;logic or spin&#8208;memory devices. Here, the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects are systematically investigated to uncover significant spin&#8208;conversion effects in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anomalous Hall effect demonstrates an efficient electric spin&#8208;charge conversion with a notable spin Hall angle of over 6%. In addition, the anomalous Nernst effect produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature without a magnetic field, displaying unique temperature dependence with a maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient of 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 and a Nernst angle of &#8776;62%. Such an innovative thermoelectric signal arises from the efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion effect, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient. The present study highlights the potential of FeGaTe to enhance thermoelectric devices through efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion without the need for a magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Light Debondable Optically Clear Adhesives for Flexible Displays through Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Curing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;removable optically clear adhesive (OCA) is introduced, ideal for the sustainability&#8208;focused electronics industry, particularly for foldable devices requiring easy disassembly and robust, eco&#8208;friendly materials.








Abstract
With growing sustainability concerns, the need for products that facilitate easy disassembly and reuse has increased. Adhesives, initially designed for bonding, now face demands for selective removal, enabling rapid assembly&#8208;disassembly and efficient maintenance across industries. This need is particularly evident in the display industry, with the rise of foldable devices necessitating specialized adhesives. A novel optically clear adhesive (OCA) is presented for foldable display, featuring a unique UV&#8208;stimulated selective removal feature. This approach incorporates benzophenone derivatives into the polymer network, facilitating rapid debonding under UV irradiation. A key feature of this method is the adept use of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical polymerization for OCA film fabrication. This method shows remarkable compatibility with various monomers and exhibits orthogonal reactivity to benzophenone, rendering it ideal for large&#8208;scale production. The resultant OCA not only has high transparency and balanced elasticity, along with excellent resistance to repeated folding, but it also exhibits significantly reduced adhesion when exposed to UV irradiation. By merging this customized formulation with strategically integrated UV&#8208;responsive elements, an effective solution is offered that enhances manufacturing efficiency and product reliability in the rapidly evolving field of sustainable electronics and displays. This research additionally contributes to eco&#8208;friendly device fabrication, aligning with emerging technology demands.

         <title>How to Build Plasmon&#8208;Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular jackhammers (MJH) are a type of molecular machine driven by a molecular plasmon that converts photons into mechanical energy. The theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here these are quantified through an experimental plasmonicity index method. This method is utilized to understand how to improve plasmon&#8208;driven MJH for permeabilizing cellular membranes.








Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;driven molecular machines with ultrafast motion at the femtosecond scale are effective for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is recently shown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through vibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that causes the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted whole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here the use of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated plasmons in a broad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and cytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The characteristics of plasmon&#8208;driven molecular mechanical disassembly of supramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using real&#8208;time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in MJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method. This is done through the measurement of the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR spectra in various solvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the solvent polarity. Structure&#8208;activity relationships are used to optimize the synthesis of plasmon&#8208;driven MJH, applying them to eradicate human melanoma A375 cells at low lethal concentrations of 75&#160;nm and 80&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of 730&#160;nm NIR&#8208;light for 10&#160;min.

         <title>Observation of a Photonic Orbital Gauge Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step toward generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.








Abstract
Gauge field is widely studied in natural and artificial materials. With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena are observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices is first proposed and experimentally observed. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937; created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) l = 2 are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Rewritable Photoluminescence and Structural Color Display for Dual&#8208;Responsive Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independently and reliably manipulated in the thin polymer&#8208;based film. A rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display that has the benefit of direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye is presented, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Optical encryption using coloration and photoluminescent (PL) materials can provide highly secure data protection with direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information. Encryption capable of independently controlling wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration as well as variable light intensity PL is not adequately demonstrated yet. Herein, a rewritable PL and structural color (SC) display suitable for dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption developed with a stimuli&#8208;responsive SC of a block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) with alternating in&#8208;plane lamellae, of which a variety of 3D and 2D perovskite nanocrystals is preferentially self&#8208;assembled with characteristic PL, is presented. The SC of a BCP PC is controlled in the visible range with different perovskite precursor doping times. The perovskite nanocrystals developed in the BCP PC are highly luminescent, with a PL quantum yield of &#8776;33.7%, yielding environmentally stable SC and PL dual&#8208;mode displays. The independently programmed SC and PL information is erasable and rewritable. Dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption is demonstrated, in which true Morse code information is deciphered only when the information encoded by SCs is properly combined with PL information. Numerous combinations of SC and PL realize high security level of data anticounterfeiting. This dual&#8208;mode encryption display offers novel optical encryption with high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Localization of Cancer Cells for Subsequent Robust Photodynamic Therapy by ROS Responsive Polymeric Nanoparticles With Anti&#8208;Metastasis Complexes NAMI&#8208;A</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most cancer&#8208;related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple&#8208;negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non&#8208;resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen&#8208;dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti&#8208;metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI&#8208;A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.

NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Angular Engineering Strategy for Enhanced Surface Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Centrosymmetric Topological Semimetal HfGe0.92Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonlinearity is essential for integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. Topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te possesses a giant surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility and exhibits unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) based on an angular engineering strategy. Moreover, this high&#8208;performance SHG response is observed ranging from the visible to deep&#8208;UV regions because of the wide linear dispersion region around the Dirac points.








Abstract
Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic&#8208;layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, it is demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535 &#177; 308&#160;pm V&#8722;1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency is found to be up to 3.75&#8240;, which is 104 times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779&#160;nm) to the deep&#8208;UV region (257.5&#160;nm). This study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

         <title>Capacitive&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Scaffolds Offering Wireless In Situ Electrical Stimulation Promotes Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the capacitive coupling configuration, the electrostatic induction response of the chitosan/gelatin/black phosphorus conductive hydrogel implanted in the spinal cord injury lesion site can offer in situ electrical stimulation without any external metal stimulation electrodes and percutaneous electrical wirings. The capacitive coupling of high&#8208;frequency electrical field between hydrogel receiver and insulated metal patch transmitter can generate alternating current flowing in the hydrogel scaffold.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation (ES) has shown beneficial effects in repairing injured tissues. However, current ES techniques that use tissue&#8208;traversing leads and bulky external power suppliers have significant limitations in translational medicine. Hence, exploring noninvasive in vivo ES to provide controllable electrical cues in tissue engineering is an imminent necessity. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with in situ electrical generation capability as a biodegradable regeneration scaffold and wireless ES platform for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair is demonstrated. When a soft insulated metal plate is placed on top of the injury site as a wireless power transmitter, the conductive hydrogel implanted at the injury site can serve as a wireless power receiver, and the capacitive coupling between the receiver and transmitter can generate an alternating current in the hydrogel scaffold owing to electrostatic induction effect. In a complete transection model of SCI rats, the implanted conductive hydrogels with capacitive&#8208;coupling in situ ES enhance functional recovery and neural tissue repair by promoting remyelination, accelerating axon regeneration, and facilitating endogenous neural stem cell differentiation. This facile wireless&#8208;powered electroactive&#8208;hydrogel strategy thus offers on&#8208;demand in vivo ES with an adjustable timeline, duration, and strength and holds great promise in translational medicine.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By balancing injected electrons and holes, and electrically confining neutral excitons, WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing efficiency and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the 1D region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. These experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Surface&#8208;Mediated Mechanochemical Reaction for Rapid and Scalable Manufacture of Perovskite QD Phosphors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare highly luminescent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for the first time. PMR possesses distinctive features, including a high material utilization rate (100%), rapid synthesis (&#8776;100 s), mass production (synthesis rate of 1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), solvent&#8208;free, and remarkable versatility in preparing various perovskites, aligning with the ultimate goal of mechanochemistry: A clean, safe, and efficient solvent&#8208;free strategy.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered new&#8208;generation emitters for lighting and displays due to their high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, and pure color. However, their commercialization process is currently hindered by the challenge of mass production in a quick and environmentally friendly manner. In this study, a polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) is proposed to prepare perovskite QDs using a high&#8208;speed multifunction grinder for the first time. PMR possesses two distinctive features: i) The ultra&#8208;high rotating speed (&gt;15&#8239;000&#160;rpm) of the grinder facilitates the rapid conversion of the precursor to perovskite; ii) The surface&#8208;rich polymer particulate ensures QDs with high dispersity, avoiding QD aggregation&#8208;induced PL quenching. Therefore, PMR can successfully manufacture green perovskite QDs with a high PL quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 90% in a highly material&#8208; (100% yield), time&#8208; (1&#160;kg&#160;min&#8722;1), and effort&#8208; (solvent&#8208;free) efficient manner. Moreover, the PMR demonstrates remarkable versatility, including synthesizing by various polymers and producing diverse colored and Pb&#8208;free phosphors. Importantly, these phosphors featuring a combination of polymer and perovskite, are facilely processed into various solid emitters. The proposed rapid, green, and scalable approach has great potential to accelerate the commercialization of perovskite QDs.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis inside Double&#8208;Shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages with separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites are developed as nano reactors to trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides. These nanocages can serve as multifunctional sulfur hosts for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, guaranteeing admirable rate performance and high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8208;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8208;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8208;N4 and outer Zn&#8208;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8208;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proton Conductor for Fuel Cells with Flexible Operational Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A developed dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid exhibits efficient and stable proton conductivity over 80&#8211;160 &#176;C owing to the strong interaction between the two proton conductors and enhanced proton dissociation, enabling fuel cell operation with a flexible temperature range and excellent stability.








Abstract
The properties of proton conductors determine the operating temperature range of fuel cells. Typically, phosphoric acid (PA) proton conductors exhibit excellent proton conductivity owing to their high proton dissociation and self&#8208;diffusion abilities. However, at low temperatures or high current densities, water&#8208;induced PA loss causes rapid degradation of cell performance. Maintaining efficient and stable proton conductivity within a flexible temperature range can significantly reduce the start&#8208;up temperature of PA&#8208;doped proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of an organic phosphonic acid (ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, EDTMPA) and an inorganic PA is developed for proton exchange membranes. The proposed dual&#8208;proton conductor can operate within a flexible temperature range of 80&#8211;160 &#176;C, benefiting from the strong interaction between EDTMPA and PA, and the enhanced proton dissociation. Fuel cells with the EDTMPA&#8208;PA dual&#8208;proton conductor showed excellent cell stability at 80 &#176;C. In particular, under the high current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 160 &#176;C, the voltage decay rate of the fuel cell with the dual&#8208;proton conductor is one&#8208;thousandth of that of the fuel cell with PA&#8208;only proton conductor, indicating excellent stability.

         <title>Upconversion 3D Bioprinting for Noninvasive In Vivo Molding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel technique for creating implantable medical devices using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting. By converting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons into blue&#8211;violet emission, UCNPs enable in vivo polymerization without invasive surgery. Successful 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold demonstrates the potential of this method for biomedical treatment.








Abstract
Tissue engineered bracket materials provide essential support for the physiological protection and therapeutics of patients. Unfortunately, the implantation process of such devices poses the risk of surgical complications and infection. In this study, an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting approach is developed to realize in vivo molding that is free from invasive surgery. Reasonably designed UCNPs, which convert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons that penetrate skin tissues into blue&#8211;violet emission (300&#8211;500 nm), induce a monomer polymerization curing procedure in vivo. Using a fused deposition modeling coordination framework, a precisely predetermined trajectory of the NIR laser enables the manufacture of implantable medical devices with tailored shapes. A proof of the 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold is achieved successfully, thus demonstrating an entirely new method of in vivo molding for biomedical treatment.

         <title>Inhibition of Vanadium Cathodes Dissolution in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathode dissolution significantly limits the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, particularly at low currents. An artificial constructed on V6O13 cathodes (ZnOTf&#8208;LDH) is revealed to repel water, impede vanadium shuttling, and facilitate zinc transport. This suppresses vanadium dissolution and enables stable cycling for over 200 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1. The method is applicable to different vanadium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have experienced a rapid surge in popularity, as evident from the extensive research with over 30 000 articles published in the past 5 years. Previous studies on AZIBs have showcased impressive long&#8208;cycle stability at high current densities, achieving thousands or tens of thousands of cycles. However, the practical stability of AZIBs at low current densities (&lt;1C) is restricted to merely 50&#8211;100 cycles due to intensified cathode dissolution. This genuine limitation poses a considerable challenge to their transition from the laboratory to the industry. In this study, leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an artificial interphase that achieves both hydrophobicity and restriction of the outward penetration of dissolved vanadium cations, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium and suppressing the vanadium dissolution following Le Chatelier's principle, is described. The approach has resulted in one of the best cycling stabilities to date, with no noticeable capacity fading after more than 200 cycles (&#8776;720&#160;h) at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.47C). These findings represent a significant advance in the design of ultrastable cathodes for aqueous batteries and accelerate the industrialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reduced Lattice Constant in Al&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Nanoparticles for Boosted Electrochemical Lithium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>

Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al&#8208;doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al&#8208;doped LMO (LiAl0.05Mn1.95O4, LMO&#8208;Al0.05) exhibits highercapacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li+ diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 obtains a Li+ intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh&#160;mol&#8722;1 Li+. Importantly, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 achieves a high Li+ extraction percentage (&#8776;86%) with Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine.

&lt;p&gt;Al-doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al-doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one-step solid-state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al-doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al-doped LMO (LiAl&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.95&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, LMO-Al0.05) exhibits highercapacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO-Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO-Al0.05 obtains a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Importantly, the LMO-Al0.05 achieves a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; extraction percentage (&#8776;86%) with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine. The results demonstrate that the Al-doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Li2S Cathodes Enabled by an In Situ&#8208;Formed Li+ Conductor for Graphite&#8208;Li2S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed Li+ conductor (Li4SnS4) layer is directly constructed on commercial Li2S particles to obtain air&#8208;stable, shuttle&#8208;free, and fast&#8208;redox Li2S cathodes for graphite&#8208;Li2S batteries.








Abstract
Using Li2S cathodes instead of S cathodes presents an opportunity to pair them with Li&#8208;free anodes (e.g., graphite), thereby circumventing anode&#8208;related issues, such as poor reversibility and safety, encountered in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, the moisture&#8208;sensitive nature of Li2S causes the release of hazardous H2S and the formation of insulative by&#8208;products, increasing the manufacturing difficulty and adversely affecting cathode performance. Here, Li4SnS4, a Li+ conductor that is air&#8208;stable according to the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle, is formed in situ and uniformly on Li2S particles because Li2S itself participates in Li4SnS4 formation. When exposed to air (20% relative humidity), the protective Li4SnS4 layer maintains its components and structure, thus contributing to the enhanced stability of the Li2S@Li4SnS4 composite. In addition, the Li4SnS4 layer can accelerate the sluggish conversion of Li2S because of its favorable interfacial charge transfer, and continuously confine lithium polysulfides owing to its integrity during electrochemical processes. A graphite&#8208;Li2S pouch cell containing a Li2S@Li4SnS4 cathode is constructed, which shows stable cyclability with 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Hence, combining a desirable air&#8208;stable Li2S cathode and a highly reversible Li&#8208;free configuration offers potential practical applications of graphite&#8208;Li2S full cells.

         <title>In Situ Reconstruction of High&#8208;Entropy Heterostructure Catalysts for Stable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cr&#8208;induced in situ reconstruction strategy is proposed to construct robust FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts for highly stable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Benefiting from its desired electronic states, the FeCoNiMnCr HEA&#8208;HEO catalyst exhibits negligible activity loss under harsh industrial condition (6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C) at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. 








Abstract
Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, a successful in situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy is reported, and it is demonstrated that they deliver excellent ultrastable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 240&#160;h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 500&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Abstract
The first synthesis and comprehensive characterization of two vinyl tetrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF), TA&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and TA&#8208;COF&#8208;2, are reported. These materials exhibit high crystallinity and high specific surface areas of 1323 and 1114 m2 g&#8722;1. The COFs demonstrate favorable band positions and narrow band gaps suitable for light&#8208;driven applications. These advantages enable TA&#8208;COFs to act as reusable metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in the arylboronic acids oxidation and light&#8208;induced coupling of benzylamines. In addition, these TA&#8208;COFs show acid sensing capabilities, exhibiting visible and reversible color changes upon exposure to HCl&#160;solution, HCl vapor, and NH3 vapor. Further, the TA&#8208;COFs outperform a wide range of previously reported COF photocathodes. The tetrazine linker in the COF skeleton represents a significant advancement in the field of COF synthesis, enhancing the separation efficiency of charge carriers during the photoreaction and contributing to their photocathodic properties. TA&#8208;COFs can also degrade 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;one (NTO), an insensitive explosive present in industrial wastewater, in 20 min in a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic process; thus, revealing dual functionality of the protonated TA&#8208;COFs as both photodegradation and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts. This pioneering work opens new avenues for harnessing the potential of the tetrazine linker in COF&#8208;based materials, facilitating advances in catalysis, sensing, and other related fields.

Abstract
Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) demonstrate a massive potential in constructing lightweight, multifunctional wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields for application in various fields. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop a facile, scalable approach to prepare the MXene&#8208;based macrostructures characterized by low density, low thickness, high mechanical flexibility, and high EMI SE at the same time. Herein, the ultrathin MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag foams with a porifera&#8208;inspired hierarchically porous microstructure are prepared by combining Zn2+ diffusion induction and hard template methods. The hierarchical porosity, which includes a mesoporous skeleton and a microporous MXene network within the skeleton, not only exerts a regulatory effect on stress distribution during compression, making the foams rubber&#8208;like resistant to wrinkling but also provides more channels for multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. Due to the interaction between Ag nanosheets, MXene/rGO, and porous structure, it is possible to produce an outstanding EMI shielding performance with the specific surface shielding effectiveness reaching 109152.4&#160;dB&#160;cm2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the foams exhibit multifunctionalities, such as transverse Joule heating, longitudinal heat insulation, self&#8208;cleaning, fire resistance, and motion detection. These discoveries open up a novel pathway for the development of lightweight MXene&#8208;based materials with considerable application potential in wearable electromagnetic anti&#8208;interference devices.

         <title>Electron Localization&#8208;Triggered Proton Pumping Toward Cu Single Atoms for Electrochemical CO2 Methanation of Unprecedented Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of electron transfer and directional *H transport enabled by electron localization is developed. VBi as an initiator can induce the electron localization at Cu single atoms, which enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 in single&#8208;atom Cu sites for electrocatalytic CH4 synthesis of unprecedented selectivity, apart from acting as active sites of H2O dissociation and pumping proton.








Abstract
Slow multi&#8208;proton coupled electron transfer kinetics and unexpected desorption of intermediates severely hinder the selectivity of CO2 methanation. In this work, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of pumping protons and improving adsorption configuration/capability enabled by electron localization is developed to be highly efficient for CH4 electrosynthesis over Cu single atoms anchored on bismuth vacancies of BiVO4 (Bi1&#8208;xVO4&#9472;Cu), with superior kinetic isotope effect and high CH4 Faraday efficiency (92%), far outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. Control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the bismuth vacancies (VBi) not only act as active sites for H2O dissociation but also induce electron transfer toward Cu single&#8208;atom sites. The VBi&#8208;induced electron localization pumps *H from VBi sites to Cu single atoms, significantly promoting the generation and stabilization of the pivotal intermediate (*CHO) for highly selective CH4 electrosynthesis. The metal vacancies as new initiators show enormous potential in the proton transfer&#8208;involved hydrogenative conversion processes.

         <title>Dynamic Transition between Monomer and Excimer Phosphorescence in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel phosphors are developed by the modification of dithienopyrrole, exhibiting efficient and persistent near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence. At low temperatures, excimer phosphorescence can be activated, enabled by the enhanced noncovalent interactions. With environmental variations, the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence is captured, establishing a framework to understand the photophysical mechanisms governing organic phosphorescence.








Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong nonradiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, is developed. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645 to 702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by noncovalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, the dynamic transition process is captured between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Excited state transitions across varying environments are elucidated, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Comparative Proteomics Inspired Self&#8208;Stimulated Release Hydrogel Reinforces the Therapeutic Effects of MSC&#8208;EVs on Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here an intelligent hydrogel containing self&#8208;assembled peptides that mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (MSC&#8208;EV) membrane enzymes can degrade is developed to allow controlled release of MSC&#8208;EVs after intranasal delivery, prolonging their retention and improving their ability to cure Alzheimer's disease. This study introduces a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven hydrogel design, offering promising modality for MSC&#8208;EVs&#8217; clinical applications.









Abstract
The clinical application of extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#8208;based therapeutics continues to be challenging due to their rapid clearance, restricted retention, and low yields. Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self&#8208;stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self&#8208;assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC&#8208;EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo&#8208;sensitive release of MSC&#8208;EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC&#8208;EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research presents a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven approach to intelligent hydrogel design, which holds the capacity to significantly enhance the applicability of EVs in clinical settings.

         <title>Light and Magnetism Orchestrating Aquatic Pollutant&#8208;Degradation Robots in Programmable Trajectories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film&#8208;confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.








Abstract
Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant&#8208;removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled iron oxide&#8208;bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&#8722;1 within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light&#8208;triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity. This strategy developed here provides guidelines for the explorations of high&#8208;performance smart devices.

Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra-efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant-removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well-assembled iron oxide-bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light-triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity. This strategy developed here provides guidelines for the explorations of high-performance smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ACE2 Receptor&#8208;Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.








Abstract
Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor&#8208;binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug&#8208;targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE&#8208;AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation&#8208;delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild&#8208;type and mutant viruses. The RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (TPCA&#8208;1&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice. This smart combination provides a new choice for dealing with possible emergencies in the future and for the rapid development of inhaled drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases.

         <title>Delineating the Impact of Transition&#8208;Metal Crossover on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation with Ion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals that cross over from the cathode and deposit on the lithium&#8208;metal anode during high&#8208;voltage cycling (4.6&#160;V) are shown to localize solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and lithium deposition on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes through advanced, high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMB) employing cobalt&#8208;free layered&#8208;oxide cathodes are a sustainable path forward to achieving high energy densities, but these cathodes exhibit substantial transition&#8208;metal dissolution during high&#8208;voltage cycling. While transition&#8208;metal crossover is recognized to disrupt solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite anodes, experimental evidence is necessary to demonstrate this for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, advanced high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis is conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) to establish spatial correlations between the transition metals and electrolyte decomposition products found on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Insights into the localization of various chemistries linked to crucial processes that define LMB performance, such as lithium deposition, SEI growth, and transition&#8208;metal deposition are deduced from a precise elemental and spatial analysis of the SEI. Heterogenous transition&#8208;metal deposition is found to perpetuate both heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium deposition on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. These correlations are confirmed across various lithium&#8208;metal anodes that are cycled with different cobalt&#8208;free cathodes and electrolytes. An advanced electrolyte that is stable to higher voltages is shown to minimize transition&#8208;metal crossover and its effects on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining uniform SEI coverage on lithium&#8208;metal anodes, which is disrupted by transition&#8208;metal crossover during operation at high voltages.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;clogging and poor O2 diffusion restrict the output power and capacity of sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Here, by using 3D&#8208;printing techniques, the impact of porous structures and pore sizes on O2 diffusion in sodium&#8208;oxygen cells is studied. An electrode is 3D printed with progressively branching gas channels to balance O2 diffusion and product storage, which shows a high output power and capacity.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D&#8208;printing technology is adopted to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries toward practical applications.

Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host benefits the dendrite&#8208;free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d&#8208;band&#8208;center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p&#8208;band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite&#8208;free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn/S&#8208;PANI full cell also shows a robust long&#8208;term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C may open up their application for the dendrite&#8208;free metal anode.

&lt;p&gt;Dendrite-free Zn metal anodes with high depth-of-discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal-N-C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d-band-center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p-band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite-free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn-N&lt;sub&gt;3Py+1Pr&lt;/sub&gt;-C@Zn/S-PANI full cell also shows a robust long-term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal-N-C may open up their application for the dendrite-free metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong and High Thermal Insulating Porous High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics up to 2000&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiscale design strategy is proposed to fabricate 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diborides (9PHEBs) with exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulating performance via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique. The as&#8208;fabricated 9PHEBs possess ultrahigh compressive strength (&#8776;337 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.76 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). More importantly, they show superior thermal stability and strength retention up to 2000 &#176;C.








Abstract
High mechanical load&#8208;carrying capability and thermal insulating performance are crucial to thermal&#8208;insulation materials under extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics. Here, for the first time, it is reported a multiscale structure design and fast fabrication of 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diboride ceramics via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique that can lead to exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulation performance. With the construction of multiscale structures involving ultrafine pores at the microscale, high&#8208;quality interfaces between building blocks at the nanoscale, and severe lattice distortion at the atomic scale, the materials with an &#8776;50% porosity exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength of up to &#8776;337&#160;MPa at room temperature and a thermal conductivity as low as &#8776;0.76&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. More importantly, they demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, with merely &#8776;2.4% volume shrinkage after 2000&#160;&#176;C annealing. They also show an ultrahigh compressive strength of &#8776;690&#160;MPa up to 2000&#160;&#176;C, displaying a ductile compressive behavior. The excellent mechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Ionic Polyimine&#8208;Based Composite Membrane with Inductive and Complexation Synergistic Effects for Sensitive and On&#8208;Site Fluorescent Detection of Volatile Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concerns about radioactive iodine emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage are raised. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;based method using an ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone composite membrane is developed for on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by utilizing ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions and complexation effects for iodine enrichment and immobilization. The resulting membrane shows rapid response time and low detection limit.








Abstract
Along with the development of nuclear power, concerns about radioactive emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage have been widely raised, particularly of harmful iodine isotopes. However, as a significant component of nuclear air waste, the enrichment and detection of air&#8208;dispersed gaseous iodine remain a challenge. In this work, it is focused on developing an attraction&#8208;immobilization&#8208;detection strategy&#8208;based fluorescence method for the on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by employing a photoluminescent ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone (IPIN&#8208;PVP) composite membrane. This strategy synergizes ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions from IPIN and complexation effects from PVP, allowing effective iodine enrichment and immobilization. As a result, the optimized IPIN&#8208;PVP membrane exhibits rapid response times of 5 s and a low detection limit of 4.087 &#215; 10&#8722;8&#160;m for gaseous iodine. It also introduces a portable handheld detection device that utilizes the composite membrane, offering a practical solution for real&#8208;time on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine. This innovation enhances nuclear safety measures and disaster management by providing rapid and reliable iodine detection capabilities.

         <title>Injectable MSC Spheroid and Microgel Granular Composites for Engineering Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.








Abstract
Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly&#8208;sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long&#8208;term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.

         <title>Defect Engineering of 2D Semiconductors for Dual Control of Emission and Carrier Polarity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations, a general defect engineering strategy is designed to eliminate the negative influence of defects in 2D TMDCs monolayers and achieve the desired optoelectronic properties. The doped samples simultaneously achieve giant PL/PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Further constructed p&#8208;n homojunctions also shows excellent device performance. 








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising materials in post&#8208;Moore technology. However, the low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and single carrier polarity due to the inevitable defects during material preparation are great obstacles to their practical applications. Here, an extraordinary defect engineering strategy is reported based on first&#8208;principles calculations and realize it experimentally on WS2 monolayers by doping with IIIA atoms. The doped samples with large sizes possess both giant PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Surprisingly, the high PL emission maintained even after one year under ambient environment. Moreover, the constructed p&#8211;n homojunctions shows high rectification ratio (&#8776;2200), ultrafast response times and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the doping strategy is universally applicable to other TMDCs and dopants. This smart defect engineering strategy not only provides a general scheme to eliminate the negative influence of defects, but also utilize them to achieve desired optoelectronic properties for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Evolution of Grain Boundaries Promoted Hydrogen Production for Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of grain boundaries via Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo) leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density (0.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.12 V), which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density, is successfully driven. The optimal MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo demonstrates ultrahigh current density (&gt;2 A cm&#8722;2) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;m KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects lead to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell is also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. The strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds&#8208;Pinned Entanglement Blunting the Interfacial Crack of Hydrogel&#8211;Elastomer Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a universal strategy to blunt the interfacial crack propagation by bonding a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomer. Such a unique strategy fulfills the hydrogel coating with excellent interfacial toughness and interfacial fatigue threshold, ensuring long&#8208;term durable aqueous lubrication with a low friction coefficient.








Abstract
Anchoring a layer of amorphous hydrogel on an antagonistic elastomer holds potential applications in surface aqueous lubrication. However, the interfacial crack propagation usually occurs under continuous loads for amorphous hydrogel, leading to the failure of hydrogel interface. This work presents a universal strategy to passivate the interfacial cracks by designing a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomers. The unique Hb&#8211;En structure is created by pinning well&#8208;tailored entanglements via covalent&#8208;like hydrogen bonds, which can amplify the delocalization of interfacial stress concentration and elevate the necessary fracture energy barrier within hydrogel interface. Therefore, the interfacial crack propagation can be suppressed under single and cyclic loads, resulting in a high interfacial toughness over 1650 J m&#8722;2 and an excellent interfacial fatigue threshold of 423 J m&#8722;2. Such a strategy universally works on blunting the interfacial crack between hydrogel coating and various elastomer materials with arbitrary shapes. The superb fatigue&#8208;crack insensitivity at the interface allows for durable aqueous lubrication of hydrogel coating with low friction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Pyroptosis Inducer: Optimizing the Catalytic Microenvironment of Nanozymes by Membrane&#8208;Adhered Microbe Enables Potent Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer to optimize catalytic performance of nanozyme by the respiration of membrane&#8208;adhered microbe, which induces eruptive ROS to trigger pyroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer will motivate the development of self&#8208;adaptive nano&#8208;catalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy and provide new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has garnered increasing attention in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, increasing plasma membrane damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an effective strategy for promoting pyroptosis. However, the current tactics for enhancing membrane rupture in pyroptosis are limited by the inherent drawbacks of ROS and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer (LPZ) is designed by integrating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and an enzyme&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework to achieve potent pyroptosis immunotherapy. LPZ can adhere to cancer cell membranes through the interaction between the pili of LGG and the mucin of cancer cells. In particular, the adaptive formula can gradually enhance the ability of nanozymes to produce ROS by creating an acidic microenvironment through anaerobic respiration. These results verify that LPZ could generate high levels of ROS both on the membrane and within cancer cells, leading to pyroptotic cell death and strong antitumor immunity. Meanwhile, LGG are eventually killed by ROS in this process to halt their respiration and prevent potential biosafety concerns. Overall, this work provides new inspiration for the design of self&#8208;adaptive nanocatalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Biphasic GaIn Alloy Constructed Stable Percolation Network in Polymer Composites over Ultrabroad Temperature Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;eutectic biphasic design of GaIn alloy not only maintains the conductive network integrity at a wide temperature range (77&#8211;473 K) by phase transitions of liquid Ga and solid In but also addresses the widespread leakage problem. This work provides a feasible indication of conductive composites for applications in extreme temperature applications.








Abstract
Flexible and adaptable polymer composites with high&#8208;performance reliability over wide temperature range are imperative for various applications. However, the distinct filler&#8208;matrix thermomechanical behaviors often cause severe structure damage and performance degradation upon large thermal shock. To address this issue, a general strategy is proposed to construct leakage&#8208;free, self&#8208;adaptive, stable percolation networks in polymer composites over wide temperature (77&#8211;473 K) with biphasic Ga35In65 alloy. The in situ micro&#8208;CT technology, for the first time, reveals the conformable phase transitions of Ga35In65 alloys in the polymer matrix that help repair the disruptive conductive networks over large temperature variations. The cryo&#8208;expanded Ga compensates the disruptive carbon networks at low temperatures, and flowable Ga and melted In at high temperatures conformably fill and repair the deboned interfaces and yielded crevices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this temperature&#8208;resistant composite demonstrates superb electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding properties and stability even after a large temperature shock (&#916;T = 396 K). Furthermore, the superiority of the construction of temperature self&#8208;adaptive networks within the composite enables them for additive manufacturing of application&#8208;oriented components. This work offers helpful inspiration for developing high&#8208;performance polymer composites for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Protein&#8208;Escaping Dyes Enable High&#8208;Contrast and Long&#8208;Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much&#8208;enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low&#8208;quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long&#8208;term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR&#8208;I/II&#160;Cl&#8208;containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein&#8208;escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein&#8208;escaping probes that achieve dual&#8208;excitation (808 and 1064&#160;nm) interference&#8208;free imaging of nerve&#8208;vessel and tumor&#8208;vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein&#8208;escaping dyes enable long&#8208;term repeatable dual&#8208;color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor&#8208;vessel reconstruction at the wound site.

&lt;p&gt;Protein-escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much-enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short-term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Broken Inversion Symmetry in Van Der Waals Topological Ferromagnetic Metal Iron Germanium Telluride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Definitive evidence for inversion symmetry breaking in iron germanium telluride (FGT) is reported using second harmonic generation (SHG). Fe&#160;deficiency and temperature&#160;dependent SHG evolution conclude that Fe vacancies break the inversion symmetry and reduce the centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1. These findings add crucial new information to understanding FGT: band topology, intrinsic spin&#160;orbit torque, skyrmion, and topological polar metal states.








Abstract
Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin&#8208;orbit torque, which is crucial for next&#8208;generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque is established in the topological van der Waals&#160;(vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique is reported. The data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the threefold SHG pattern with dominant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp threefold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to the understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque, and topological vdW polar metal states.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Ultrathin Alloy Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)/fcc heterophase is well achieved. Notably, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate superior catalytic performance toward nitrate electroreduction to ammonia than hcp/fcc RuMo NFs. Mechanism studies reveal that crystal phase engineering of RuMo alloy nanostructures can significantly improve the electroactivity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) toward ammonia synthesis is recognized as a sustainable strategy to balance the global nitrogen cycle. However, it still remains a great challenge to achieve highly efficient ammonia production due to the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process in NO3RR. Here, the controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed/fcc heterophase for highly efficient NO3RR is reported. Significantly, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate high Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% and a large yield rate of 32.7&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 toward ammonia production at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have unraveled that fcc RuMo NFs possess the highest d&#8208;band center with superior electroactivity, which originates from the strong Ru&#9472;Mo interactions and the high intrinsic activity of the unconventional fcc phase. The optimal electronic structures of fcc RuMo NFs supply strong adsorption of key intermediates with suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution, which further determines the remarkable NO3RR performance. The successful demonstration of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries with fcc RuMo NFs suggests their substantial application potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.

Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2309183, Ji&#8208;Won Jung, Sang&#8208;Jin Lee, Hyun&#8208;Suk Kim, and co&#8208;workers focus on developing miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs), specifically addressing the challenge of low energy density in these batteries. The study introduces an innovative design for SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, closely resembling traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, which include an active material, a conductive agent, and a binder. A key innovation of this research is the use of mid&#8208;frequency (MF) sputtering to create a singular hybrid thin&#8208;film composed of SiOx nanoparticles, several conductive agents, and a strong binder made of plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). Our design, which is analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes, proposes a new approach to TF&#8208;LIB fabrication.

Optical Encryption
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independent and reliably manipulated in a rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display based on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly. The display has the benefit of being a direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. More details can be found in article number 2310130 by Cheolmin Park and co&#8208;workers.

Lithium Metal Batteries
Lithium metal anodes exhibit over 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density based on conversion chemistry and are being prioritized as the next generation of energy storage devices. In article number 2311687 by Shaohua Guo and co&#8208;workers, various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are summarized, and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) are provided. This review offers a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2
In article number 2311537 by Jincun Zhao, Xun Sun, and co&#8208;workers, a specific ACE2&#8208;binding peptide with a superior antiviral activity was identified and used to modified the inhaled nanoemulsions. The inhaled remdesivir nanoemulsions strongly inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 not only by blocking the binding of virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restricting virus replication intracellularly.

Information&#8208;Processing Materials
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The biomolecular decoder is programmed to convert specific binary molecular inputs into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and sensor signal processing. More details can be found in article number 2308092 by Wilfried Weber and co&#8208;workers.

Electrically Confined Electroluminescence
In article number 2310498, Gwan&#8208;Hyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers demonstrate electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By achieving balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, and confining neutral exciton within the 1D region, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2% at room temperature, which will be a promising approach to enhancing the EQE and modulating exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.

By achieving balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, and confining neutral exciton within the 1D region, the WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2% at room temperature, which will be a promising approach to enhancing the EQE and modulating exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.

Orbital Gauge Field
In article number 2310010, Xian&#8208;Min Jin and co&#8208;workers realize an orbital gauge field to transmit high&#8208;dimensional quantum states. The orbital gauge field is constructed by a rotational defect on an atom&#8208;like lattice and shows a generalized and appealing perspective to control the behaviors of particles. The Hall&#8208;like transport of high&#8208;dimensional quantum states with protected orbital angular momentum represents a step towards generalized and large&#8208;scale quantum engineering.

         <title>Features of Anisotropic Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to micron sized particles or capsules, including non&#8208;spherical shape, loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems for fabrication are under discussion.








Abstract
Natural materials are anisotropic. Delivery systems occurring in nature, such as viruses, blood cells, pollen, and many others, do have anisotropy, while delivery systems made artificially are mostly isotropic. There is apparent complexity in engineering anisotropic particles or capsules with micron and submicron sizes. Nevertheless, some promising examples of how to fabricate particles with anisotropic shapes or having anisotropic chemical and/or physical properties are developed. Anisotropy of particles, once they face biological systems, influences their behavior. Internalization by the cells, flow in the bloodstream, biodistribution over organs and tissues, directed release, and toxicity of particles regardless of the same chemistry are all reported to be factors of anisotropy of delivery systems. Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to particles or capsules, including loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties primarily by anisotropic magnetic properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems and limitations for fabrication are under discussion.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance Conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights the contribution of multifunctional nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and influence of their microscale biomaterial architecture on the nerve repairment. Chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, anisotropic assembly microstructure, electroactivity and magnetic&#8208;sensitivity are expected to be pioneering features in the effective NGCs. The biosafety assessment and clinical trials of multifunctional NGCs are urgently required before the commercial application.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with advanced architectures are also proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogenous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs are also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies, and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as novel material paradigms with intrinsic ferroic behaviors. This review summarizes the fundamentals and design strategies of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and ferromagnetism in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites, and also discusses the underlying mechanisms of their multiferroic and magnetoelectric properties. The potential implementation in multilevel ferroic modulation, chirality as well as spin orbitronics is also presented.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the coexistence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multilevel ferroic modulation,&#160;chiral spin textures,&#160;and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building upon the established chelate and macrocyclic effects, supramolecular chemists have exploited the mechanical bond to create selective supramolecular hosts with enhanced binding affinities and selectivity over non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocyclic host analogs. This review delineates advantages of mechanically interlocked hosts for charged species, and discusses current and potential applications of the mechanical bond effect for recognition and sensing applications.








Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection, and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

         <title>Memristor&#8208;Based Neuromorphic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Additionally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.








Abstract
In the era of information, characterized by an exponential growth in data volume and an escalating level of data abstraction, there has been a substantial focus on brain&#8208;like chips, which are known for their robust processing power and energy&#8208;efficient operation. Memristors are widely acknowledged as the optimal electronic devices for the realization of neuromorphic computing, due to their innate ability to emulate the interconnection and information transfer processes witnessed among neurons. This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Subsequently, a thorough discussion of the memristor array, which serves as the pivotal component of the neuromorphic chip, as well as an examination of the present mainstream neural networks, is delved. Furthermore, the design of the neuromorphic chip is categorized into three crucial sections, including synapse&#8208;neuron cores, networks on chip (NoC), and neural network design. Finally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.

         <title>From Liquid to Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides as Emerging Cathodes with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospects for commercialization of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs with high energy density are highly encouraging, which will develop new opportunities to overcome the energy density and safety limitations of conventional liquid batteries. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary efforts are expected to overcome omni&#8208;direction challenges and propel LRMO cathodes toward practical applications in ASSBs significantly.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRMO) cathode materials have attracted widespread attention due to their high specific capacity, energy density, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as poor cycling stability, voltage deca,y and oxygen escape limit their commercial application in liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of safe and resilient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), driven by their remarkable safety features and superior energy density. ASSBs based on LRMO cathodes offer distinct advantages over conventional liquid Li&#8208;ion batteries, including long&#8208;term cycle stability, thermal and wider electrochemical windows stability, as well as the prevention of transition metal dissolution. This review aims to recapitulate the challenges and fundamental understanding associated with the application of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs. Additionally, it proposes the mechanisms of interfacial mechanical and chemical instability, introduces noteworthy strategies to enhance oxygen redox reversibility, enhances high&#8208;voltage interfacial stability, and optimizes Li+ transfer kinetics. Furthermore, it suggests potential research approaches to facilitate the large&#8208;scale implementation of LRMO cathodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Undercoordination Chemistry of Sulfur Electrocatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research advances of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis including operation strategy and underlying working mechanisms are systematically combed in this review. Underlying working mechanisms are detailedly summarized in terms of polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives regarding the future of undercoordination chemistry are proposed.








Abstract
Undercoordination chemistry is an effective strategy to modulate the geometry&#8208;governed electronic structure and thereby regulate the activity of sulfur electrocatalysts. Efficient sulfur electrocatalysis is requisite to overcome the sluggish kinetics in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries aroused by multi&#8208;electron transfer and multi&#8208;phase conversions. Recent advances unveil the great promise of undercoordination chemistry in facilitating and stabilizing sulfur electrochemistry, yet a related review with systematicness and perspectives is still missing. Herein, it is carefully combed through the recent progress of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis. The typical material structures and operational strategies are elaborated, while the underlying working mechanism is also detailly introduced and generalized into polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives on the future development of undercoordination chemistry are further proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in copper&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable production of valuable fuels and chemicals via electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions are summarized. The rational design of metallic copper, compounds, alloys, composites, and single&#8208;atom catalysts results in efficient electroreduction of substrates to valorized alkenes, alcohols, ammonia, amines, urea, and so on. The current issues and future opportunities in this area are provided.








Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among the various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products is focused. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, and C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Personalized Cancer Nanomedicine: Overcoming Biological Barriers for Intracellular Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discovers how RNA and 
mAbs&#160;are shaping the future of personalized cancer nanomedicine. This also dives into the current landscape and nanotechnology's battle with protein corona phenomena, explores strategies for enhanced tumor access and penetration, and confronts the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must conquer to reach intracellular domains. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and potential prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. This review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.

         <title>Molecular Engineering toward Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and proposes a variety of design principles. Various organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively and systematically summarized to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs for lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density are becoming increasingly important in global sustainability initiatives. However, uncontrollable dendrite seeds, inscrutable interfacial chemistry, and repetitively formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have severely hindered the advancement of LMBs. Organic molecules have been ingeniously engineered to construct targeted SEI and effectively minimize the above issues. In this review, multiple organic molecules, including polymer, fluorinated molecules, and organosulfur, are comprehensively summarized and insights into how to construct the corresponding elastic, fluorine&#8208;rich, and organosulfur&#8208;containing SEIs are provided. A variety of meticulously selected cases are analyzed in depth to support the arguments of molecular design in SEI. Specifically, the evolution of organic molecules&#8208;derived SEI is discussed and corresponding design principles are proposed, which are beneficial in guiding researchers to understand and architect SEI based on organic molecules. This review provides a design guideline for constructing organic molecule&#8208;derived SEI and will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the exploitation of LMBs.

         <title>Bypassing the Single Junction Limit with Advanced Photovoltaic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 14, April 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian optimization&#8208;based simulation framework is presented, able to perform virtual optimization of multi&#8208;junction solar cell architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Vertical and lateral architectures are proposed to surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion.








Abstract
Multijunction devices and photon up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion are prominent concepts aimed at increasing photovoltaic efficiencies beyond the single junction limit. Integrating these concepts into advanced architectures may address long&#8208;standing issues such as processing complexity, microstructure control, and resilience against spectral changes of the incoming radiation. However, so far, no models have been established to predict the performance of such integrated architectures. Here, a simulation environment based on Bayesian optimization is presented, that can predict and virtually optimize the electrical performance of multi&#8208;junction architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi&#8208;junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.

         <title>Suppressing Ion Migration by Synergistic Engineering of Anion and Cation toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synergistic effect of dimethylammonium and trifluoroacetate, the perovskite solar cells and modules with DMATFA deliver a promising power conversion efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively. The modified device demonstrates excellent operational stability by maintaining 91% of its initial efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.









Abstract
Ion migration&#8208;induced intrinsic instability and large&#8208;area fabrication pose a tough challenge for the commercial deployment of perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, an interface heterojunction and metal electrode stabilization strategy is developed by suppressing ion migration via managing lead&#8208;based imperfections. After screening a series of cations and nonhalide anions, the ideal organic salt molecule dimethylammonium trifluoroacetate (DMATFA) consisting of dimethylammonium (DMA+) cation and trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) anion is selected to manipulate the surface of perovskite films. DMA+ enables the conversion of active excess and/or unreacted PbI2 into stable new phase DMAPbI3, inhibiting photodecomposition of PbI2 and ion migration. Meanwhile, TFA&#8722; can suppress iodide ion migration through passivating undercoordinated Pb2+ and/or iodide vacancies. DMA+ and TFA&#8722; synergistically stabilize the heterojunction interface and silver electrode. The DMATFA&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells and modules achieve a maximum efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively, which is the record efficiency ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation technology. The DMATFA modification results in outstanding operational stability, as evidenced by maintaining 91% of its original efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.

         <title>High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Synergistic Side&#8208;Chain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z19, designed by synergistic side&#8208;chain engineering, affords binary organic solar cells (OSCs) with an impressive PCE of 19.2% at a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), 1.002&#160;V. This is the best performance ever reported for OSCs, VOC&#160;&gt;&#160;1.0&#160;V. Indications are that such design of organic semiconductors, considering the energy&#8208;gap law, may offer the next efficiency breakthrough in OSCs.








Abstract
Restricted by the energy&#8208;gap law, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit relatively low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) because of large nonradiative energy losses (&#916;Enonrad). Moreover, the trade&#8208;off between VOC and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OSCs is more distinctive; the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs are still &lt;15% with VOCs of &gt;1.0&#160;V. Herein, the electronic properties and aggregation behaviors of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are carefully considered and then a new NFA (Z19) is delicately designed by simultaneously introducing alkoxy and phenyl&#8208;substituted alkyl chains to the conjugated backbone. Z19 exhibits a hypochromatic&#8208;shifted absorption spectrum, high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level and ordered 2D packing mode. The D18:Z19&#8208;based blend film exhibits favorable phase separation with face&#8208;on dominated molecular orientation, facilitating charge transport properties. Consequently, D18:Z19 binary devices afford an exciting PCE of 19.2% with a high VOC of 1.002&#160;V, surpassing Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based devices. The former is the highest PCE reported to date for OSCs with VOCs of &gt;1.0&#160;V. Moreover, the&#160;&#916;Enonrad of Z19&#8208; (0.200&#160;eV) and Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based (0.155&#160;eV) devices are lower than that of Y6&#8208;based (0.239&#160;eV) devices. Indications are that the design of such NFA, considering the energy&#8208;gap law, could promote a new breakthrough in OSCs.

         <title>In Situ Nanofiber Formation Blocks AXL and GAS6 Binding to Suppress Ovarian Cancer Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of in situ nanofiber formation is proposed to inhibit Anexelekto (AXL) signaling to efficiently suppress ovarian cancer development. After administration, Nap&#8208;IR specifically targets AXL on cancer cell membrane, followed by receptor&#8208;instructed nanoparticle&#8208;to&#8208;nanofiber transition. The formed nanofibers block AXL and growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6) binding to inhibit AXL and disrupt its downstream pathway events, leading to enhanced apoptosis of ovarian tumors.








Abstract
Anexelekto (AXL) is an attractive molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy because of its important role in ovarian cancer initiation and progression. To date, several AXL inhibitors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, the disadvantages of low AXL affinity and severe off&#8208;target toxicity of these inhibitors limit their further clinical applications. Herein, by rational design of a nonapeptide derivative Nap&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Glu&#8208;Ile&#8208;Arg&#8208;Leu&#8208;Arg&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys (Nap&#8208;IR), a strategy of in situ nanofiber formation is proposed to suppress ovarian cancer growth. After administration, Nap&#8208;IR specifically targets overexpressed AXL on ovarian cancer cell membranes and undergoes a receptor&#8208;instructed nanoparticle&#8208;to&#8208;nanofiber transition. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that in situ formed Nap&#8208;IR nanofibers efficiently induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by blocking AXL activation and disrupting subsequent downstream signaling events. Remarkably, Nap&#8208;IR can synergistically enhance the anticancer effect of cisplatin against HO8910 ovarian tumors. It is anticipated that the Nap&#8208;IR can be applied in clinical ovarian cancer therapy in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Color&#8208;Rendition White QLEDs by Balancing Red, Green and Blue Centres in Eco&#8208;Friendly ZnCuGaS:In@ZnS Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An In3+&#8208;doped strategy in ZnCuGaS@ZnS QDs to balance the carrier distribution among multi&#8208;centers is proposed. The In3+&#8208;doped tactics reduces the proportional variation among each luminescent center over time, and provides the possibility of realizing stable mono&#8208;component electro&#8208;white&#8208;luminescence.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are the key components in the next&#8208;generation lighting and display devices. The inherent toxicity of Cd/Pb&#8208;based quantum dots (QDs) limits the further application in WLEDs. Recently, more attention is focused on eco&#8208;friendly QDs and their WLEDs, especially the phosphor&#8208;free WLEDs based on mono&#8208;component, which profits from bias&#8208;insensitive color stability. However, the imbalanced carrier distribution between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue luminescent centers, even the absence of a certain luminescent center, hinders their balanced and stable photoluminescence/electroluminescence (PL/EL). Here, an In3+&#8208;doped strategy in Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ga&#8208;S@ZnS QDs is first proposed, and the balanced carrier distribution is realized by non&#8208;equivalent substitution and In3+ doping concentration modulation. The alleviation of the green emitter by the In3+&#8208;related red emitter and the compensation of blue emitter by the Zn&#8208;related electronic states contribute to the balanced red&#8208;green&#8208;blue emitting with high PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 95.3% and long lifetime (T90) of over 1100 h in atmospheric conditions. Thus, the In3+&#8208;doped WLEDs can achieve exceedingly slight proportional variations between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue EL intensity over time (&#8710;CIE = (0.007, 0.009)), and high champion CRI of 94.9. This study proposes a single&#8208;component QD with balanced and stable red&#8208;green&#8208;blue PL/EL spectrum, meeting the requirements of lighting and display.

         <title>50&#8208;nm Gas&#8208;Filled Protein Nanostructures to Enable the Access of Lymphatic Cells by Ultrasound Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large size of microbubbles and nanobubbles greatly limits the cell populations that ultrasound imaging and delivery can access. This article introduces genetically engineered virus&#8208;size gaseous nanostructures, representing the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge. They have demonstrated the ability to penetrate deep tissues in lymph nodes.








Abstract
Ultrasound imaging and ultrasound&#8208;mediated gene and drug delivery are rapidly advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods; however, their use is often limited by the need for microbubbles, which cannot transverse many biological barriers due to their large size. Here, the authors introduce 50&#8208;nm gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures derived from genetically engineered gas vesicles(GVs)&#160;that are referred to as 50 nmGVs. These diamond&#8208;shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles and are, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles made to date. 50 nmGVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected 50 nmGVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen&#8208;presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. The authors anticipate that 50 nmGVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas&#8208;filled nanomaterials.

         <title>Biphase Pd Nanosheets with Atomic&#8208;Hybrid RhOx/Pd Amorphous Skins Disentangle the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphase Pd@PdRh nanosheets within the form of ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd{111} inner cores wrapped by &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins are innovatively designed and synthesized. The surface flexible atomic&#8208;coordination and enriched RhOx/Pd atomic&#8208;interfaces cooperatively endow the products with unprecedented electrocatalysis performance for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade&#8208;off dilemma for alkaline ORR are developed. The superthin amorphous skins significantly amplify the quantity of flexibly low&#8208;coordinated atoms for electrocatalysis. An in situ selected oxidation of the top&#8208;surface Rh dopants creates atomically hybrid RhOx/Pd disorder surfaces. Detailed energy spectra and theoretical simulation confirm that these RhOx/Pd interfaces can arouse a surface charge redistribution, causing significant electron deficiency and lowered d&#8208;band center for surface Pd. Meanwhile, anticorrosive Rh/RhOx species can thermodynamically passivate the neighboring Pd atoms from oxidative dissolution. Thanks to these amplified interfacial effects, the biphase c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs simultaneously exhibit a superhigh ORR activity (5.92 A mg&#8722;1, 22.8 times that of Pt/C) and an outstanding long&#8208;lasting stability after 100k cycles of accelerated durability test, showcasing unprecedented electrocatalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of ORR. This work paves a bran&#8208;new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts through creating modulated amorphous skins on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

         <title>3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers with Locally Varying Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ink composed of jammed precursor&#8208;loaded elastomeric microparticles that can be direct ink written into double network granular elastomers that can attain a wide range of stiffnesses and ultimate tensile strains is presented. Inks with different stiffnesses can be 3D printed into cm&#8208;sized structures with locally varying compositions and hence mechanical properties using commercial multinozzle 3D printers.








Abstract
Fast advances in the design of soft actuators and robots demand for new soft materials whose mechanical properties can be changed over short length scales.

&lt;p&gt;A novel ink composed of jammed precursor-loaded elastomeric microparticles that can be direct ink written into double network granular elastomers that can attain a wide range of stiffnesses and ultimate tensile strains is presented. Inks with different stiffnesses can be 3D printed into cm-sized structures with locally varying compositions and hence mechanical properties using commercial multinozzle 3D printers.

         <title>Toward the High&#8208;Voltage Stability of Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Challenges, Progress, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered oxide cathodes (LOCs) encounter significant challenges when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions (&gt; 4.0&#160;V versus Na+/Na) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this review, the prominent challenges and the recent efforts made to improve the high&#8208;voltage stability of LOCs are highlighted. Moreover, the future directions and prospects of LOCs are outlined for enabling high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention as ideal candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their notable advantages in terms of resource availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, there remains a substantial energy density gap between SIBs and commercially available lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), posing challenges to meeting the requirements of practical applications. The fabrication of high&#8208;energy cathodes has emerged as an efficient approach to enhancing the energy density of SIBs, which commonly requires cathodes operating in high&#8208;voltage regions. Layered oxide cathodes (LOCs), with low cost, facile synthesis, and high theoretical specific capacity, have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications. However, LOCs encounter significant challenges when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions such as irreversible phase transitions, migration and dissolution of metal cations, loss of reactive oxygen, and the occurrence of serious interfacial parasitic reactions. These issues ultimately result in severe degradation in battery performance. This review aims to shed light on the key challenges and failure mechanisms encountered by LOCs when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions. Additionally, the corresponding strategies for improving the high&#8208;voltage stability of LOCs are comprehensively summarized. By providing fundamental insights and valuable perspectives, this review aims to contribute to the advancement of high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Stable and Highly Active Single Atom Configurations for Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward approach to stabilize (and activate) platinum single atoms (Pt SAs) on TiO2 surfaces is shown. Through the optimization of post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments, few&#8208;atom Pt assemblies that are resistant to agglomeration are successfully formed and exhibited significantly enhanced hydrogen production efficiency.








Abstract
The employment of single atoms (SAs), especially Pt SAs, as co&#8208;catalysts in photocatalytic H2 generation has gained significant attention due to their exceptional efficiency. However, a major challenge in their application is the light&#8208;induced agglomeration of these SAs into less active nanosized particles under photocatalytic conditions. This study addresses the stability and reactivity of Pt SAs on TiO2 surfaces by investigating various post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments in air, Ar, and Ar&#8208;H2 environments at different temperatures. It is described that annealing in an Ar&#8208;H2 atmosphere optimally stabilizes SA configurations, forming stable 2D rafts of assembled SAs &#8776;0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm in diameter. These rafts not only resist light&#8208;induced agglomeration but also exhibit significantly enhanced H2 production efficiency. The findings reveal a promising approach to maintaining the high reactivity of Pt SAs while overcoming the critical challenge of their stability under photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>Programmable DNA Interphase Layers for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high energy and power densities, as well as long cycle number have been achieved by an ultrathin and programmable DNA interphase layer. It represents an efficient yet long&#8208;neglected candidate for anode&#8208;free batteries, which not only breaks through the limitations in thickness and performance, but also provides a new paradigm to unlock next&#8208;generation energy storage.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising candidates for advanced energy storage, attributed to their appealing characteristics such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, their major challenges lie in the poor cycling and rate performance owing to the inferior reversibility and kinetics of Li plating and stripping, which significantly hinder their real&#8208;world applications. Here, it is demonstrated that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the most important genetic material in nature, can serve as a highly programmable interphase layer for innovation of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries. It is found that the abundant base pairs in DNA can contribute transient Li&#8211;N bonds that facilitate homogeneous Li+ flux, thus resulting in excellent Li plating/stripping kinetics and reversibility even at a harsh areal current of 15 mA cm&#8722;2. The anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries based on an ultrathin (0.12 &#181;m) and ultralight (&#8776;0.01 mg cm&#8722;2) DNA interphase layer show high CEs (&#8776;99.1%) over 400 cycles, corresponding to an increase of &#8776;186% compared with bare copper (Cu) foil. These results shed light on the excellent programmability of DNA as a new family of interphase materials for anode&#8208;free batteries, and provide a new paradigm for future battery innovation toward high programmability, high sustainability, and remarkable electrochemical performance.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Polyelectrolyte Complex Assembly of microRNA&#8208;Peptide Nanoparticles toward Treating Mesothelioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide design married with flash nanocomplexation affords highly stable and uniform polyelectrolyte complex microRNA&#8208;peptide nanoparticles (NPs). NP incorporation into a self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based surface&#8208;fill hydrogel allows local delivery to tumor and subsequent inhibition of genes responsible for the progression of mesothelioma cancer in mice.








Abstract
Broad size distributions and poor long&#8208;term colloidal stability of microRNA&#8208;carrying nanoparticles, especially those formed by polyelectrolyte complexation, represent major hurdles in realizing their clinical translation. Herein, peptide design is used alongside optimized flash nanocomplexation (FNC) to produce uniform peptide&#8208;based miRNA particles of exceptional stability that display anticancer activity against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo. Modulating the content and display of lysine&#8208;based charge from small intrinsically disordered peptides used to complex miRNA proves essential in achieving stable colloids. FNC facilitates kinetic isolation of the mechanistic steps involved in particle formation to allow the preparation of particles of discrete size in a highly reproducible, scalable, and continuous manner, facilitating pre&#8208;clinical studies. To the best of the authors knowledge, this work represents the first example of employing FNC to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes of miRNA and peptide. Encapsulation of these particles into an injectable hydrogel matrix allows for their localized in vivo delivery by syringe. A one&#8208;time injection of a gel containing particles composed of miRNA&#8208;215&#8208;5p and the peptide PKM1 limits tumor progression in a xenograft model of mesothelioma.

         <title>Releasing Free Radicals in Precursor Triggers the Formation of Closed Pores in Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sufficient free radicals formed by part delignification are helpful to direct the formation of closed pores, while excessive free radicals formed by nearly total delignificaion compete for limited precursor debris to form smaller microcrystals and therefore reduce the amounts of closed pores.








Abstract
Increasing closed pore volume in hard carbon is considered to be the most effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of systematic insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level. In this study, a regulation strategy of closed pores via adjustment of the content of free radicals is reported. Sufficient free radicals are exposed by part delignification of bamboo, which is related to the formation of well&#8208;developed carbon layers and rich closed pores.

The optimal sample delivers a large closed pore volume of 0.203 cm3 g&#8722;1, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 350 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 mA g&#8722;1 and enhanced Na+ transfer kinetics. This work provides insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level, enabling rational design of hard carbon pore structures.

&lt;p&gt;Sufficient free radicals formed by part delignification are helpful to direct the formation of closed pores, while excessive free radicals formed by nearly total delignificaion compete for limited precursor debris to form smaller microcrystals and therefore reduce the amounts of closed pores.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing closed pore volume in hard carbon is considered to be the most effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance in sodium-ion batteries. However, there is a lack of systematic insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level. In this study, a regulation strategy of closed pores via adjustment of the content of free radicals is reported. Sufficient free radicals are exposed by part delignification of bamboo, which is related to the formation of well-developed carbon layers and rich closed pores. In addition, excessive free radicals from nearly total delignification lead to more reactive sites during pyrolysis, which competes for limited precursor debris to form smaller microcrystals and therefore compact the material. The optimal sample delivers a large closed pore volume of 0.203 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 350 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer kinetics. This work provides insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level, enabling rational design of hard carbon pore structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicolor Photochemical Printing Inside Polymer Matrices for Advanced Photonic Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional security inks printed on the data page surface are vulnerable to counterfeiters and can be chemically deciphered. To address this issue, high&#8208;quality multicolored fluorescent patterns inside the polymer matrices for the first time are photochemically printed. Moreover, these patterns are chemically indecipherable, offering a superior way to fight against document fraud.








Abstract
Conventional security inks, generally directly printed on the data page surface, are vulnerable to counterfeiters, thereby raising the risk of chemical structural deciphering. In fact, polymer film&#8208;based data pages with customized patterns embedded within polymer matrix, rather than printed on the surface, emerge as a promising solution. Therefore, the key lies in developing fluorophores offering light dose&#8208;controlled fluorescent color inside polymer matrices. Though conventional fluorophores often suffer from photobleaching and uncontrolled photoreactions, disqualifying them for this purpose. Herein a diphenanthridinylfumaronitrile&#8208;based phototransformers (trans&#8208;D5) that undergoes photoisomerization and subsequent photocyclization during photopolymerization of the precursor, successively producing cis&#8208; and cyclo&#8208;D5 with stepwise redshifted solid&#8208;state emissions is developed. The resulting cyclo&#8208;D5 exhibits up to 172 nm emission redshift in rigidifying polymer matrices, while trans&#8208;D5 experiences a slightly blueshifted emission (&#8776;28 nm), cis&#8208;D5 undergoes a modest redshift (&#8776;14 nm). The markedly different rigidochromic behaviors of three D5 molecules within polymer matrices enable multicolor photochemical printing with a broad hue ranging from 38 to 10 via an anticlockwise direction in Munsell color space, yielding indecipherable fluorescent patterns in polymer films. This work provides a new method for document protection and implements advanced security features that are unattainable with conventional inks.

         <title>Ordered Vacancies as Sodium Ion Micropumps in Cu&#8208;Deficient Copper Indium Diselenide to Enhance Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies are synthesized by a facile ion extraction strategy. The Cu0.54In1.15Se2 exhibits excellent cycling and rate performance as an anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its distinct ordered vacancy structure, which cannot only serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps to achieve a homogeneous distribution of Na+ but also boost the sodium ion diffusion.








Abstract
Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;C and a high&#8208;rate stability of 311.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal&#8208;ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.

         <title>Regulating Surface&#8208;Passivator Binding Priority for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative losses through passivators is a prerequisite for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, the complex bonding between passivators and perovskites severely suppresses the passivation process, which still lacks comprehensive understanding. Herein, the number, category, and degree of bonds between different functional groups and the perovskite are quantitatively assessed to study the passivation dynamics. Functional groups with high electrostatic potential and large steric hindrance prioritize strong bonding with organic cations and halides on the perfect surface, leading to suppressed coordination with bulky defects. By modulating the binding priorities and coordination capacity, hindrance from the intense interaction with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced, leading to a more direct passivation process. Consequently, the near&#8208;infrared PeLED without external light out&#8208;coupling demonstrates a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% at a current density of 42&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, the device exhibits a record&#8208;level&#8208;cycle ON/OFF switching of 20000 and ultralong half&#8208;lifetime of 1126.3&#160;h under 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A deep understanding of the passivators would offer new insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Projection Stereolithography 3D Printing High&#8208;Conductive Hydrogel for Flexible Passive Wireless Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electronics have inherent similarities to biological tissues and hold potential for wearable applications. However, low conductivity, poor stretchability, non&#8208;personalizability, and uncontrollable dehydration during use limit their further development. In this study, we report projection stereolithography 3D printing high&#8208;conductive hydrogel for flexible passive wireless sensing. The prepared photocurable silver&#8208;based hydrogel is rapidly planarized into antenna shapes on substrates using surface projection stereolithography. After partial dehydration, silver flakes within the circuits form sufficient conductive pathways to achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1). By sealing the circuits to prevent further dehydration, the resistance remains stable when tensile strain is less than 100% for at least 30 days. Besides, the sealing materials provide versatile functionalities, such as stretchability and shape memory property. Customized flexible RFID tags are fabricated by integrating with commercial chips to complete the accurate recognition of eye movement, realizing passive wireless sensing.

         <title>Contactless User&#8208;interactive Sensing Display for Human&#8211;human and Human&#8211;machine Interactions</title>

Abstract
Creating a large&#8208;scale contactless user&#8208;interactive sensing display (CUISD) with optimal features is challenging but crucial for efficient human&#8208;human or human&#8208;machine interactions. This study reports a CUISD based on dynamic alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) that responds to humidity. Subsecond humidity&#8208;induced luminescence is achieved by integrating a highly responsive hydrogel into the ACEL layer. The patterned silver nanofiber electrode and luminescence layer, produced through electrospinning and microfabrication, result in a stretchable, large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution, multicolor, and dynamic CUISD. The CUISD is implemented for the real&#8208;time control of a remote&#8208;controlled car, wherein the luminescence signals induced by touchless finger movements are distinguished and encoded to deliver specific commands. Moreover, the distinctive recognition of breathing facilitates the CUISD to serve as a visual signal transmitter for information interaction, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a large-scale contactless user-interactive sensing display (CUISD) with optimal features is challenging but crucial for efficient human-human or human-machine interactions. This study reports a CUISD based on dynamic alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) that responds to humidity. Subsecond humidity-induced luminescence is achieved by integrating a highly responsive hydrogel into the ACEL layer. The patterned silver nanofiber electrode and luminescence layer, produced through electrospinning and microfabrication, result in a stretchable, large-scale, high-resolution, multicolor, and dynamic CUISD. The CUISD is implemented for the real-time control of a remote-controlled car, wherein the luminescence signals induced by touchless finger movements are distinguished and encoded to deliver specific commands. Moreover, the distinctive recognition of breathing facilitates the CUISD to serve as a visual signal transmitter for information interaction, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities. The paradigm shift depicted in this work is expected to reshape the way we interact with each other and devices, discovering niche applications in virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Glycolysis&#8208;dominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells can promote their therapeutic resistance against radiotherapy (RT). Carbon monoxide (CO) as a glycolysis inhibitor can enhance the efficiency of RT. Herein, we developed an X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanocomposite (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8208;guest interactions between the radiosensitizer and CO donor for enhanced RT. The encapsulated gold nanoclusters (CD&#8208;AuNCs) could effectively generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray radiation, which not only directly inactivate cancer cells but also induce in situ CO gas generation from adamantane modified metal carbonyl (Ada&#8208;CO) for glycolysis inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that HA@AuNC@CO exhibited active targeting towards CD44 overexpressed cancer cells, along with excellent inhibition of glycolysis and efficient RT against cancer. This study offers a new strategy for the combination of gas therapy and RT in tumor treatment.

         <title>Eliminating the Burn&#8208;in Loss of Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells by Applying Dimer Acceptors as Supramolecular Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The meta&#8208;stable active layer morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been identified as the main cause of the rapid burn&#8208;in loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) during long&#8208;term device operation. However, effective strategies to eliminate the associated loss mechanisms from the initial stage of device operation are still lacking, especially for high&#8208;efficiency material systems. Herein, we report the introduction of molecularly engineered dimer acceptors with adjustable thermal transition properties into the active layer of OSCs to serve as supramolecular stabilizers for regulating the thermal transitions and optimizing the crystallization of the absorber composites. By establishing intimate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with small&#8208;molecule acceptors, these stabilizers can effectively reduce the trap&#8208;state density (Nt) in the devices to achieve excellent PCEs over 19%. More importantly, the low Nt associated with an initially optimized morphology can be maintained under external stresses to significantly reduce the PCE burn&#8208;in loss in devices. Our research reveals a judicious approach to improving OPV stability by establishing a comprehensive correlation between material properties, active&#8208;layer morphology, and device performance, for developing burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OSCs.

         <title>Large&#8208;area Flexible Carbon Nanofilms with Synergistically Enhanced Transmittance and Conductivity Prepared by Reorganizing Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;area flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs) are highly desired for future electronic devices. Nanocarbon TCFs (NC&#8208;TCFs) are one of the most promising candidates, but some of their properties are mutually restricted. Here, a novel carbon nanotube network reorganization (CNNR) strategy, i.e., facet&#8208;driven CNNR (FD&#8208;CNNR) technique, is presented to overcome this intractable contradiction. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique basically introduces an interaction between single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and Cu&#8208;O. Based on the unique FD&#8208;CNNR mechanism, large&#8208;area flexible reorganized carbon nanofilms (RNC&#8208;TCFs) are designed and fabricated with A3&#8208;size and even meter&#8208;length, including reorganized SWNT (RSWNT) films and graphene and reorganized SWNT (G&#8208;RSWNT) hybrid films. Synergistical improvement in strength, transmittance and conductivity of flexible RNC&#8208;TCFs has been achieved. The G&#8208;RSWNT TCF shows a sheet resistance as low as 69 &#937; sq&#8722;1 at 86% transmittance, FOM value of 35, and Young's modulus of &#8764;45 MPa. The high strength enables RNC&#8208;TCFs to be freestanding on water and easily transferred to any target substrate without contamination. An A4&#8208;size flexible smart window is fabricated, which manifests controllable dimming and fog removal. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique can be extended to large&#8208;area or even large&#8208;scale fabrication of TCFs, and can provide new insights into design of TCFs and other functional films.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Engineering of Cubic SiP with Metallic Conductivity for Fast and Durable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A cost&#8208;effective, scalable ball milling process is employed to synthesize the InGeSiP3 compound with a cubic ZnS structure, aiming to address the sluggish reaction kinetics of Si&#8208;based anodes for Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Experimental measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirm that the synthesized InGeSiP3 exhibits significantly higher electronic conductivity, larger Li&#8208;ion diffusivity, and greater tolerance to volume change than its parent phases InGe (or Si)P2 or In (or Ge, or Si)P. These improvements stem from its elevated configurational entropy. Multiple characterizations validate that InGeSiP3 undergoes a reversible Li&#8208;storage mechanism that involves intercalation, followed by conversion and alloy reactions, resulting in a reversible capacity of 1,733 mA h g&#8722;1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 90%. Moreover, the InGeSiP3&#8208;based electrodes exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining a 1,121 mA h g&#8722;1 capacity with a retention rate of &#8764;87% after 1,500 cycles at 2,000 mA g&#8722;1 and remarkable high&#8208;rate capability, achieving 882 mA h g&#8722;1 at 10,000 mA g&#8722;1. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of high entropy, we extend our synthesis to high entropy GaCu (or Zn)InGeSiP5, CuZnInGeSiP5, GaCuZnInGeSiP6, InGeSiP2S (or Se), and InGeSiPSSe. This endeavor overcomes the immiscibility of different metals and non&#8208;metals, paving the way for electrochemical energy storage application of high&#8208;entropy silicon&#8208;phosphides.

Abstract
Current synthetic grafts for ligament rupture repair often fail to integrate well with the surrounding biological tissue, leading to complications such as graft wear, fatigue, and subsequent re&#8208;rupture. To address this medical challenge, this study aims at advancing the development of a biological ligament through the integration of physiologically&#8208;inspired principles and tissue engineering strategies. In this study, we utilize interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation spinning technique, along with a custom&#8208;designed collection system, to fabricate a hierarchical scaffold mimicking native ligament structure. To emulate the bone&#8208;ligament interface and alleviate stress concentration, a hydroxyapatite mineral gradient is strategically introduced near both ends of the scaffold to enhance interface integration and diminish the risk of avulsion rupture. Biomimetic viscoelasticity is successfully displayed to provide similar mechanical support to native ligamentous tissue under physiological conditions. By introducing the connective tissue growth factor and conducting mesenchymal stem cells transplantation, we significantly amplify the regenerative potential of the synthetic ligament. This pioneering study offers a multifaceted solution combining biomimetic materials, regenerative therapies, and advanced techniques to potentially transform ligament rupture treatment.

         <title>An Electrode&#8208;Crosstalk&#8208;Suppressing Smart Polymer Electrolyte for High Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrode crosstalk between anode and cathode at elevated temperatures has been identified as a real culprit triggering the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, to address this challenge, a novel smart polymer electrolyte is prepared through in&#8208;situ polymerization of methyl methacrylate and acrylic anhydride monomers within a succinonitrile&#8208;based dual&#8208;anion deep eutectic solvent. Owing to the abundant active unsaturated double bonds on the as&#8208;obtained polymer matrix end, this smart polymer electrolyte can spontaneously form a dense crosslinked polymer network under elevated temperatures, effectively slowing down the crosstalk diffusion kinetics of lithium ions and active gases. Impressively, LiCoO2/graphite pouch cells employing this smart polymer electrolyte demonstrate no thermal runaway even at the temperature up to 250&#160;&#176;C via accelerating rate calorimeter testing. Meanwhile, because of its abundance of functional motifs, this smart polymer electrolyte can facilitate the formation of stable and thermally robust electrode/electrolyte interface on both electrodes, ensuring the long cycle life and high safety of LIBs. In specific, this smart polymer electrolyte endows 1.1 Ah LiCoO2/graphite pouch cell with a capacity retention of 96% after 398 cycles at 0.2 C.

Abstract
Crystallographic characteristics, including grain boundaries (GBs) and crystallographic orientation of each grain, are crucial in defining the properties of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs). To date, local microstructure analysis of 2DMs, which requires destructive and complex processes, has been primarily used to identify unknown 2DM specimens, hindering the subsequent use of characterized samples. Here, we present a nondestructive large&#8208;area 2D crystallographic analytical method through sticky&#8208;note&#8208;like van der Waals (vdW) assembling&#8208;disassembling. By the vdW assembling of veiled polycrystalline graphene (PCG) with a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystalline graphene filter (SCG&#8208;filter), we visualize detailed crystallographic information of each grain in PCGs through a 2D Raman signal scan, which relies on the interlayer twist angle. The scanned PCGs are seamlessly separated from the SCG&#8208;filter using vdW disassembling, preserving their original condition. The remaining SCG&#8208;filter then reuse for additional crystallographic scans of other PCGs. We believe our methods can pave the way for advances in the crystallographic analysis of single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick materials, offering huge implications for the applications of 2DMs.

         <title>Ordered Perovskite Structure with Functional Units for High Performance and Stable Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Ion migration is one of the most critical challenges that affects the stability of metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells. However, the current arsenal of available strategies for solving this issue is limited. Here, we construct novel perovskite active layers following the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) to intrinsically suppress ion migration, in which a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite layer is deposited by vapor deposition for light absorbing and a 2D layer is deposited by solution process for ion inhibition. As a promising result, the activation energy of ion migration increased from 0.36 eV for the conventional perovskite to 0.54 eV for the OSFU perovskite. These devices exhibit substantially enhanced operational stability in comparison with the conventional ones, retaining &gt;85% of their initial efficiencies after 1200&#8201;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1. Moreover, the OSFU devices show negligible fatigue behavior with a robust performance under light/dark cycling aging test (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol), which demonstrate the promising application of functional motif theory in this field.

         <title>A&#8208;D&#8208;A Molecule&#8211;Bridge Interface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface bridging strategy (IBS) is proposed to mitigate energy loss and enhance stability at the perovskite/C60 interface by designing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives. This IBS effectively passivates surface defects, enhances interfacial coupling, and optimizes the film&#8208;forming process of the C60 layer, leading to the successful development of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar submodules with an efficiency of 18.7%.








Abstract
As the photovoltaic field endeavors to transition perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to industrial applications, inverted PSCs, which incorporate fullerene as electron transport layers, have emerged as a compelling choice due to their augmented stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, these attributes suffer from performance issues stemming from suboptimal electrical characteristics at the perovskite/fullerene interface. To surmount these hurdles, an interface bridging strategy (IBS) is proposed to attenuate the interface energy loss and enhance the interfacial stability by designing a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A type perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives with multifaceted advantages. In addition to passivating defects, the IBS plays a crucial role in facilitating the binding between perovskite and fullerene, thereby enhancing interface coupling and importantly, improving the formation of fullerene films. The PMI derivatives, functioning as bridges, serve as a protective barrier to enhance the device stability. Consequently, the IBS enables a remarkable efficiency of 24.62% for lab&#8208;scale PSCs and an efficiency of 18.73% for perovskite solar modules craft on 156&#160;&#215;&#160;156&#160;mm2 substrates. The obtained efficiencies represent some of the highest recorded for fullerene&#8208;based devices, showcasing significant progress in designing interfacial molecules at the perovskite/fullerene interface and offering a promising path to enhance the commercial viability of PSCs.

         <title>Conversion of Layered WS2 Crystals into Mixed&#8208;Domain Electrochemical Catalysts by Plasma&#8208;Assisted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports an approach to maximize the electrocatalytic performance of mechanically exfoliated WS2 through sequential plasma treatments. This dry process can spatially tune the level of surface oxidation as well as the concentration of sulfur vacancies such that compositionally graded, mixed&#8208;domain electrochemical catalysts induced hydrogen evolution reaction performance greater than platinum with high stability over centimeter&#8208;scale areas.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is crucial to generate clean hydrogen fuel, but implementation at an industrial scale remains limited due to dependence on expensive platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an all&#8208;dry process to transform electrochemically inert bulk WS2 into a multidomain electrochemical catalyst that enables scalable and cost&#8208;effective implementation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis is reported. Direct dry transfer of WS2 flakes to a gold thin film deposited on a silicon substrate provides a general platform to produce the working electrodes for HER with tunable charge transfer resistance. By treating the mechanically exfoliated WS2 with sequential Ar&#8208;O2 plasma, mixed domains of WS2, WO3, and tungsten oxysulfide form on the surfaces of the flakes, which gives rise to a superior HER with much greater long&#8208;term stability and steady&#8208;state activity compared to Pt. Using density functional theory, ultraefficient atomic sites formed on the constituent nanodomains are identified, and the quantification of atomic&#8208;scale reactivities and resulting HER activities fully support the experimental observations.

Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries are the leading candidates as the next&#8208;generation power source for flexible/wearable electronics. However, constructing the safe and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, by adopting the natural and robust cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as building blocks, the biomass SSEs with penetrating ion and water channels are constructed by knitting the OH&#8722;&#8208;conductive CNFs and water&#8208;retentive CNFs together via an energy&#8208;efficient tape casting. Benefiting from the abundant ion and water channels with interconnected hydrated OH&#8722; wires for fast OH&#8722; conduction under nanoconfined environment, the biomass SSEs reveal the high water&#8208;uptake, impressive OH&#8722; conductivity of 175 mS&#183;cm&#8722;1 and mechanical robustness simultaneously, which overcomes the commonly existed dilemma between ion conductivity and mechanical property. Remarkably, the flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with biomass SSEs deliver exceptional cycle lifespan of 310 hours and power density of 126 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2. The design methodology for water and ion channels opens a new avenue to design high&#8208;performance SSEs for batteries.

         <title>Wearable Coaxially&#8208;shielded Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent advancements in metamaterials have yielded the possibility of a wireless solution to improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike traditional closely packed local coil arrays with rigid designs and numerous components, these lightweight, cost&#8208;effective metamaterials eliminate the need for radio frequency cabling, baluns, adapters, and interfaces. However, their clinical adoption has been limited by their low sensitivity, bulky physical footprint, and limited, specific use cases. Herein, we introduce a wearable metamaterial developed using commercially available coaxial cable, designed for a 3.0 T MRI system. This metamaterial inherits the coaxially&#8208;shielded structure of its constituent cable, confining the electric field within and mitigating coupling to its surroundings. This ensures safer clinical adoption, lower signal loss, and resistance to frequency shifts. Weighing only 50&#160;g, the metamaterial maximizes its sensitivity by conforming to the anatomical region of interest. MRI images acquired using this metamaterial with various pulse sequences achieve an SNR comparable or even surpass that of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 16&#8208;channel knee coil. This work introduces a novel paradigm for constructing metamaterials in the MRI environment, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation wireless MRI technology.

         <title>Electronic Spin Alignment within Homologous NiS2/NiSe2 Heterostructures to Promote Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The catalytic activation of the Li&#8208;S reaction is fundamental to maximizing the capacity and stability of Li&#8208;S batteries (LSBs) by blocking the migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and enhancing sulfur utilization. Current research on Li&#8208;S catalysts mainly focuses on the optimization of the energy levels to promote adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, while frequently overlooking the electronic spin state influence on charge transfer and orbital interactions. Here, hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (NiS2/NiSe2@NC) are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructure promotes the spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin, and thereby generating additional unpaired electrons. The high spin configuration orbit of NiS2/NiSe2@NC raises the electronic energy level and activates the electronic state. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectra, and density functional theory results show that the activated electronic state accelerates the charge transfer and the regulated d&#8208;band center optimizes the adsorption energy, lowering the reaction energy barrier of the LiPSs conversion rate&#8208;determining step. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses further reveal that the spin polarization associated with the formed heterostructures can accelerate the sulfur conversion kinetics. Benefiting from these characteristics, LSBs based on NiS2/NiSe2@NC/S cathodes exhibit high initial capacity (1458 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (572 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 at 5C), and stable cycling with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.025% per cycle at 1C during 500 cycles. Even at a high sulfur loading (6.2 mg&#183;cm&#8211;2), a high initial capacity of 1173 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 (7.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2) is measured at 0.1C, and 1058 mAh&#183;g&#8211;1 is retained after 300 cycles. This work not only provides an effective strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of LSBs but also shows new insights into the role of spin polarization in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Deciphering the Performance Enhancement, Cell Failure Mechanism, and Amelioration Strategy of Sodium Storage in Metal Chalcogenides&#8208;Based Andes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether&#8208;based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. Our investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling&#8208;induced stress, being the main reason for ultra&#8208;stable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the micro&#8208;short&#8208;circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, we establish a predictive framework linking electrode longevity to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and micro&#8208;short&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Atomic Pt Sites Anchored in the Interface Between Grains on Vacancy&#8208;Enriched CeO2 Nanosheets: One&#8208;Step Precursor Combustion Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomic metal catalysts have unique electronic, structural and catalytic properties, which have been widely used in the field of catalysis. However, designing new simple synthesis methods to fabricate atomic metal catalysts is a challenge in catalytic applications. Herein, one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy is presented that starts directly from precursors of metal salts, using spontaneous combustion process convert platinum nitrate to atomic Pt sites. The atomic Pt sites with the low valence are anchored in the formed interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. The obtained Pt/CeO2&#8208;2 catalyst exhibits much higher three&#8208;way catalytic activities at low temperature than Pt/CeO2&#8208;C catalysts prepared using traditional impregnation method. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the generated lower valent Pt atoms in the CeO2 interface promote catalytic activity through reducing the energy barrier, and lead to an overall improvement of three&#8208;way catalytic activities. This facile strategy provides new insights to study the properties and applications of atomic noble metal catalysts.

         <title>Efficient Delivery of Lomitapide Using Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Coated Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructures for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds were screened based on a high&#8208;throughput drug screening platform and obtained a novel anti&#8208;GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP). Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM was constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate&#8208;modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results showed that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti&#8208;GBM activities, reduced off&#8208;target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan and had negligible side effects in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study combines high&#8208;throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood-brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds were screened based on a high-throughput drug screening platform and obtained a novel anti-GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP). Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM was constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate-modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results showed that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti-GBM activities, reduced off-target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan and had negligible side effects in tumor-bearing mice. This study combines high-throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Beyond Conventional Charge Density Wave for Strongly Enhanced Two&#8208;dimensional Superconductivity in 1H&#8208;TaS2 Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers offer a fertile platform for exploring unconventional Ising superconductivity (SC) and charge density waves (CDWs). However, the vulnerability of isolated monolayers to structural disorder and environmental oxidation often degrade their electronic coherence. Herein, we report an alternative approach for fabricating stable and intrinsic monolayers of 1H&#8208;TaS2 sandwiched between SnS blocks in a (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals (vdW) superlattice. The SnS block layers not only decouple individual 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers to endow them with monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics, but also protect the 1H&#8208;TaS2 layers from electronic degradation. The results reveal the characteristic 3 &#215; 3 CDW order in 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers associated with electronic rearrangement in the low&#8208;lying S p band, which uncovers a previously undiscovered CDW mechanism rather than the conventional Fermi surface&#8208;related framework. Additionally, the (SnS)1.15TaS2 superlattice exhibits a strongly enhanced Ising&#8208;like SC with a layer&#8208;independent Tc of approximately 3.0 K, comparable to that of the isolated monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 sample, presumably attributed to their monolayer&#8208;like characteristics and retained Fermi states. Our results provide new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and enhanced SC of monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2, establishing bulk vdW superlattices as promising platforms for investigating exotic collective quantum phases in the two&#8208;dimensional limit.

         <title>Towards Intelligent Display with Neuromorphic Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the era of the Internet and the Internet of Things, display technology has evolved significantly toward full&#8208;scene display and realistic display. Incorporating &#8216;intelligence&#8217; into displays is a crucial technical approach to meet the demands of this development. Traditional display technology relies on distributed hardware systems to achieve intelligent displays but encounters challenges stemming from the physical separation of sensing, processing, and light&#8208;emitting modules. The high energy consumption and data transformation delays limited the development of intelligence display, breaking the physical separation is crucial to overcoming the bottlenecks of intelligence display technology. Inspired by the biological neural system, neuromorphic technology with all&#8208;in&#8208;one features is widely employed across various fields. It proves effective in reducing system power consumption, facilitating frequent data transformation, and enabling cross&#8208;scene integration. Neuromorphic technology shows great potential to overcome display technology bottlenecks, realizing the full&#8208;scene display and realistic display with high efficiency and low power consumption. In this review, we offer a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in the application of neuromorphic technology in displays, with a focus on interoperability. We delve into its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art designs and potential future developments aimed at revolutionizing display technology.

         <title>Photochemical Design for Diverse Controllable Patterns in Self&#8208;Wrinkling Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Harnessing the spontaneous surface instability of pliable substances to create intricate, well&#8208;ordered, and on&#8208;demand controlled surface patterns holds great potential for advancing applications in optical, electrical, and biological processes. However, the current limitations stem from challenges in modulating multi&#8208;directional stress fields and diverse boundary environments. Herein, we propose a universal strategy to achieve arbitrarily controllable wrinkle patterns via the spatiotemporal photochemical boundaries. Utilizing constraints and inductive effects of the photochemical boundaries, the multiple coupling relationship is accomplished among the light fields, stress fields, and morphology of wrinkles in photosensitive polyurethane (PSPU) film. Moreover, employing sequential light&#8208;irradiation with photomask enables the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly ordered 2D patterns to periodic or intricate designs. The fundamental mechanics of underlying buckling and the formation of surface features are comprehensively elucidated through theoretical stimulation and finite element analysis. The results reveal the evolution laws of wrinkles under photochemical boundaries and represent a new effective toolkit for fabricating intricate and captivating patterns in single&#8208;layer films.

         <title>Record&#8208;Efficiency Printable Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by the Multifunctional Schiff Base Derivative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record power conversion efficiency of 19.74% is achieved for the printable hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based mesoscopic perovskite solar cell by introducing the multifunctional additive of (chloromethylene) dimethyliminium chloride (CDCl). As a Stiff base derivative, CDCl interacts well with TiO2 and perovskite, which induces modulated energy level alignment and enhanced crystallinity of perovskite in mesopores for the enhanced device performance.








Abstract
Tailoring multifunctional additives for performing interfacial modifications, improving crystallization, and passivating defects is instrumental for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a Schiff base derivative, (chloromethylene) dimethyliminium chloride (CDCl), is introduced as an additive to modify the interface between the mesoporous TiO2 electron transport layer and the MAPbI3 light absorber during the annealing process. CDCl chemically links to TiO2 and MAPbI3 through coordination and hydrogen bonding, respectively, and results in the construction of fast electron extraction channels. CDCl also optimizes the energy&#8208;level alignment of the TiO2/MAPbI3 heterojunction and improves the pore&#8208;filling and crystallization of MAPbI3 in the mesoscopic scaffold, which inhibits nonradiative recombination and eliminates open&#8208;circuit voltage losses. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.74%, which is the best one ever reported, is obtained for printable carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free PSCs based on MAPbI3.

         <title>Stabilizing Ni2+ in Hollow Nano MOF/Polymetallic Phosphides Composites for Enhanced Electrochemical Performance in 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni, which has stronger coordination ability with N, is introduced into the nano Co&#8208;MOF composite material to partially replace Co, and the hollow nanostructure is stabilized through low&#8208;temperature controllable formation rate of multi metal phosphides. The generation of Ni, Co, and P atoms during the reduction process effectively enhances the electron transfer rate within the framework.








Abstract
Polymetallic phosphides exhibit favorable conductivities. A reasonable design of nano&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frame (MOF) composite morphologies and in situ introduction of polymetallic phosphides into the framework can effectively improve electrolyte penetration and rapid electron transfer. To address existing challenges, Ni, with a strong coordination ability with N, is introduced to partially replace Co in nano&#8208;Co&#8211;MOF composite. The hollow nanostructure is stabilized through CoNi bimetallic coordination and low&#8208;temperature controllable polymetallic phosphide generation rate. The Ni, Co, and P atoms, generated during reduction, effectively enhance electron transfer rate within the framework. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) characterization results further confirm the existence of Ni&#8211;N, Ni&#8211;Ni, and Co&#8211;Co structures in the nanocomposite. The changes in each component during the charge&#8211;discharge process of the electrochemical reactions are investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Theoretical calculations further confirm that P can effectively improve conductivity. VZNPGC//MXene MSCs, constructed with active materials derived from the hollow nano MOF composites synthesized through the Ni2+ stabilization strategy, demonstrate a specific capacitance of 1184 mF cm&#8722;2, along with an energy density of 236.75 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (power density of 0.14 mW cm&#8722;2). This approach introduces a new direction for the synthesis of highly conductive nano&#8208;MOF composites.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Chemical&#8208;Gated Hydrogel Actuation Systems for Information 3D&#8208;Encoding Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By replicating the chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscles for on&#8208;demand color/pattern display, a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction gating strategy is proposed to dynamically program and gate the thermoresponsiveness of smart hydrogel actuators after material manufacture, followed by the demonstration of robust chemical&#8208;gated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding information carriers with enhanced display security.








Abstract
Cephalopods evolve the acetylcholine&#8208;gated actuation control function of their skin muscles, which enables their dynamic/static multimode display capacities for achieving perfectly spatial control over the colors/patterns on every inch of skin. Reproduction of artificial analogs that exhibit similar multimodal display is essential to reach advanced information three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding with higher security than the classic 2D&#8208;encoding strategy, but remains underdeveloped. The core difficulty is how to replicate such chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function into artificial soft actuating systems. Herein, this work proposes to develop azobenzene&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogel systems, whose upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type actuation responsiveness can be intelligently programmed or even gated by the addition of hydrophilic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) molecules for reversible association with pendant azobenzene moieties via supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions. By employing such &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated hydrogel actuator as an analogue of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscle, biomimetic mechanically modulated multicolor fluorescent display systems are designed, which demonstrate a conceptually new &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated &#8220;thermal stimulation&#8208;hydrogel actuation&#8208;fluorescence output&#8221; display mechanism. Consequently, high&#8208;security 3D&#8208;encoding information carriers with an unprecedented combination of single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output, dynamic/static dual&#8208;mode and spatially controlled display capacities are achieved. This bioinspired strategy brings functional&#8208;integrated features for artificial display systems and opens previously unidentified avenues for information security.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Perylene Derivative Ladder Polymer with Antiambipolarity for Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type, &#960;&#8208;extended poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione) ladder polymer with good backbone planarity, predominant edge&#8208;on packing, and porous structure exhibits excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic transport properties and enables high&#8208;performing organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Additionally, the OECT shows stable reversible antiambipolar characteristics. Electrically reconfigurable logic gates, with the dynamic capability of realizing AND, NOR, OR, and NAND gates are accomplished with this single polymer.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are one of the promising building blocks to realize next&#8208;generation bioelectronics. To date, however, the performance and signal processing capabilities of these devices remain limited by their stability and speed. Herein, the authors demonstrate stable and fast n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors based on a side&#8208;chain&#8208;free ladder polymer, poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione). The device demonstrated fast normalized transient speed of 0.56 &#177; 0.17 ms&#160;um&#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability in aqueous electrolytes, with no significant drop in its doping current after 50&#8239;000 successive doping/dedoping cycles and 2&#8208;month storage at ambient conditions. These unique characteristics make this polymer especially suitable for bioelectronics, such as being used as a pull&#8208;down channel in a complementary inverter for long&#8208;term stable detection of electrophysiological signals. Moreover, the developed device shows a reversible anti&#8208;ambipolar behavior, enabling reconfigurable electronics to be realized using a single material. These results go beyond the conventional OECT and demonstrate the potential of OECTs to exhibit dynamically configurable functionalities for next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics.

         <title>Realization of Fine&#8208;Tuning the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Anharmonicity in Layered Semiconductors via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range mixing entropy engineering is realized in a series of layered semiconductors. Dominating Umklapp three&#8208;phonon scattering process mechanism is revealed by the linear &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 behavior. Fine tuning of lattice thermal conductivity is achieved with an almost linear &#916;Smix dependence. The slope of the &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 curve reduces with increasing &#916;Smix, revealing a linear response to the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter.








Abstract
Entropy engineering is widely proven to be effective in achieving ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity for well&#8208;performed thermoelectric and heat management applications. However, no strong correlation between entropy and lattice thermal conductivity is found until now, and the fine&#8208;tuning of thermal conductivity continuously via entropy&#8208;engineering in a wide entropy range is still lacking. Here, a series of high&#8208;entropy layered semiconductors, Ni1&#8722;x(Fe0.25Co0.25Mn0.25Zn0.25)xPS3, where 0 &#8804; x &lt; 1, with low mass/size disorder is designed. High&#8208;purity samples with mixing configuration entropy of metal atomic site in a wide range of 0&#8211;1.61R are achieved. Umklapp phonon&#8208;phonon scattering is found to be the dominating phonon scattering mechanism, as revealed by the linear T&#8722;1 dependence of thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity via continuous entropy engineering at metal atomic sites is achieved, in an almost linear dependence in middle&#8208;/high&#8208; entropy range. Moreover, the slope of the &#954;&#160;&#8208; T&#8722;1 curve reduces with the increase in entropy, and a linear response of the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter is revealed. This work provides an entropy engineering strategy by choosing multiple metal elements with low mass/size disorder to achieve the fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity and the anharmonic effect.

         <title>In Situ Synthesized Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite for &gt;25% Efficiency Stable MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective additive (BAH2) is in situ synthesized in perovskite precursor solution by a two&#8208;step addition reaction of but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;amine hydrochloride (BAH) toward formamidinium iodide (FAI) to regulate nucleation and growth of perovskite film along preferred orientation and release lattice strain by forming a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite. Consequently, the BAH&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 25.19% and improved stability.








Abstract
Developing an additive to effectively regulate the perovskite crystallization kinetics for the optimized optoelectronic properties of perovskite film plays a vital role in obtaining high efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new additive is designed and directly synthesized in perovskite precursor solution by utilizing an addition reaction between but&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;amine hydrochloride (BAH) and formamidinium iodide. It is found that its product may control the intermediate precursor phase for regulating perovskite nucleation, leading to advantageous 2D perovskite to induce growth of perovskite along the preferred [001] orientation with not only released lattice strain but also strong interaction with perovskite to passivate its surface defects. By taking advantage of the above synergistic effects, the optimized PSC delivers an efficiency of 25.19% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.22 V. Additionally, the devices demonstrate good stability, remaining over 90% of their initial efficiencies under ambient atmosphere conditions for 60 days, high temperature of 85&#160;&#176;C for 200 h, or maximum power point tracking for 500 h.

         <title>Degradation Mechanisms of Electrodes Promotes Direct Regeneration of Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has attracted considerable attention compared to traditional recycling methods. Only by having an adequate understanding of degradation mechanisms and defective types of failed materials can be found more suitable and efficient methods for direct repairing spent LIBs. A comprehensive overview of degradation mechanisms and regeneration methods for spent LIBs is provided.








Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle use is expected to cause a significant environmental problem in the next few years due to the large number of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Recycling spent LIBs will not only alleviate the environmental problems but also address the challenge of limited natural resources shortages. While several hydro&#8208; and pyrometallurgical processes are developed for recycling different components of spent batteries, direct regeneration presents clear environmental, and economic advantages. The principle of the direct regeneration approach is restoring the electrochemical performance by healing the defective structure of the spent materials. Thus, the development of direct regeneration technology largely depends on the formation mechanism of defects in spent LIBs. This review systematically details the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs are outlined. Also the main challenges and solutions for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs are proposed. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium&#8208;ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.

         <title>Kornblum Oxidation Reaction&#8208;Induced Collective Transformation of Lead Polyhalides for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that effective suppression of vacancy defects can be achieved by a rapid collective transformation of lead polyhalides through&#160;the Kornblum oxidation reaction of &#945;&#8208;iodo ketone that releases halide ions. As a result, the best thermal stability of formamidinium&#8211;cesium mixed&#8208;cation compositions (FACs)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is achieved.








Abstract
The iodide vacancy defects generated during the perovskite crystallization process are a common issue that limits the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although excessive ionic iodides have been used to compensate for these vacancies, they are not effective in reducing defects through modulating the perovskite crystallization. Moreover, these iodide ions present in the perovskite films can act as interstitial defects, which are detrimental to the stability of the perovskite. Here, an effective approach to suppress the formation of vacancy defects by manipulating the coordination chemistry of lead polyhalides during perovskite crystallization is demonstrated. To achieve this suppression, an &#945;&#8208;iodo ketone is introduced to undergo a process of Kornblum oxidation reaction that releases halide ions. This process induces a rapid collective transformation of lead polyhalides during the nucleation process and significantly reduces iodide vacancy defects. As a result, the ion mobility is decreased by one order of magnitude in perovskite film and the PSC achieves significantly improved thermal stability, maintaining 82% of its initial power conversion efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C for 2800&#160;h. These findings highlight the potential of halide ions released by the Kornblum oxidation reaction, which can be widely used for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Fluorophores: Ultrabright Fluorescent Supramolecular Assemblies Derived from Conventional Fluorophores in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent supramolecular assemblies in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in Supra&#8208;fluorophores with high brightness.








Abstract
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts are invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. This study presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, this course has employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide&#8208;diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#160;060 m&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 nm&#8722;3). Moreover, high&#8208;performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20&#8208;fold increase in both brightness and photostability. This Supra&#8208;fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.

         <title>Pyroelectric Photoconductive Diode for Highly Sensitive and Fast DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detecting high&#8208;energy photons from the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to X&#8208;rays is vital in security, medicine, industry, and science. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors exhibit great potential for detecting high&#8208;energy photons. However, the implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors based on WBG semiconductors has been a huge challenge due to the inevitable deep level traps and the lack of appropriate device structure engineering. Here, a sensitive and fast pyroelectric photoconductive diode (PPD), which couples the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on tailored polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx (PGR&#8208;GaOX) Schottky photodiode, was first proposed. The PPD device exhibits ultra&#8208;high detection performance for deep&#8208;DUV and X&#8208;ray light. The responsivity for DUV light and sensitivity for X&#8208;ray are up to 104 A/W and 105 &#956;C&#8901;Gyair&#8722;1/cm2, respectively. Especially, the interface pyroelectric effect induced by polar symmetry in the depletion region of the PGR&#8208;GaOX can significantly improve the response speed of the device by 105 times. Furthermore, the potential of the device has been demonstrated for imaging enhancement systems with low power consumption and high sensitivity. This work fully excavates the potential of the pyroelectric effect for detectors and provides a novel design strategy to achieve sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Co&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate to Urea with High Faradaic Efficiency on Cobalt&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co&#8208;reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on&#8208;site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large&#8208;scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C&#8208;N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) is proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C&#8208;N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea&#8208;producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mgcat.&#8211;1, much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactants diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces&#8208;electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high&#8208;rate formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis.

         <title>Assembled/Disassembled Modular Scaffolds for Multicellular Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicellular tissue engineering scaffolds with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types are successfully constructed through the strategy of assembling 3D printed modules loaded with different kinds of cells. Assembled/disassembled modular scaffolds can not only be used for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross&#8208;talk, but also be utilized as cell&#8208;laden implants for the regeneration of complex tissue.








Abstract
The behavior of tissue resident cells can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of cellular interactions. Therefore, it is of significance to precisely control the spatial organization of various cells within multicellular constructs. It remains challenging to construct a versatile multicellular scaffold with ordered spatial organization of multiple cell types. Herein, a modular multicellular tissue engineering scaffold with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types is constructed by assembling varying cell&#8208;laden modules. Interestingly, the modular scaffolds can be disassembled into individual modules to evaluate the specific contribution of each cell type in the system. Through assembling cell&#8208;laden modules, the macrophage&#8208;mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), endothelial cell&#8208;MSC, and chondrocyte&#8208;MSC co&#8208;culture models are successfully established. The in vitro results indicate that the intercellular cross&#8208;talk can promote the proliferation and differentiation of each cell type in the system. Moreover, MSCs in the modular scaffolds may regulate the behavior of chondrocytes through the nuclear factor of activated T&#8208;Cells (NFAT) signaling pathway. Furthermore, the modular scaffolds loaded with co&#8208;cultured chondrocyte&#8208;MSC exhibit enhanced regeneration ability of osteochondral tissue, compared with other groups. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy to construct a multicellular tissue engineering scaffold for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross&#8208;talk and complex tissue engineering.

         <title>Neutrophil Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Polyprodrug Nanomedicine for Inflammation Suppression in Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutrophil membrane&#8208;coated reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polyprodrug nanoparticle (NRN) is reported for the ischemic brain&#8208;targeted delivery of fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) with minimal side effects. NRNs exhibit enhanced blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, ischemic brain&#8208;targeted accumulation, and effective neuroprotection with minimal side effects owing to neutrophil membrane coating and ROS&#8208;responsive FTY720 release.








Abstract
Neuroinflammation has emerged as a major concern in ischemic stroke therapy because it exacebates neurological dysfunction and suppresses neurological recovery after ischemia/reperfusion. Fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) is an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;inflammatory drug which exhibits potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain parenchyma. However, delivering a sufficient amount of FTY720 through the blood&#8211;brain barrier into brain lesions without inducing severe cardiovascular side effects remains challenging. Here, a neutrophil membrane&#8208;camouflaged polyprodrug nanomedicine that can migrate into ischemic brain tissues and in situ release FTY720 in response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. This nanomedicine delivers 15.2&#8208;fold more FTY720 into the ischemic brain and significantly reduces the risk of cardiotoxicity and infection compared with intravenously administered free drug. In addition, single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis identifies that the nanomedicine attenuates poststroke inflammation by reprogramming microglia toward anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotypes, which is realized via modulating Cebpb&#8208;regulated activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and secretion of CXCL2 chemokine. This study offers new insights into the design and fabrication of polyprodrug nanomedicines for effective suppression of inflammation in ischemic stroke therapy.

         <dc:description>
Symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed. The polarization dependence of the SHG signals is significantly modified, and the signal magnitude is enhanced by one order of magnitude under a finite magnetic field, which can be explained by the magnetoelectric effect.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique magnetoelectric or magnetooptical properties. The recent discovery of few&#8208;layer van der Waals&#160;multiferroic crystals provides a new research direction for controlling the multiferroic properties in the atomic layer limit. However, research on few&#8208;layer multiferroic crystals is limited and the effect of thickness&#8208;dependent symmetries on those properties is less explored. In this study, the symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by optical second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed by the temperature&#8208;dependent SHG signals, revealing significant changes by applying the magnetic field reflecting the magnetoelectric effect. Moreover, it is found that symmetries and resultant magnetoelectric responses can be modulated by the number of layers. These results offer a new principle of controlling the multiferroicity and indicate that 2D van der Waals multiferroic material is a promising building block for functional nanodevices.

         <title>Ultrahigh Nonlinear Responses from MXene Plasmons in the Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an important discovery regarding the optical properties of MXenes, demonstrating that 2D Ti3C2Tx generates a strong plasmonic phenomenon in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared range through acoustic plasmon modes. Additionally, this finding is leveraged to achieve record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficients at short&#8208;wavelength infrared wavelengths.








Abstract
Surface plasmons in 2D materials such as graphene exhibit exceptional field confinement. However, the low electron density of majority of 2D materials, which are semiconductors or semimetals, has limited their plasmons to mid&#8208;wave or long&#8208;wave infrared regime. This study demonstrates that a 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene with high electron density can not only support strong plasmon confinement with an acoustic plasmon mode in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, but also provide ultrahigh nonlinear responses. The acoustic MXene plasmons (AMPs) in the MXene (Ti3C2Tx)&#8211;insulator (SiO2)&#8211;metal (Au) nanostructure generate in the 1.5&#8211;6.0 &#181;m wavelength range, exhibiting a two orders of magnitude reduction in wavelength compared to wavelength in free space. Furthermore, AMP resonators with patterned Au rods exhibit a record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficient of 1.37 &#215; 10&#8722;2 m&#160;W&#8722;1 at wavelength of 1.56 &#181;m, &#8776;3 orders of magnitude greater than the highest value recorded for other 2D materials. These results indicate that MXenes can overcome fundamental plasmon wavelength limitations of previously studied 2D materials, providing groundbreaking opportunities in nonlinear optical applications, including all&#8208;optical processing and ultrafast optical switching.

         <title>Spontaneous Wetting Induced by Contact&#8208;Electrification at Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a droplet spreads on a polymer surface, simultaneous charge exchange occurs at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Repeated contact electrification leads to accumulated charges on the substrate, inducing spontaneous wetting phenomena. Contact angle variation strongly depends on surface charge density. Contact electrification induced wetting (CEW) can alter contact angles by 5&#176;~38&#176; across different materials.








Abstract
Wettability significantly influences various surface interactions and applications at the liquid&#8211;solid interface. However, the understanding is complicated by the intricate charge exchange occurring through contact electrification (CE) during this process. The understanding of the influence of triboelectric charge on wettability remains challenging, especially due to the complexities involved in concurrently measuring contact angles and interfacial electrical signals. Here, the relationship is investigated between surface charge density and change of contact angle of dielectric films after contact with water droplets. It is observed that the charge exchange when water spared lead to a spontaneous wetting phenomenon, which is termed as the contact electrification induced wetting (CEW). Notably, these results demonstrate a linear dependence between the change of contact angle (CA) of the materials and the density of surface charge on the solid surface. Continuous CEW tests show that not only the static CA but also the dynamics of wetting are influenced by the accumulation charges at the interface. The mechanism behind CEW involves the redistribution of surface charges on a solid surface and polar water molecules within liquid. This interaction results in a decrease in interface energy, leading to a reduction in the CA. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduction in interface energy may stem from the enhanced surface charge on the substrate, which strengthens the hydrogen bond interaction between water and the substrate. These findings have the potential to advance the understanding of CE and wetting phenomena, with applications in energy harvesting, catalysis, and droplet manipulation at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces.

         <title>Photoluminescent Characterization of Metal Nanoclusters: Basic Parameters, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of luminescent materials. Photoluminescent characterization plays a huge role in revealing the luminescent mechanism of nanoclusters and designing nanocluster&#8208;based applications. This review discusses the parameters and measurement methods in characterizing luminescent nanoclusters from the basic principles to the revelation of luminescent mechanisms and construction of practical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) can be synthesized with atomically precise structures and molecule formulae due to the rapid development of nanocluster science in recent decades. The ultrasmall size range (normally &lt; 2 nm) endows MNCs with plenty of molecular&#8208;like properties, among which photoluminescent properties have aroused extensive attention. Tracing the research and development processes of luminescent nanoclusters, various photoluminescent analysis and characterization methods play a significant role in elucidating luminescent mechanism and analyzing luminescent properties. In this review, it is aimed to systematically summarize the normally used photoluminescent characterizations in MNCs including basic parameters and methods, such as excitation/emission wavelength, quantum yield, and lifetime. For each key parameter, first its definition and meaning is introduced and then the relevant characterization methods including measuring principles and the revelation of luminescent properties from the collected data are discussed. Then, it is discussed in details how to explore the luminescent mechanism of MNCs and construct NC&#8208;based applications based on the measured data. By means of these characterization strategies, the luminescent properties of MNCs and NC&#8208;based designs can be explained quantitatively and qualitatively. Hence, this review is expected to provide clear guidance for researchers to characterize luminescent MNCs and better understand the luminescent mechanism from the measured results.

         <title>Red Carbon Mediated Formation of Cu2O Clusters Dispersed on the Oxocarbon Framework by Fehling's Route and their Use for the Nitrate Electroreduction in Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, Cu2O clusters are obtained dispersedly on the oxocarbon framework after the Fehling's&#8208;like reaction during the mild annealing process of red carbon, leading to the reduction of Cu (II) predominantly to Cu2O. The covalent oxocarbon framework improves the stability of clusters, enabling their efficient nitrate electroreduction under acidic electrolytes with a high yield rate and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The oligomers of carbon suboxide, known as red carbon, exhibit a highly conjugated structure and semiconducting properties. Upon mild heat treatment, it transforms into a carbonaceous framework rich in oxygen surface terminations, called oxocarbon. In this study, the abundant oxygen functionalities are harnessed as anchors to create oxocarbon&#8208;supported nanohybrid electrocatalysts. Starting with single atomic Cu (II) strongly coordinated to oxygen atoms on red carbon, the Fehling reaction leads to the formation of Cu2O clusters. Simultaneously, a covalent oxocarbon framework emerges via cross&#8208;linking, providing robust support for Cu2O clusters. Notably, the oxocarbon support effectively stabilizes Cu2O clusters of very small size, ensuring their high durability in acidic conditions and the presence of ammonia. The synthesized material exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity for nitrate reduction under acidic electrolyte conditions, with a high yield rate of ammonium (NH4+) at 3.31&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at a potential of &#8722;0.4&#160;V (vs RHE).

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Performance in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Through Hydrogen Bond Suppression of Organic Cation Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High background carrier density in FASnI3 transistors is elucidated, originating from both Sn2+ oxidation and FA+ ion migration. The development of a hydrogen bond strategy through the integration of fluorine&#8208;substituted additives effectively suppresses cation migration, thereby reducing background carrier density and enhancing operational stability of the transistors. An impressive effective mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI3 FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn2+ but also from the migration of FA+ ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA+ and F&#8722; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine&#8208;substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn&#8208;on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with an Ion/off ratio of 107 is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin&#8208;based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.

         <title>The Potential Regulation of Working Anode for Long&#8208;Term Zero&#8208;Volt Storage at 37&#160;&#176;C in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at 37&#160;&#176;C is achieved through quantitative regulation of anode potential in working cells. This approach prevents Cu current collector dissolution and SEI degradation by controlling the Li6CoO4 content in cathode, with reversible capacity in slight over&#8208;lithiation LCO demonstrated. This paves the way for emerging applications in active implantable medical devices.








Abstract
The advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries that can tolerate zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) are in high demand for implantable medical devices and spacecraft. However, ZVS can raise the anode potential, leading to Cu current collector dissolution and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation, especially at 37&#160;&#176;C. In this contribution, by quantitatively regulating the dosage of Li6CoO4 cathode additives, controllable potential of the working anode under abusive&#8208;discharge conditions is demonstrated. The addition of Li6CoO4 keeps zero&#8208;crossing potential (ZCP) and the potential of ZVS below 2.0 V (vs Li/Li+) for LiCoO2|mesocarbon microbead cells at 37&#160;&#176;C. The capacity retention ratio (CRR) increases from 69.1% and 35.9% to 98.6% and 90.8% after 10 and 20 days of ZVS, respectively. The Cu dissolution and SEI degradation are effectively suppressed, while the over&#8208;lithiated cathode exhibits high reversible capacity after ZVS. The limiting conditions of long&#8208;term ZVS are further explored and a corresponding guide map is designed. When quantitatively regulating ZCP and the potential in ZVS, Cu dissolution, SEI degradation, and irreversible conversion of the cathode constitute the limiting conditions. This contribution designs the most reasonable potential range for ZVS protection at 37&#160;&#176;C, and realizes the best CRR record through precise potential regulation for the first time.

         <title>Enhanced Piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 by the Introduction of MXene and Its Utilization in Boosting High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research details a strategy to boost the piezoelectric performance of MAPbI3 by using a MXene substrate. It is demonstrated that the surface OH groups on the MXene induce a stronger polarization of the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 compared to that of the O and F groups, leading to a much more enhanced piezoelectric effect. An innovative type of flexible photodetector (PD) based on a piezoelectric MXene/MAPbI3 heterostructure is crafted, which can be enhanced simultaneously by the piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects. Utilizing MXene to boost the piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 reveals wide&#8208;range potentials for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Recently, perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are risen to prominence due to substantial research interest. Beyond merely tweaking the composition of materials, a cutting&#8208;edge advancement lies in leveraging the innate piezoelectric polarization properties of perovskites themselves. Here, the investigation shows utilizing Ti3C2Tx, a typical MXene, as an intermediate layer for significantly boosting the piezoelectric property of MAPbI3 thin films. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced polarization of the methylammonium (MA+) groups within MAPbI3, induced by the OH groups present in Ti3C2Tx. A flexible PD based on the MAPbI3/MXene heterostructure is then fabricated. The new device is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths, displays greatly enhanced performance owing to the piezo&#8208;phototronic coupling. Moreover, the device is endowed with a greatly reduced response time, down to millisecond level, through the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro&#8208;phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects can be employed to design high&#8208;performance flexible perovskite PDs.

         <title>Prevented Cell Clusters&#8217; Migration Via Microdot Biomaterials for Inhibiting Scar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cluster&#8208;like collective cell migration of fibroblasts is one of the main factors of adhesion in injured tissues. In this research, a microdot biomaterial system was constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles, which were prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;N&#8208;carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) and lactide, respectively. The microdot biomaterial system slowly released functionalized polypeptides targeting mitochondria and promoting the influx of extracellular calcium ions under the inflammatory environment, thus inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin mediating cell&#8208;cell interaction, and promoting apoptosis of cluster fibroblasts, synergistically inhibiting the migration of fibroblast clusters at the site of tendon injury. Meanwhile, the anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles in the microdot biomaterial system were celecoxib (Cex) solubilized by PEG/polyester, which could improve the inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site for a long time. In vitro, the microdot biomaterial system could effectively inhibit the migration of the cluster fibroblasts by inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin between cell&#8208;cell and promoting apoptosis. In vivo, the microdot biomaterial system could promote apoptosis while achieving long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;inflammation effects, and reduce the expression of vimentin and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts. Thus, this microdot biomaterial system provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of tendon adhesion by inhibiting the cluster migration of fibroblasts.

Abstract
Skin&#8208;interfaced high&#8208;sensitive biosensing systems to detect electrophysiological and biochemical signals have shown great potential in personal health monitoring and disease management. However, the integration of 3D porous nanostructures for improved sensitivity and various functional composites for signal transduction/processing/transmission often relies on different materials and complex fabrication processes, leading to weak interfaces prone to failure upon fatigue or mechanical deformations. The integrated system also needs additional adhesive to strongly conform to the human skin, which can also cause irritation, alignment issues, and motion artifacts. This work introduces a skin&#8208;attachable, reprogrammable, multifunctional, adhesive device patch fabricated by simple and low&#8208;cost laser scribing of an adhesive composite with polyimide powders and amine&#8208;based ethoxylated polyethylenimine dispersed in the silicone elastomer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin-interfaced high-sensitive biosensing systems to detect electrophysiological and biochemical signals have shown great potential in personal health monitoring and disease management. However, the integration of 3D porous nanostructures for improved sensitivity and various functional composites for signal transduction/processing/transmission often relies on different materials and complex fabrication processes, leading to weak interfaces prone to failure upon fatigue or mechanical deformations. The integrated system also needs additional adhesive to strongly conform to the human skin, which can also cause irritation, alignment issues, and motion artifacts. This work introduces a skin-attachable, reprogrammable, multifunctional, adhesive device patch fabricated by simple and low-cost laser scribing of an adhesive composite with polyimide powders and amine-based ethoxylated polyethylenimine dispersed in the silicone elastomer. The obtained laser-induced graphene (LIG) in the adhesive composite can be further selectively functionalized with conductive nanomaterials or enzymes for enhanced electrical conductivity or selective sensing of various sweat biomarkers. The possible combination of the sensors for real-time biofluid analysis and electrophysiological signal monitoring with RF energy harvesting and communication promises a standalone stretchable adhesive device platform based on the same material system and fabrication process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Solid&#8208;Liquid Bicontinuous Fiber with Strain&#8208;Insensitive Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission. Here we show that strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8208;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. We fabricated a bicontinuous fiber from polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self&#8208;wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivities to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain&#8208;induced distortion.

         <title>A Multimodal Self&#8208;Propelling Tensegrity Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tensegrity structure is composed of tensile cables and compressive rods, offering high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;mass ratio, deploy ability and excellent energy damping capability. The active and dynamic tensegrity designs demonstrate great potential for soft robots. In previous designs, the movement relied on carefully controlled input power or manually controlled light irradiation, limiting their potential applications. In this work, a hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, non&#8208;responsive cables and stiff rods. The HTS can self&#8208;propel continuously on a hot surface due to its unique geometry. The HTS allows for the easy achievement of multimodal self&#8208;propelled locomotive modes, which has been challenging for previously demonstrated self&#8208;propelling structures. Additionally, using Velcro tapes to adhere the rods and cables together, a modulable and re&#8208;assemblable HTS is created. The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self&#8208;propelling and modulable robots.

         <title>Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness was found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic&#8208;emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration&#8208;mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130&#8208;&#956;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

         <title>Evolution of Musculoskeletal Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The musculoskeletal system, constituting the largest human physiological system, plays a critical role in providing structural support to the body, facilitating intricate movements, and safeguarding internal organs. By virtue of advancements in revolutionized materials and devices, particularly in the realms of motion capture, health monitoring, and postoperative rehabilitation, &#8220;musculoskeletal electronics&#8221; has actually emerged as an infancy area, but has not yet been explicitly proposed. In this review, we attempt to elucidate the concept of musculoskeletal electronics, and summarize the evolution history, representative progress and key strategies of the involved materials and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Therefore, we first introduce the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories. Subsequently, we present recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics from the perspectives of &#8220;in&#8208;vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in&#8208;vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, we propose nine strategies avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.
