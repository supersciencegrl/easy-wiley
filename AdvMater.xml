      <title>Structure&#8211;Transport Correlation Reveals Anisotropic Charge Transport in Coupled PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocrystal superlattices exhibit favored directions for charge transport. Electronic and structural properties of microdomains of coupled PbS nanocrystal superlattices are correlatively investigated by conductivity and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction measurements. Highly ordered superlattices of iso&#8208;oriented nanocrystals show electrical transport anisotropy, a feature attractive for electronic applications, which has never been experimentally demonstrated for nanocrystal superlattices before.








Abstract
The assembly of colloidal semiconductive nanocrystals into highly ordered superlattices predicts novel structure&#8208;related properties by design. However, those structure&#8211;property relationships, such as charge transport depending on the structure or even directions of the superlattice, have remained unrevealed so far. Here, electric transport measurements and X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction are performed on self&#8208;assembled lead sulfide nanocrystal superlattices to investigate direction&#8208;dependent charge carrier transport in microscopic domains of these materials. By angular X&#8208;ray cross&#8208;correlation analysis, the structure and orientation of individual superlattices is determined, which are directly correlated with the electronic properties of the same microdomains. By that, strong evidence for the effect of superlattice crystallinity on the electric conductivity is found. Further, anisotropic charge transport in highly ordered monocrystalline domains is revealed, which is attributed to the dominant effect of shortest interparticle distance. This implies that transport anisotropy should be a general feature of weakly coupled nanocrystal superlattices.

      <title>Electrochemical Intercalation in Atomically Thin van der Waals Materials for Structural Phase Transition and Device Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on the electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures via versatile electrochemical platforms and their influence on the structural phase transition of materials and novel device applications is reviewed, and the future opportunities especially on the intercalation via solid ion conductor field effect transistors are discussed.








Abstract
In van der Waals (vdWs) materials and heterostructures, the interlayers are bonded by weak vdWs interactions due to the lack of dangling bonds. The vdWs gap at the homo&#8208; or heterointerface provides great freedom to enrich the tunability of electronic structures by external intercalation of foreign ions or atoms at the interface, leading to the discovery of new physics and functionalities. Herein, the recent progress on electrochemical intercalation of foreign species into atomically thin vdWs materials for structural phase transition and device applications is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. First, several kinds of electrochemical intercalation platforms to achieve the intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are introduced. Next, the in situ characterization of electrochemical intercalation dynamics by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques is summarized, including optical techniques, scanning probe techniques, and electrical transport. Moreover, particular attention is paid on the experimentally reported phase transition and multifunctional applications of intercalated devices. Finally, future applications and challenges of intercalation in vdWs materials and heterostructures are proposed, including the intrinsic intercalation mechanism of solid ion conductors, exact identification of intercalated foreign species by near&#8208;field optical techniques, and the tunability of intercalation kinetics for ultrafast switching.

      <title>Principles Governing Control of Aggregation and Dispersion of Graphene and Graphene Oxide in Polymer Melts</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling the dispersion and aggregation of graphene oxide (GO) is critical for harnessing its potential in many applications. This can be challenging as many competing factors contribute to its behavior in solution, and they are poorly understood. Using multiscale simulation, the key factors governing this behavior are mapped out and a framework for controlling the morphology of GO is proposed.








Abstract
Controlling the structure of graphene and graphene oxide (GO) phases is vitally important for any of its widespread intended applications: highly ordered arrangements of nanoparticles are needed for thin&#8208;film or membrane applications of GO, dispersed nanoparticles for composite materials, and 3D porous arrangements for hydrogels. By combining coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics and newly developed accurate models of GO, the driving forces that lead to the various morphologies are resolved. Two hydrophilic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), are used to illustrate the thermodynamically stable morphologies of GO and relevant dispersion mechanisms. GO self&#8208;assembly can be controlled by changing the degree of oxidation, varying from fully aggregated over graphitic domains to intercalated assemblies with polymer bilayers between sheets. The long&#8208;term stability of a dispersion is extremely important for many commercial applications of GO composites. For any degree of oxidation, GO does not disperse in PVA as a thermodynamic equilibrium product, whereas in PEG dispersions are only thermodynamically stable for highly oxidized GO. These findings&#8212;validated against the extensive literature on GO systems in organic solvents&#8212;furnish quantitative explanations for the empirically unpredictable aggregation characteristics of GO and provide computational methods to design directed synthesis routes for diverse self&#8208;assemblies and applications.

By combining coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics and newly developed accurate models of GO, the driving forces that lead to the various morphologies are resolved. Two hydrophilic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), are used to illustrate the thermodynamically stable morphologies of GO and relevant dispersion mechanisms. GO self&#8208;assembly can be controlled by changing the degree of oxidation, varying from fully aggregated over graphitic domains to intercalated assemblies with polymer bilayers between sheets. The long&#8208;term stability of a dispersion is extremely important for many commercial applications of GO composites. For any degree of oxidation, GO does not disperse in PVA as a thermodynamic equilibrium product, whereas in PEG dispersions are only thermodynamically stable for highly oxidized GO. These findings&#8212;validated against the extensive literature on GO systems in organic solvents&#8212;furnish quantitative explanations for the empirically unpredictable aggregation characteristics of GO and provide computational methods to design directed synthesis routes for diverse self&#8208;assemblies and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

In article number 2002166, Sang Seok Lee, Shin&#8208;Hyun Kim, and Sihun Park design onion&#8208;like photonic multishells with distinct photonic bandgaps. The multilayered structure is spontaneously created in emulsion drops by consecutive steps of phase separation between cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) and hydrophilic liquid, triggered by material exchange with the continuous phase. During the phase separation, a chiral dopant is unevenly partitioned in the CLC shells, resulting in multiple stopbands. The photonic multishells provide multi&#8208;wavelength lasing and advanced optical barcoding.

      <title>Diode&#8208;Like Selective Enhancement of Carrier Transport through Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interface Decorated by Monolayer Boron Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact is revealed through a comparison with conventional metal&#8211;semiconductor contact on a single monolayer MoS2 triangular domain. The MIS contact exploits monolayer hexagonal boron nitride as an ultrathin decorating layer added between MoS2 and metal contact.








Abstract
2D semiconductors such as monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are promising material candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, there are fundamental challenges related to their metal&#8211;semiconductor (MS) contacts, which limit the performance potential for practical device applications. In this work, 2D monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is exploited as an ultrathin decorating layer to form a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) contact, and an innovative device architecture is designed as a platform to reveal a novel diode&#8208;like selective enhancement of the carrier transport through the MIS contact. The contact resistance is significantly reduced when the electrons are transported from the semiconductor to the metal, but is barely affected when the electrons are transported oppositely. A concept of carrier collection barrier is proposed to interpret this intriguing phenomenon as well as a negative Schottky barrier height obtained from temperature&#8208;dependent measurements, and the critical role of the collection barrier at the drain end is shown for the overall transistor performance.

      <title>Water Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals Enables Air&#8208;Stable Intrinsically Stretchable Color&#8208;Conversion Layers for Stretchable Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
Here, an air&#8208;stable stretchable display consisting of an intrinsically stretchable electroluminescent device and perovskite nanocrystal (PeNCs) stretchable color conversion layer is proposed. Surprisingly, the increase in photoluminescence intensity of PeNCs in the water is proved to be caused by the surface passivation of moisture, which overcomes the water instability of perovskite materials.








Abstract
Conventional organic light&#8208;emitting devices without an encapsulation layer are susceptible to degradation when exposed to air, so realization of air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display is a great challenge because the protection of the devices against penetration of moisture and oxygen is even more difficult under stretching. An air&#8208;stable intrinsically&#8208;stretchable display that is composed of an intrinsically&#8208;stretchable electroluminescent device (SELD) integrated with a stretchable color&#8208;conversion layer (SCCL) that contains perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) is proposed. PeNCs normally decay when exposed to air, but they become resistant to this decay when dispersed in a stretchable elastomer matrix; this change is a result of a compatibility between capping ligands and the elastomer matrix. Counterintuitively, the moisture can efficiently passivate surface defects of PeNCs, to yield significant increases in both photoluminescence intensity and lifetime. A display that can be stretched up to 180% is demonstrated; it is composed of an air&#8208;stable SCCL that down&#8208;converts the SELD&#8217;s blue emission and reemits it as green. The work elucidates the basis of moisture&#8208;assisted surface passivation of PeNCs and provides a promising strategy to improve the quantum efficiency of PeNCs with the aid of moisture, which allows PeNCs to be applied for air&#8208;stable stretchable displays.

      <dc:description>
The application of nonaqueous Li&#8211;O2 batteries is limited by challenges from the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. The perspectives of porous materials for Li&#8211;O2 batteries are outlined, the advances of porous materials for targeting critical battery challenges are highlighted, rational design and future directions of porous&#8208;materials&#8208;based Li&#8211;O2 battery systems are suggested.








Abstract
Porous materials possessing high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore structure, superior tailorability, and dimensional effect have been widely applied as components of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. Herein, the theoretical foundation of the porous materials applied in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is provided, based on the present understanding of the battery mechanism and the challenges and advantageous qualities of porous materials. Furthermore, recent progress in porous materials applied as the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte in Li&#8211;O2 batteries is summarized, together with corresponding approaches to address the critical issues that remain at present. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of the correlation between the function&#8208;orientated design of porous materials and key challenges of Li&#8211;O2 batteries in accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, improving the electrode stability, controlling lithium deposition, suppressing the shuttle effect of the dissolved redox mediators, and alleviating electrolyte decomposition. Finally, the rational design and innovative directions of porous materials are provided for their development and application in Li&#8211;O2 battery systems.

      <title>Optical Forces: From Fundamental to Biological Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical forces form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation and are of critical importance in various disciplines from fundamental research to practical applications. Advances in optical forces have made significant impacts for biological exploration both in vitro and in vivo, with applications from individual manipulation and analysis to multiple assembly and detection.








Abstract
Optical forces, generally arising from changes of field gradients or linear momentum carried by photons, form the basis for optical trapping and manipulation. Advances in optical forces help to reveal the nature of light&#8211;matter interactions, giving answers to a wide range of questions and solving problems across various disciplines, and are still yielding new insights in many exciting sciences, particularly in the fields of biological technology, material applications, and quantum sciences. This review focuses on recent advances in optical forces, ranging from fundamentals to applications for biological exploration. First, the basics of different types of optical forces with new light&#8211;matter interaction mechanisms and near&#8208;field techniques for optical force generation beyond the diffraction limit with nanometer accuracy are described. Optical forces for biological applications from in vitro to in vivo are then reviewed. Applications from individual manipulation to multiple assembly into functional biophotonic probes and soft&#8208;matter superstructures are discussed. At the end future directions for application of optical forces for biological exploration are provided.

      <title>In Search of Chiral Molecular Superconductors: &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 Revisited</title>

The enantiopure mixed valence radical cations salts &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 and &#954;&#8208;[(R,R)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4, prepared by electrocrystallization of the chiral donor DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF, show metallic conductivity but no superconducting transition, unlike the conclusions of an earlier report. Original structural and electronic features consisting in two different &#954;&#8208;type layers having 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality are revealed by structural investigations and band structure calculations.








Abstract
The relationship between chirality and superconductivity is an intriguing question. The two enantiomeric crystalline radical cation salts &#954;&#8208;[(S,S)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4 and &#954;&#8208;[(R,R)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]2ClO4, showing &#954;&#8208;type arrangement of the organic layers, are investigated in search for superconducting chiral molecular materials following a 1992 report indicating the occurrence of a superconducting transition in the former compound. While the initial interpretation is presently challenged through in&#8208;depth temperature and pressure dependent single crystal resistivity measurements combined with band structure calculations, the two chiral conductors show metal like behavior with room temperature conductivities of 10&#8211;30 S cm&#8722;1 at ambient pressure and stabilization of the metallic state down to the lowest temperatures under moderate pressures. Moreover, their structural and theoretical investigations reveal an original feature, namely the existence of two different &#954; layers with 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality, respectively, as a consequence of an interlayer charge transfer. The resistivity drop observed for one sample below 1 K and insensitive to magnetic field, possibly results from mixing in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane contributions to the measured resistance and suggests current induced charge order melting. This feature contradicts the occurrence of superconductivity in these chiral molecular conductors and leaves open the discovery of the first chiral molecular superconductors.

&lt;p&gt;The enantiopure mixed valence radical cations salts &#954;&#8208;[(&lt;i&gt;S,S &lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &#954;&#8208;[(&lt;i&gt;R,R &lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, prepared by electrocrystallization of the chiral donor DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF, show metallic conductivity but no superconducting transition, unlike the conclusions of an earlier report. Original structural and electronic features consisting in two different &#954;&#8208;type layers having 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality are revealed by structural investigations and band structure calculations.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between chirality and superconductivity is an intriguing question. The two enantiomeric crystalline radical cation salts &#954;&#8208;[(&lt;i&gt;S,S &lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &#954;&#8208;[(&lt;i&gt;R,R &lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;DM&#8208;BEDT&#8208;TTF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, showing &#954;&#8208;type arrangement of the organic layers, are investigated in search for superconducting chiral molecular materials following a 1992 report indicating the occurrence of a superconducting transition in the former compound. While the initial interpretation is presently challenged through in&#8208;depth temperature and pressure dependent single crystal resistivity measurements combined with band structure calculations, the two chiral conductors show metal like behavior with room temperature conductivities of 10&#8211;30 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at ambient pressure and stabilization of the metallic state down to the lowest temperatures under moderate pressures. Moreover, their structural and theoretical investigations reveal an original feature, namely the existence of two different &#954; layers with 1D and 2D electronic dimensionality, respectively, as a consequence of an interlayer charge transfer. The resistivity drop observed for one sample below 1 K and insensitive to magnetic field, possibly results from mixing in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane contributions to the measured resistance and suggests current induced charge order melting. This feature contradicts the occurrence of superconductivity in these chiral molecular conductors and leaves open the discovery of the first chiral molecular superconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Novo Design of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes toward Ultrafast Anion Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
The de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) afforded dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the intrinsic channels within the frameworks, rendering one of the highest hydroxide conductivities among the ever&#8208;reported anion exchange membranes (AEMs), and demonstrating the feasibility of COFs as the building blocks for high&#8208;performance AEMs.








Abstract
The emergence of all&#8208;organic frameworks is of fundamental significance, and designing such structures for anion conduction holds great promise in energy conversion and storage applications. Herein, inspired by the efficient anion transport within organisms, a de novo design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) toward ultrafast anion transport is demonstrated. A phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process is developed to acquire dense and ordered alignment of quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized side chains along the channels within the frameworks. The resultant self&#8208;standing COFs membranes exhibit one of the highest hydroxide conductivities (212 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C) among the reported anion exchange membranes. Meanwhile, it is found that shorter, more hydrophilic side chains are favorable for anion conduction. The present work highlights the prospects of all&#8208;organic framework materials as the platform building blocks in designing ion exchange membranes and ion sieving membranes.

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal SnSe Thermoelectric Fibers via Laser&#8208;Induced Directional Crystallization: From 1D Fibers to Multidimensional Fabrics</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal SnSe fibers are achieved using thermal drawing and laser&#8208;induced recrystallization. The resulting single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, enhancing the ZT value close to 2 at 860 K, while being highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach engages the fiber&#8208;shaped high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal tin selenide (SnSe), a record holder of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, enables high&#8208;efficient interconversion between heat and electricity for power generation or refrigeration. However, the rigid bulky SnSe cannot satisfy the applications for flexible and wearable devices. Here, a method is demonstrated to achieve ultralong single&#8208;crystal SnSe wire with rock&#8208;salt structure and high thermoelectric performance with diameters from micro&#8208; to nanoscale. This method starts from thermally drawing SnSe into a flexible fiber&#8208;like substrate, which is polycrystalline, highly flexible, ultralong, and mechanically stable. Then a CO2 laser is employed to recrystallize the SnSe core to single&#8208;crystal over the entire fiber. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the single&#8208;crystal rock&#8208;salt SnSe fibers possess high thermoelectric properties, significantly enhancing the ZT value to 2 at 862 K. This simple and low&#8208;cost approach offers a promising path to engage the fiber&#8208;shaped single&#8208;crystal materials in applications from 1D fiber devices to multidimensional wearable fabrics.

      <title>Fabricating 3D Metastructures by Simultaneous Modulation of Flexible Resist Stencils and Basal Molds</title>
      <dc:description>
Orthotropic control of resist stencils and basal molds is developed to realize high&#8208;resolution true triaxial fabrication of 3D metastructures. New strategies to modulate the basal mold with high precision are realized by a controlled annealing process. A new alignment technique is also introduced to stacking the 3D metastructures with high addressability.








Abstract
Metamaterials have gained much attention thanks to their extraordinary and intriguing optical properties beyond natural materials. However, universal high&#8208;resolution fabrications of 3D micro/nanometastructures with high&#8208;resolution remain a challenge. Here, a novel approach to fabricate sophisticated 3D micro/nanostructures with excellent robustness and precise controllability is demonstrated by simultaneously modulating of flexible resist stencils and basal molds. This method allows arbitrary manipulations of morphology, size, and orientation, as well as contact angles of the objects. Combined with a new alignment strategy of high&#8208;resolution, previously inaccessible architectures are fabricated with ultrahigh precision, leading to an excellent spectra response from the fabricated metastructures. This method provides a new possibility to realize true 3D metamaterial fabrications featuring high&#8208;resolution and direct&#8208;compatibility with broad planar lithography platforms.

      <title>Large&#8208;Area Alignment of Supramolecular Columns by Photothermal Laser Writing</title>
      <dc:description>
Supramolecular columns of nanoscale periodicity (&#8776;4.75 nm) are aligned in a uniform direction over a large area by photothermal laser writing. The alignment direction of the supramolecular structures is determined by varying the laser heating conditions. Area&#8208;selective alignment is also demonstrated by local laser writing, and planar structures of supramolecular materials along the laser scanning direction at the specified areas are generated.








Abstract
Controlling the orientation of highly periodic supramolecular structures of small feature size (&lt;5 nm) is the first step for potential applications in optoelectronics, membranes, and template synthesis. A new method, namely, laser photothermal writing, is introduced to direct the orientation of supramolecular columns over a large area. Supramolecular columns consisting of taper&#8208;shaped molecules with long aliphatic tail groups are aligned by a thermal gradient, which is induced by exposing a near&#8208;infrared laser beam to a graphene photothermal conversion layer. Intriguingly, the orientation of the supramolecular columns can be controlled in a facile manner by varying the laser scanning velocity and power. In contrast to previous methodologies for aligning supramolecular structures, this laser photothermal mechanism allows the directional and continuous alignment of supramolecular structures over an arbitrary large area with the easy control of laser irradiation. Besides, the laser process also enables area&#8208;selective orientation of the supramolecular structures for device&#8208;oriented nanopatterning.

      <title>Toward Robust Macroscale Superlubricity on Engineering Steel Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel principle is proposed to assemble numberless &#8220;microscale superlubricity&#8221; into &#8220;macroscale superlubricity,&#8221; where the elaborately constructed micro&#8208;asperities of rough engineering substrate play the role of splitting macro&#8208;surface into micro&#8208;points. Then at each contact point, special measures, such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in and heterogeneous 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered state, chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby achieving robust macroscale superlubricity.








Abstract
&#8220;Structural superlubricity&#8221; is an important fundamental phenomenon in modern tribology that is expected to greatly diminish friction in mechanical engineering, but now is limited to achieve only at nanoscale and microscale in experiment. A novel principle for broadening the structural superlubricating state based on numberless micro&#8208;contact into macroscale superlubricity is demonstrated. The topography of micro&#8208;asperities on engineering steel substrates is elaborately constructed to divide the macroscale surface contact into microscale point contacts. Then at each contact point, special measures such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in period and coating heterogeneous covalent/ionic or ionic/ionic nanocomposite of 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer state, weak chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby satisfying the prerequisites responsible for structural superlubricity. Finally, the robust superlubricating states on engineering steel&#8211;steel macroscale contact pairs are achieved with significantly reduced friction coefficient in 10&#8722;3 magnitude, extra&#8208;long antiwear life (more than 1.0 &#215; 106 laps), and good universality to wide range of materials and loads, which can be of significance for the industrialization of &#8220;structural superlubricity.&#8221;

The topography of micro&#8208;asperities on engineering steel substrates is elaborately constructed to divide the macroscale surface contact into microscale point contacts. Then at each contact point, special measures such as pre&#8208;running&#8208;in period and coating heterogeneous covalent/ionic or ionic/ionic nanocomposite of 2D materials are devised to manipulate the interfacial ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer state, weak chemical interaction, and incommensurate configuration, thereby satisfying the prerequisites responsible for structural superlubricity. Finally, the robust superlubricating states on engineering steel&#8211;steel macroscale contact pairs are achieved with significantly reduced friction coefficient in 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; magnitude, extra&#8208;long antiwear life (more than 1.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; laps), and good universality to wide range of materials and loads, which can be of significance for the industrialization of &#8220;structural superlubricity.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Co2P Nanoparticle/Multi&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance trifunctional electrocatalyst which is characterized by Co2P nanoparticles embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon is developed using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effect of Co2P on multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates provides an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing efficient and low&#8208;cost replacements for precious metals as electrocatalysts active in electrochemical reactions&#8212;the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8212;is a top priority in renewable energy technology. In this work a highly active and very stable trifunctional electrocatalyst composed of Co2P embedded in Co, N, and P multi&#8208;doped carbon has been synthesized using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effects between Co2P and the multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon substrates afford materials having electrocatalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR, which are comparable&#8212;or even superior to&#8212;those of commercial RuO2 or Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that Co2P has a higher density of states at the Fermi level than ConP (0 &lt; n &lt; 2), which promotes electron transfer and intermediates adsorption in the catalytic process. Zinc&#8211;air batteries and water splitting devices assembled using the materials as electrode electrocatalysts show good performance and outstanding stability. This work represents a breakthrough in improving the catalytic performance of non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and ORR, and opens new avenues for clean energy generation.

Abstract
Engineering novel Sn&#8208;based bimetallic materials could provide intriguing catalytic properties to boost the electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, the first synthesis of homogeneous Sn1&#8722;xBix alloy nanoparticles (x up to 0.20) with native Bi&#8208;doped amorphous SnOx shells for efficient CO2 reduction is reported. The Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells boost the production of formate with high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) over a wide potential window (&#8722;0.67 to &#8722;0.92&#160;V vs RHE) with low overpotentials, outperforming current tin oxide catalysts. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Bi&#8208;SnOx nanoshells derived from Sn0.80Bi0.20 alloy nanoparticles exhibit a great partial current density of 74.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high Faradaic efficiency of 95.8%. The detailed electrocatalytic analyses and corresponding density functional theory calculations simultaneously reveal that the incorporation of Bi atoms into Sn species facilitates formate production by suppressing the formation of H2 and CO.

      <title>Bioinspired Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tumor Parallel Catalytic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an intriguing paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy using bioinspired copper single&#8208;atom catalysts to directly catalyze O2 and H2O2 in parallel into O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH, respectively, for the oxidation and damage of target biomolecules without external energy input, which is expected to deliver a novel therapeutic nanoplatform for clinics in the future.








Abstract
The oxidation of intracellular biomolecules by reactive oxygen species (ROS) forms the basis for ROS&#8208;based tumor therapy. However, the current therapeutic modalities cannot catalyze H2O2 and O2 concurrently for ROS generation, thereby leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, it is reported a bioinspired hollow N&#8208;doped carbon sphere doped with a single&#8208;atom copper species (Cu&#8208;HNCS) that can directly catalyze the decomposition of both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to ROS, namely superoxide ion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) and the hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), respectively, in an acidic tumor microenvironment for the oxidation of intracellular biomolecules without external energy input, thus resulting in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. Notably, the Fenton reaction turnover frequency of Cu species in Cu&#8208;HNCS is &#8776;5000 times higher than that of Fe in commercial Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of Cu&#8208;HNCS originates from the single&#8208;atom copper, and the calculation predicts a next&#8208;generation Fenton catalyst. This work provides an effective paradigm of tumor parallel catalytic therapy for considerably enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

      <title>Multiscale Architecture and Superior High&#8208;Temperature Performance of Discontinuously Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs) by tailoring multiscale architectures have exposed more promising mechanical properties, including comparatively better strengthening effects, exceptional high&#8208;temperature endurability, and most importantly, decent tensile ductility. The most recent developments, including the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for composites, are reviewed.








Abstract
Discontinuously reinforced titanium matrix composites (DRTMCs), as one of the most important metal matrix composites (MMCs), are expected to exhibit high strength, elastic modulus, high&#8208;temperature endurability, wear resistance, isotropic property, and formability. Recent innovative research shows that tailoring the reinforcement network distribution totally differently from the conventional homogeneous distribution can not only improve the strengthening effect but also resolve the dilemma of DRTMCs with poor tensile ductility. Based on the network architecture, multiscale architecture, for example, two&#8208;scale network and laminate&#8208;network microstructure can further inspire superior strength, creep, and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Herein, the most recent developments, which include the design, fabrication, microstructure, high&#8208;temperature performance, strengthening mechanisms, and future research opportunities for DRTMCs with multiscale architecture, are captured. In this regard, the service temperature can be increased by 200 &#176;C, and the creep rupture time by 59&#8208;fold compared with those of conventional titanium alloys, which can meet the urgent demands of lightweight nickel&#8208;based structural materials and potentially replace nickel base superalloys at 600&#8211;800 &#176;C to reduce weight by 45%. In fact, multiscale architecture design strategy will also favorably open a new era in the research of extensive metallic materials for improved performances.

      <title>Giant and Broadband Multiphoton Absorption Nonlinearities of a 2D Organometallic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
      <dc:description>
Giant and broadband multiphoton absorption effects are presented in 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, which exhibits a record&#8208;high five&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4, exceeding all the known ferroelectrics and being about 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules. This makes a breakthrough in ferroelectrics for newly conceptual photonic device applications.








Abstract
Multiphoton absorption (MPA) has been utilized for important technological applications. High&#8208;order multiphoton harvesting (e.g., five&#8208;photon absorption, 5PA) exhibits unique properties that could benefit biophotonics. Within this field, perovskite oxide ferroelectrics (e.g., BaTiO3) enable low&#8208;order optical nonlinearities of 2PA/3PA processes. However, it is challenging to obtain efficient, high&#8208;order 5PA effects. Herein, for the first time, giant and broadband MPA properties are presented in the 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (IA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (1; IA = isoamylammonium and MA = methylammonium), where multiphoton&#8208;excited optical nonlinearities related to different MPA mechanisms over a broadband range of 550&#8211;2400 nm are observed. Strikingly, its 5PA absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;5) reaches up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;132 cm10 s4 photon&#8722;4 (at 2400 nm), almost 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules and a record&#8208;high value among all known ferroelectrics. This unprecedented 5PA effect results from the quantum&#8208;confined motif of inorganic trilayer sheets (wells) and organic cations (barriers) in 1. Moreover, its large ferroelectric polarization of 5 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 could promote modulation of MPA effects under external electric fields. As far as it is known, this is the first report on giant, broadband high&#8208;order MPA properties in ferroelectrics, which provides potential, novel electric&#8208;ordered materials for next&#8208;generation biophotonic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Giant and broadband multiphoton absorption effects are presented in 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, which exhibits a record&#8208;high five&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of 1.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;132&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; photon&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding all the known ferroelectrics and being about 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules. This makes a breakthrough in ferroelectrics for newly conceptual photonic device applications.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiphoton absorption (MPA) has been utilized for important technological applications. High&#8208;order multiphoton harvesting (e.g., five&#8208;photon absorption, 5PA) exhibits unique properties that could benefit biophotonics. Within this field, perovskite oxide ferroelectrics (e.g., BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) enable low&#8208;order optical nonlinearities of 2PA/3PA processes. However, it is challenging to obtain efficient, high&#8208;order 5PA effects. Herein, for the first time, giant and broadband MPA properties are presented in the 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (IA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1 &lt;/b&gt;; IA = isoamylammonium and MA = methylammonium), where multiphoton&#8208;excited optical nonlinearities related to different MPA mechanisms over a broadband range of 550&#8211;2400 nm are observed. Strikingly, its 5PA absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) reaches up to 1.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;132&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; photon&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; (at 2400 nm), almost 10 orders larger than some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecules and a record&#8208;high value among all known ferroelectrics. This unprecedented 5PA effect results from the quantum&#8208;confined motif of inorganic trilayer sheets (wells) and organic cations (barriers) in &lt;b&gt;1 &lt;/b&gt;. Moreover, its large ferroelectric polarization of 5 &#181;C cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; could promote modulation of MPA effects under external electric fields.

      <title>Interface Issues and Challenges in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Lithium, Sodium, and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics between solid electrolytes and electrodes are considered as a crucial factor in determining all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery performance. The interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries, are discussed.

Abstract
Owing to the promise of high safety and energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are attracting incremental interest as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread applications are inhibited by many technical challenges, including low&#8208;conductivity electrolytes, dendrite growth, and poor cycle/rate properties. Particularly, the interfacial dynamics between the solid electrolyte and the electrode is considered as a crucial factor in determining solid&#8208;state battery performance. In recent years, intensive research efforts have been devoted to understanding the interfacial behavior and strategies to overcome these challenges for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Here, the interfacial principle and engineering in a variety of solid&#8208;state batteries, including solid&#8208;state lithium/sodium batteries and emerging batteries (lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;air, etc.), are discussed. Specific attention is paid to interface physics (contact and wettability) and interface chemistry (passivation layer, ionic transport, dendrite growth), as well as the strategies to address the above concerns. The purpose here is to outline the current interface issues and challenges, allowing for target&#8208;oriented research for solid&#8208;state electrochemical energy storage. Current trends and future perspectives in interfacial engineering are also presented.

      <title>Tough and Multi&#8208;Recyclable Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Polyureas via Incorporating Noncovalent Bonds into Main&#8208;Chains</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU). After five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties. Overall, CSPU exhibit the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability.








Abstract
Covalent thermosets generally exhibit robust mechanical properties, while they are fragile and lack the ability to be reprocessed or recycled. Herein, a new strategy of incorporating noncovalent bonds into main&#8208;chains is developed to construct tough and multi&#8208;recyclable cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polyureas (CSPU), which are prepared via the copolymerization of diisocyanate monomers, noncovalently bonded diamine monomers linked by quadruple hydrogen bonds, and covalent diamine/triamine monomers. The CSPU exhibit remarkable solvent resistance and outstanding mechanical properties owing to the covalent cross&#8208;linking via triamine monomer. Through the incorporation of 9.7% and 14.6% quadruple hydrogen bonded diamine monomer, the transparent CSPU films are endowed with superior toughness of 74.17 and 124.17 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively. Impressively, even after five generations of recycling processes, the mechanical properties of reprocessed CSPU can recover more than 95% of their original properties, displaying excellent multiple recyclablity. As a result, the superior toughness, remarkable solvent resistance, high transparency, and excellent multiple recyclability are well&#8208;combined in the CSPU. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile and general method to construct various cross&#8208;linked polymer materials with superior recyclability and mechanical properties.

      <title>Light Management with Natural Materials: From Whiteness to Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>
A wide range of strategies is used to manage light propagation in plants and animals to produce transparent and white appearances. Inspired by nature, various transparent (low&#8208;scattering) and opaque (high&#8208;scattering) cellulose&#8208;based materials have been developed.

Abstract
The possibility of structuring material at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interactions and therefore fabricate next&#8208;generation paints and coatings. In this context, nature can serve not only as a source of inspiration for the design of such novel optical structures, but also as a primary source of materials. Here, some of the strategies used in nature to optimize light&#8211;matter interaction are reviewed and some of the recent progress in the production of optical materials made solely of plant&#8208;derived building blocks is highlighted. In nature, nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized structured materials made from biopolymers are at the origin of most of the light&#8208;transport effects. How natural photonic systems manage light scattering and what can be learned from plants and animals to produce photonic materials from biopolymers are discussed. Tuning the light&#8208;scattering properties via structural variations allows a wide range of appearances to be obtained, from whiteness to transparency, using the same renewable and biodegradable building blocks. Here, various transparent and white cellulose&#8208;based materials produced so far are highlighted.

      <title>Multimode Hydraulically Amplified Electrostatic Actuators for Wearable Haptics</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified zipping taxels (HAXELs) are thin, soft fluidically coupled electrostatic actuators, generating both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane motion, delivering rich haptic sensations by locally applying normal and shear forces to the skin. A 90 mg actuator generates 300 mN of force and 500 &#181;m displacement in under 5 ms. Arrays of wearable HAXELs provide a realistic sense of touch.








Abstract
The sense of touch is underused in today&#8217;s virtual reality systems due to lack of wearable, soft, mm&#8208;scale transducers to generate dynamic mechanical stimulus on the skin. Extremely thin actuators combining both high force and large displacement are a long&#8208;standing challenge in soft actuators. Sub&#8208;mm thick flexible hydraulically amplified electrostatic actuators are reported here, capable of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane motion, providing normal and shear forces to the user&#8217;s fingertip, hand, or arm. Each actuator consists of a fluid&#8208;filled cavity whose shell is made of a metalized polyester boundary and a central elastomer region. When a voltage is applied to the annular electrodes, the fluid is rapidly forced into the stretchable region, forming a raised bump. A 6 mm &#215; 6 mm &#215; 0.8 mm actuator weighs 90 mg, and generates forces of over 300 mN, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane displacements of 500 &#181;m (over 60% strain), and lateral motion of 760 &#181;m. Response time is below 5 ms, for a specific power of 100 W kg&#8722;1. In user tests, human subjects distinguished normal and different 2&#8208;axis shear forces with over 80% accuracy. A flexible 5 &#215; 5 array is demonstrated, integrated in a haptic sleeve.

      <title>3D Printing of Microgel&#8208;Loaded Modular Microcages as Instructive Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel 3D printed microcages that can be easily assembled via simple stacking to fit the complexity of various tissue defects are introduced. Individual microcage units allow for spatial loading of biomolecules to instruct site&#8208;specific cell migration three&#8208;dimensionally and facilitate neovascularization in vivo, thus accelerating the process of healing.








Abstract
Biomaterial scaffolds have served as the foundation of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, scaffold systems are often difficult to scale in size or shape in order to fit defect&#8208;specific dimensions, and thus provide only limited spatiotemporal control of therapeutic delivery and host tissue responses. Here, a lithography&#8208;based 3D printing strategy is used to fabricate a novel miniaturized modular microcage scaffold system, which can be assembled and scaled manually with ease. Scalability is based on an intuitive concept of stacking modules, like conventional toy interlocking plastic blocks, allowing for literally thousands of potential geometric configurations, and without the need for specialized equipment. Moreover, the modular hollow&#8208;microcage design allows each unit to be loaded with biologic cargo of different compositions, thus enabling controllable and easy patterning of therapeutics within the material in 3D. In summary, the concept of miniaturized microcage designs with such straight&#8208;forward assembly and scalability, as well as controllable loading properties, is a flexible platform that can be extended to a wide range of materials for improved biological performance.

      <title>Antineoplastic Drug&#8208;Free Anticancer Strategy Enabled by Host&#8208;Defense&#8208;Peptides&#8208;Mimicking Synthetic Polypeptides</title>
      <dc:description>
An antineoplastic drug&#8208;free anticancer strategy enabled by host defense peptides (HDPs)&#8208;mimicking synthetic polypeptides is proposed. The synthetic anticancer polypeptides (ACPP) exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer activity through an HDPs&#8208;like membrane&#8208;lytic mechanism. Modification of ACPP with 2,3&#8208;dimethylmaleic anhydride (DA) generates a pH&#8208;sensitive zwitterionic derivative, DA&#8208;ACPP, with improved biocompatibility, which can selectively lyse tumors in vivo after being activated in acidic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
An antineoplastic drug&#8208;free anticancer strategy enabled by host defense peptides (HDPs)&#8208;mimicking synthetic polypeptides is reported. The polypeptide exhibits a broad spectrum of anticancer activity in 12 cancer cell lines, including drug&#8208;resistant and highly metastatic tumor cells. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the cationic anticancer polypeptide (ACPP) can directly induce rapid necrosis of cancer cells within minutes through a membrane&#8208;lytic mechanism. Moreover, a pH&#8208;sensitive zwitterionic derivative of ACPP (DA&#8208;ACPP) is prepared for in vivo application. DA&#8208;ACPP shows negligible hemolysis under neutral physiological conditions, and can be converted back to ACPP in slightly acidic tumor environments, resulting in selective killing of cancer cells. Consequently, DA&#8208;ACPP shows an effective inhibition of tumor growth in both 4T1 orthotopic breast tumor models and B16&#8208;F10 melanoma pulmonary metastatic models. Overall, these findings demonstrate that synthetic HDPs&#8208;mimicking polypeptides represent safe and effective antineoplastic agents, which sheds new light on the development of drug&#8208;free synthetic polymers for cancer therapy.

      <title>2D Materials Decorated with Ultra&#8208;Thin and Porous Graphene Oxide for High Stability and Selective Surface Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Janus&#8208;like&#8221; 2D porous heterostructures are described for realizing ultra&#8208;stable surface reactivity of chemiresistive 2D materials as proven by chemical sensing case study and multiscale simulations. The few&#8208;layered holey graphene oxide passivation layer effectively shields black phosphorous and MXene from oxidative degradation, while allowing the selective diffusion of NO2 molecules toward the underlying 2D sensing materials.








Abstract
2D black phosphorous (BP) and MXenes have triggered enormous research interest in catalysis, energy storage, and chemical sensing. Unfortunately, the low stability of these materials under practical operating conditions remains a critical bottleneck, particularly as they are prone to oxidization under moisture. In this work, the design and application of stable 2D heterostructures obtained from decorating BP and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with few&#8208;layer holey graphene oxide (FHGO) membranes are presented. In the resulting heterostructured systems, FHGO serves as a multifunctional passivation layer that shields BP or MXene from oxidative degradation, while allowing the selective diffusion of target gas molecules through its micropores and toward the underlying 2D material. Through a case study of dilute NO2 sensing, it is demonstrated that these heterostructures show a greatly enhanced sensing performance under humid conditions, where fast sensing speed and response are consistently observed, and high stability is impressively retained upon repetitive sensing cycles for 1000 min. These results corroborate the efficacy of material decoration with porous FHGO membranes and suggest that this is a generalizable strategy for reliable high&#8208;performance applications of 2D materials.

      <title>An Atomically Thin Optoelectronic Machine Vision Processor</title>
      <dc:description>
2D materials have been extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications.

This vision processor mimics two core functions of human vision: image sensing like the eyes and recognition like the brain, demonstrating visual recognition of 1000 handwritten numbers.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, especially transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, are extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Beyond intensive studies on single transistors and photodetectors, the recent advent of large&#8208;area synthesis of these atomically thin layers has paved the way for 2D integrated circuits, such as digital logic circuits and image sensors, achieving an integration level of &#8776;100 devices thus far. Here, a decisive advance in 2D integrated circuits is reported, where the device integration scale is increased by tenfold and the functional complexity of 2D electronics is propelled to an unprecedented level. Concretely, an analog optoelectronic processor inspired by biological vision is developed, where 32 &#215; 32 = 1024 MoS2 photosensitive field&#8208;effect transistors manifesting persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effects are arranged in a crossbar array. This optoelectronic processor with PPC memory mimics two core functions of human vision: it captures and stores an optical image into electrical data, like the eye and optic nerve chain, and then recognizes this electrical form of the captured image, like the brain, by executing analog in&#8208;memory neural net computing. In the highlight demonstration, the MoS2 FET crossbar array optically images 1000 handwritten digits and electrically recognizes these imaged data with 94% accuracy.

      <title>Coherent Perfect Diffraction in Metagratings</title>
      <dc:description>
Coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations is shown to provide new opportunities for highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with unitary diffraction efficiency.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are 2D engineered structures with subwavelength granularity, offering a wide range of opportunities to tailor the impinging wavefront. However, fundamental limitations on their efficiency in wave transformation, associated with their deeply subwavelength thickness, challenge their implementation in practical application scenarios. Here, it is shown how the coherent control of metagratings through multiple wave excitations can provide new opportunities to achieve highly reconfigurable broadband metasurfaces with large diffraction efficiency, beyond the limitations of conventional approaches. Remarkably, energy distribution between the 0th and higher diffraction orders can be continuously tuned by changing the relative phase difference between two excitation waves, enabling coherent control, with added benefits of enhanced efficiency and bandwidth. This concept is demonstrated for a thin electric metagrating operating at terahertz frequencies, showing that coherent control can overcome several of the limitations of single&#8208;layer ultrathin metastructures, and extend their feasibility in various practical scenarios.

      <title>A Thermal Radiation Modulation Platform by Emissivity Engineering with Graded Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition</title>
      <dc:description>
Unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation is achieved by an unusual material platform based on thin films of vanadium dioxide where tungsten is judiciously graded doped across a thickness of &lt;100 nm. The platform enables various infrared applications including a flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantages, as well as a novel technology named &#8220;infrared decoy.&#8221;








Abstract
Thermal radiation from a black body increases with the fourth power of absolute temperature (T4), an effect known as the Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann law. Typical materials radiate heat at a portion of this limit, where the portion, called integrated emissivity (&#949;int), is insensitive to temperature (|d&#949;int/dT| &#8776; 10&#8722;4 &#176;C&#8211;1). The resultant radiance bound by the T4 law limits the ability to regulate radiative heat. Here, an unusual material platform is shown in which &#949;int can be engineered to decrease in an arbitrary manner near room temperature (|d&#949;int/dT| &#8776; 8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 &#176;C&#8211;1), enabling unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation. As an example, &#949;int is programmed to vary with temperature as the inverse of T4, precisely counteracting the T4 dependence; hence, thermal radiance from the surface becomes temperature&#8208;independent, allowing the fabrication of flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantage in performance stability. The structure is based on thin films of tungsten&#8208;doped vanadium dioxide where the tungsten fraction is judiciously graded across a thickness less than the skin depth of electromagnetic screening.

     alt="A Thermal Radiation Modulation Platform by Emissivity Engineering with Graded Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation is achieved by an unusual material platform based on thin films of vanadium dioxide where tungsten is judiciously graded doped across a thickness of &amp;lt;100 nm. The platform enables various infrared applications including a flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantages, as well as a novel technology named &#8220;infrared decoy.&#8221;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermal radiation from a black body increases with the fourth power of absolute temperature (&lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), an effect known as the Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann law. Typical materials radiate heat at a portion of this limit, where the portion, called integrated emissivity (&#949;&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;), is insensitive to temperature (|d&#949;&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;| &#8776; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The resultant radiance bound by the &lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; law limits the ability to regulate radiative heat. Here, an unusual material platform is shown in which &#949;&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; can be engineered to decrease in an arbitrary manner near room temperature (|d&#949;&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;| &#8776; 8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;), enabling unprecedented manipulation of infrared radiation. As an example, &#949;&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; is programmed to vary with temperature as the inverse of &lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, precisely counteracting the &lt;i&gt;T &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; dependence; hence, thermal radiance from the surface becomes temperature&#8208;independent, allowing the fabrication of flexible and power&#8208;free infrared camouflage with unique advantage in performance stability. The structure is based on thin films of tungsten&#8208;doped vanadium dioxide where the tungsten fraction is judiciously graded across a thickness less than the skin depth of electromagnetic screening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Nonvolatile Organic Photonic Transistor Memory Devices using Conjugated Rod&#8211;Coil Materials as a Floating Gate</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance photonic transistor memory devices are fabricated using conjugated rod&#8211;coil materials as a photoactive floating gate, in which the conjugated rods and side&#8208;chain coils act as charge&#8208;trapping and tunneling moieties, respectively. By inheriting their self&#8208;assembled structure, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type memory devices exhibit a fast response, a current contrast over 105, and an extremely low programing driving force of 0.1 V.








Abstract
A novel approach for using conjugated rod&#8211;coil materials as a floating gate in the fabrication of nonvolatile photonic transistor memory devices, consisting of n&#8208;type Sol&#8208;PDI and p&#8208;type C10&#8208;DNTT, is presented. Sol&#8208;PDI and C10&#8208;DNTT are used as dual functions of charge&#8208;trapping (conjugated rod) and tunneling (insulating coil), while n&#8208;type BPE&#8208;PDI and p&#8208;type DNTT are employed as the corresponding transporting layers. By using the same conjugated rod in the memory layer and transporting channel with a self&#8208;assembled structure, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type memory devices exhibit a fast response, a high current contrast between &#8220;Photo&#8208;On&#8221; and &#8220;Electrical&#8208;Off&#8221; bistable states over 105, and an extremely low programing driving force of 0.1 V. The fabricated photon&#8208;driven memory devices exhibit a quick response to different wavelengths of light and a broadband light response that highlight their promising potential for light&#8208;recorder and synaptic device applications.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Interconnections of Nanoparticles in Cellulosic Fibrous Materials toward 3D Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
To create 3D fibrous sensors, surface&#8208;mediated interconnection of bimodally distributed gold&#8211;copper alloy nanoclusters and nanoparticles (NPs) is exploited as an effective pathway to fabricate embedded microelectrodes in the cellulosic fibrous materials. This pathway is further coupled to surface&#8208;mediated assembly of the NPs to produce chemically sensitive interfaces to targeted gases/vaporous analytes.








Abstract
Fibrous materials serve as an intriguing class of 3D materials to meet the growing demands for flexible, foldable, biocompatible, biodegradable, disposable, inexpensive, and wearable sensors and the rising desires for higher sensitivity, greater miniaturization, lower cost, and better wearability. The use of such materials for the creation of a fibrous sensor substrate that interfaces with a sensing film in 3D with the transducing electronics is however difficult by conventional photolithographic methods. Here, a highly effective pathway featuring surface&#8208;mediated interconnection (SMI) of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and nanoparticles (NPs) in fibrous materials at ambient conditions is demonstrated for fabricating fibrous sensor substrates or platforms. Bimodally distributed gold&#8211;copper alloy NCs and NPs are used as a model system to demonstrate the semiconductive&#8208;to&#8208;metallic conductivity transition, quantized capacitive charging, and anisotropic conductivity characteristics. Upon coupling SMI of NCs/NPs as electrically conductive microelectrodes and surface&#8208;mediated assembly (SMA) of the NCs/NPs as chemically sensitive interfaces, the resulting fibrous chemiresistors function as sensitive and selective sensors for gaseous and vaporous analytes. This new SMI&#8211;SMA strategy has significant implications for manufacturing high&#8208;performance fibrous platforms to meet the growing demands of the advanced multifunctional sensors and biosensors.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range Ordered Amorphous Atomic Chains as Building Blocks of a Superconducting Quasi&#8208;One&#8208;Dimensional Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Combination of long&#8208;range ordered and short&#8208;range disordered structures at the atomic level is demonstrated for a quasi&#8208;1D linear chain compound. Under compression, the constituent atomic chains of the material are amorphized without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. This lattice of amorphous atomic chains hosts a quantum condensate of Cooper pairs.








Abstract
Crystalline and amorphous structures are two of the most common solid&#8208;state phases. Crystals having orientational and periodic translation symmetries are usually both short&#8208;range and long&#8208;range ordered, while amorphous materials have no long&#8208;range order. Short&#8208;range ordered but long&#8208;range disordered materials are generally categorized into amorphous phases. In contrast to the extensively studied crystalline and amorphous phases, the combination of short&#8208;range disordered and long&#8208;range ordered structures at the atomic level is extremely rare and so far has only been reported for solvated fullerenes under compression.&#160;Here, a report on the creation and investigation of a superconducting quasi&#8208;1D material with long&#8208;range ordered amorphous building blocks is presented. Using a diamond anvil cell, monocrystalline (TaSe4)2I is compressed and a system is created where the TaSe4 atomic chains are in amorphous state without breaking the orientational and periodic translation symmetries of the chain lattice. Strikingly, along with the amorphization of the atomic chains, the insulating (TaSe4)2I becomes a superconductor. The data provide critical insight into a new phase of solid&#8208;state materials. The findings demonstrate a first ever case where superconductivity is hosted by a lattice with periodic but amorphous constituent atomic chains.

      <title>Applications of Zeolites to C1 Chemistry: Recent Advances, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Zeolite catalysts play a pivotal role in C1 chemistry including conversion of CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH into various hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, lower olefins, aromatics, and liquid fuels) and oxygenates (e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, and higher alcohols) to meet the demand for energy and chemicals as crude oil reserves decline.








Abstract
C1 chemistry, which is the catalytic transformation of C1 molecules including CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH, plays an important role in providing energy and chemical supplies while meeting environmental requirements. Zeolites are highly efficient solid catalysts used in the chemical industry. The design and development of zeolite&#8208;based mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and multifunctional catalysts has led to a booming application of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts to C1 chemistry. Combining the advantages of zeolites and metallic catalytic species has promoted the catalytic production of various hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, light olefins, aromatics, and liquid fuels) and oxygenates (e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, and higher alcohols) from C1 molecules. The key zeolite descriptors that influence catalytic performance, such as framework topologies, nanoconfinement effects, Br&#248;nsted acidities, secondary&#8208;pore systems, particle sizes, extraframework cations and atoms, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and proximity between acid and metallic sites are discussed to provide a deep understanding of the significance of zeolites to C1 chemistry. An outlook regarding challenges and opportunities for the conversion of C1 resources using zeolite&#8208;based catalysts to meet emerging energy and environmental demands is also presented.

      <title>Record Enhancement of Phase Transition Temperature Realized by H/F Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
From (1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3, a molecular design strategy of H/F substitution is applied to synthesize a multiaxial organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3. The phase transition temperature is successfully increased from 190 to 419&#160;K, which is a record enhancement of 229&#160;K for molecular ferroelectrics, significantly outperforming those induced by the isotope effect and other techniques.








Abstract
A high transition temperature (Tc) is essential for the practical application of ferroelectrics as electronic devices under extreme thermal conditions in the aerospace, automotive, and energy industries. In recent decades, the isotope effect and strain engineering are found to effectively modulate Tc; however, these strategies are limited to certain systems. Developing simple, universal, and practical methods to improve Tc has become an imminent challenge for expanding the applications of ferroelectrics. Here, by adopting a molecular design strategy involving H/F substitution on an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3 at a Tc of 190&#160;K, the successful synthesis of a multiaxial, ferroelectric hybrid perovskite (4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl3 is reported, which demonstrates a large spontaneous polarization of 11.2&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2 (greater than that of polyvinylidene difluoride) and a Tc of 419&#160;K (greater than that of BaTiO3). This temperature enhancement (229&#160;K) is the largest reported for molecular ferroelectrics, far exceeding the reported enhancements induced by the isotope effect and other techniques. This pioneering technique provides an effective and universal method for improving Tc in ferroelectrics and represents an important step toward the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric technology.

&lt;p&gt;From (1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a molecular design strategy of H/F substitution is applied to synthesize a multiaxial organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)CdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The phase transition temperature is successfully increased from 190 to 419&#160;K, which is a record enhancement of 229&#160;K for molecular ferroelectrics, significantly outperforming those induced by the isotope effect and other techniques.

      <title>Comprehensive Electrical Control of Metamagnetic Transition of a Quasi&#8208;2D Antiferromagnet by In Situ Anisotropic Strain</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective nonmagnetic control of the spin structure is at the forefront of the study for functional quantum materials. This study demonstrates that an in situ anisotropic strain of less than 0.1% is able to fully tune the metamagnetic transition of Sr2IrO4 by almost 300%, which enables electrically controllable and electronically detectable metamagnetic switching in this excellent prototype of antiferromagnetic spintronic.








Abstract
Effective nonmagnetic control of the spin structure is at the forefront of the study for functional quantum materials. This study demonstrates that, by applying an anisotropic strain up to only 0.05%, the metamagnetic transition field of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 can be in situ modulated by almost 300%. Simultaneous measurements of resonant X&#8208;ray scattering and transport reveal that this drastic response originates from the complete strain&#8208;tuning of the transition between the spin&#8208;flop and spin&#8208;flip limits, and is always accompanied by large elastoconductance and magnetoconductance. This enables electrically controllable and electronically detectable metamagnetic switching, despite the antiferromagnetic insulating state. The obtained strain&#8208;magnetic field phase diagram reveals that C4&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking anisotropy is introduced by strain via pseudospin&#8208;lattice coupling, directly demonstrating the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled complex oxides. The extracted coupling strength is much weaker than the superexchange interactions, yet crucial for the spontaneous symmetry&#8208;breaking, affording the remarkably efficient strain&#8208;control.

      <title>Unraveling the Crystallization Kinetics of 2D Perovskites with Sandwich&#8208;Type Structure for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
An in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering experiment is conducted to reveal the crystallization kinetics and formation mechanism of 2D perovskite films, during which additives play a key role in regulating the nucleation and growth process. For the dual additive processing case, a novel sandwich&#8208;type structure is achieved, which can effectively passivate defects at dual interfaces, finally resulting in a high device efficiency of 16.48%.








Abstract
2D perovskite solar cells with high stability and high efficiency have attracted significant attention. A systematical static and dynamic structure investigation is carried out to show the details of 2D morphology evolution. A dual additive approach is used, where the synergy between an alkali metal cation and a polar solvent leads to high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with sandwich&#8208;type structures and vertical phase segregation. Such novel structure can induce high&#8208;quality 2D slab growth and reduce internal and surface defects, resulting in a high device efficiency of 16.48% with enhanced continuous illumination stability and improved moisture (55&#8211;60%) and thermal (85&#160;&#176;C) tolerances. Transient absorption spectra reveal the carrier migration from low n to high n species with different kinetics. An [PbI6]4&#8722; octagon coalescence transformation mechanism coupled with metal and organic cations wrapped is proposed. By solvent vapor annealing, a recrystallization and reorientation of the 2D perovskite slabs occurs to form an ideal structure with improved device performance and stability.

      <title>An Acoustic Meta&#8208;Skin Insulator</title>
      <dc:description>
Underwater acoustic wave confinement in an all&#8208;angle and wide spectrum range can be realized in a meta&#8208;skin insulator due to the tremendous impedance mismatch originating from the stable Cassie&#8211;Baxter state. Acoustic&#8208;wave&#8208;based underwater orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing and binary coding are implemented, which is promising for long&#8208;haul and anti&#8208;interference communication.

Abstract
Acoustic metamaterials with artificial microstructures are attractive to realize intriguing functions, including efficient waveguiding, which requires large impedance mismatches to realize total side reflection with negligible transmission and absorption. While large impedance mismatch can be readily realized in an air environment, acoustic waveguiding in an underwater environment remains elusive due to insufficient impedance mismatch of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metamaterials. Here, a superhydrophobic acoustic metasurface of microstructured poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane, referred to as a &#8220;meta&#8208;skin&#8221; insulator, which is able to confine acoustic waves in an all&#8208;angle and wide spectrum range due to tremendous impedance mismatch at stable air/water interfaces, viz., the Cassie&#8211;Baxter state is demonstrated. By utilizing the meta&#8208;skin insulator with broadband and high throughput, orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum multiplexing at a high spectral efficiency and binary coding along large&#8208;angle bending channels for bit&#8208;error&#8208;free acoustic data transmission in an underwater environment are demonstrated. Very different from optical and/or electrical cable communications, acoustic waves can be simply and effectively coupled into remote meta&#8208;skin acoustic fibers from free space, which is technologically significant for long&#8208;haul and anti&#8208;interference communication. This work can enlighten many fluidic applications based on efficient waveguiding, such as in vivo ultrasound medical treatment and imaging.

      <title>Simultaneous Piezoelectrocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution and Degradation of Water Pollutants by Quartz Microrods@Few&#8208;Layered MoS2 Hierarchical Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectrocatalysis system is developed, which involves quartz microrods abundantly decorated with active&#8208;edge&#8208;site MoS2 nanosheets to form a quartz microrods@few&#8208;layered MoS2 hierarchical heterostructure (QMSH).

An efficient piezoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and decomposition of wastewater can be achieved simultaneously without light irradiation.








Abstract
Intense light attenuation in water/wastewater results in photocatalysts exhibiting a low quantum efficiency. This study develops a novel piezoelectrocatalysis system, which involves quartz microrods (MRs) abundantly decorated with active&#8208;edge&#8208;site MoS2 nanosheets to form a quartz microrods@few&#8208;layered MoS2 hierarchical heterostructure (QMSH). Through theoretical calculations, it is found that the quartz MRs serve as a parallel&#8208;plate capacitor, which is self&#8208;powered to provide an internal electric field to the few&#8208;layered MoS2 nanosheets surrounding the quartz MR surfaces, and the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) effectively facilitates redox reactions with the free carriers in MoS2. The self&#8208;powered quartz MRs in the QMSH present an internal bias to the MoS2 nanosheets, thus yielding a piezoelectrocatalysis system. An efficient piezoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and decomposition of wastewater without light irradiation can be achieved simultaneously. The second&#8208;order rate constant of the QMSH is &#8776;0.631 L mg&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, which is 650&#8208;fold that of quartz MRs, indicating that the piezoelectric heterostructural catalysts display exceptionally high efficiency on piezoelectrocatalytic redox reactions rather than in the piezocatalytic process. The H2&#8208;production rate of QMSH catalysts approaches &#8776;6456 &#181;mo1 g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and peaks at &#8776;16.8 mmol g&#8722;1 in 8 h. The piezoelectrocatalytic process may be a promising method for treating industrial wastewater and producing clean energy.

The self&#8208;powered quartz MRs in the QMSH present an internal bias to the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets, thus yielding a piezoelectrocatalysis system. An efficient piezoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and decomposition of wastewater without light irradiation can be achieved simultaneously. The second&#8208;order rate constant of the QMSH is &#8776;0.631 L mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 650&#8208;fold that of quartz MRs, indicating that the piezoelectric heterostructural catalysts display exceptionally high efficiency on piezoelectrocatalytic redox reactions rather than in the piezocatalytic process. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;production rate of QMSH catalysts approaches &#8776;6456 &#181;mo1 g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and peaks at &#8776;16.8 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 8 h. The piezoelectrocatalytic process may be a promising method for treating industrial wastewater and producing clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An All&#8208;Round Athlete on the Track of Phototheranostics: Subtly Regulating the Balance between Radiative and Nonradiative Decays for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;round phototheranostic agent based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active fluorophore allowing fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), photothermal therapy (PTT), and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is constructed by subtly regulating the balance between radiative and nonradiative excited&#8208;state energy dissipations, which thus actualizes unprecedented performance on near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8211;PTT synergistic therapy.








Abstract
Aiming to achieve versatile phototheranostics with the integrated functionalities of multiple diagnostic imaging and synergistic therapy, the optimum use of dissipated energy through both radiative and nonradiative pathways is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. To the best of the knowledge, there have been no previous reports on a single molecular species effective at affording all phototheranostic modalities including fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, a simple and highly powerful one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active fluorophores is tactfully designed and constructed. Thanks to its strong electron donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and finely modulated intramolecular motion, the AIE fluorophore&#8208;based nanoparticles simultaneously exhibit bright near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency upon NIR irradiation, indicating the actualization of a balance between radiative and nonradiative energy dissipations. Furthermore, the unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8211;PTT synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination outcomes. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for practical cancer theranostics.

      <title>Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
Following the principal line of energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis, the structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance of hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) are discussed. Aiming at effective utilizations based on HoMSs in photocatalytic reactions, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategic methods are overviewed, along with a useful guidance for the future research directions of HoMSs photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) provide a promising platform for fabricating photocatalysts, because the unique structure optimizes the effective surface and mass transport, showing enhanced light absorption, optimized mass transport and highly effective active sites exposed. Subsequently, the rational design on HoMS photocatalytsts is elaborated to boost the photocatalytic activity with efforts in all dimensions, from nanoscale to microscale. Breakthroughs in synthetic methodology of HoMSs have greatly evoked the prosperous photocatalytic researches for HoMSs since the developing of sequential templating approach in 2009. The dawn of HoMS photocatalyst is coming after revealing the temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property, which is also discussed in this paper with pioneer works demonstrating the greatly enhanced energy/mass transfer processes. Some insights into the key challenges and perspectives of HoMSs photocatalysts are also discussed. With the reviewed fate and future of HoMSs photocatalysts, hopefully new concepts and innovative works can be inspired to flourish this sun&#8208;rise field.

      <title>Organic Bioelectronics: From Functional Materials to Next&#8208;Generation Devices and Power Sources</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers possess a unique set of features ideal for biointerfacing and setting them apart from other materials. This progress report highlights the identifying characteristics of these polymers put to use in bioelectronics and describes how each of these features enable device architectures with unique operation principles and a performance that is beyond the reach of their inorganic counterparts.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) possess a unique set of features setting them apart from other materials. These properties make them ideal when interfacing the biological world electronically. Their mixed electronic and ionic conductivity can be used to detect weak biological signals, deliver charged bioactive molecules, and mechanically or electrically stimulate tissues. CPs can be functionalized with various (bio)chemical moieties and blend with other functional materials, with the aim of modulating biological responses or endow specificity toward analytes of interest. They can absorb photons and generate electronic charges that are then used to stimulate cells or produce fuels. These polymers also have catalytic properties allowing them to harvest ambient energy and, along with their high capacitances, are promising materials for next&#8208;generation power sources integrated with bioelectronic devices. In this perspective, an overview of the key properties of CPs and examination of operational mechanism of electronic devices that leverage these properties for specific applications in bioelectronics is provided. In addition to discussing the chemical structure&#8211;functionality relationships of CPs applied at the biological interface, the development of new chemistries and form factors that would bring forth next&#8208;generation sensors, actuators, and their power sources, and, hence, advances in the field of organic bioelectronics is described.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908176, Joshua D. Caldwell, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso&#8208;Gonz&#225;lez, and co&#8208;workers extract the IR permittivity of the biaxial crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3 by correlative far&#8208; and near&#8208;field measurements, using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy and s&#8208;SNOM polariton interferometry, thus providing both an accurate permittivity model and a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. Moreover, through density functional theory, insights into the vibrational states dictating such permittivity are revealed.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019081761908176&lt;/a&gt;, Joshua D. Caldwell, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso&#8208;Gonz&#225;lez, and co&#8208;workers extract the IR permittivity of the biaxial crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by correlative far&#8208; and near&#8208;field measurements, using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy and s&#8208;SNOM polariton interferometry, thus providing both an accurate permittivity model and a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. Moreover, through density functional theory, insights into the vibrational states dictating such permittivity are revealed.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Selectively Suppressing Tumor Angiogenesis for Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy by Genetically Engineered Phage (Adv. Mater. 29/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Nontoxic phage virus nanofibers are genetically engineered by Mingying Yang, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001260 to first home to tumors through the blood circulation and then capture proteins that can promote blood vessel formation in the tumors. The phages are thus able to suppress tumor growth due to the inhibition of the tumor angiogenesis.

      <dc:description>
A switchable coating is developed by Jiaxi Cui and co&#8208;workers in article number 2000870 for controlling indoor temperature. In the transparent solid state, the coating allows sunlight permeation to induce solar heating to raise the ambient temperature in winter. After being alternated into the porous state, the coating can achieve efficient solar reflection and long&#8208;wave infrared emission to induce a sub&#8208;ambient temperature drop in summer.

      <title>Observation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and Exchange Interaction in Topological Insulator/Antiferromagnet Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
Quantum anomalous Hall effect is observed in a magnetic topological insulator/antiferromagnetic chromium oxide heterostructure. In the same material system, magnetic coupling is confirmed between the two thin films based on the observation of exchange bias effect and polarized neutron reflectometry result.








Abstract
Integration of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a magnetically ordered material provides an additional degree of freedom through which the resulting exotic quantum states can be controlled. Here, an experimental observation is reported of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a magnetically&#8208;doped topological insulator grown on the antiferromagnetic insulator Cr2O3. The exchange coupling between the two materials is investigated using field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry. Both techniques reveal strong interfacial interaction between the antiferromagnetic order of the Cr2O3 and the magnetic topological insulator, manifested as an exchange bias when the sample is field&#8208;cooled under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, and an exchange spring&#8208;like magnetic depth profile when the system is magnetized within the film plane. These results identify antiferromagnetic insulators as suitable candidates for the manipulation of magnetic and topological order in topological insulator films.

      <title>Recent Developments in Cellulose Nanomaterial Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Cellulose nanomaterial (CNM) composites are sustainable and can compete on strength and stiffness with traditional materials. Unfortunately, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites in manners practical to commercialization.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) are a class of materials that have recently garnered attention in fields as varied as structural materials, biomaterials, rheology modifiers, construction, paper enhancement, and others. As the principal structural reinforcement of biomass giving wood its mechanical properties, CNM is strong and stiff, but also nontoxic, biodegradable, and sustainable with a very large (Gton yr&#8722;1) source. Unfortunately, due to the relatively young nature of the field and inherent incompatibility of CNM with most man&#8208;made materials in use today, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Herein, efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites. The focus is on recent efforts attempting to mitigate common impediments to practical commercialization but is also placed in context with traditional efforts. The work is presented in terms of the progress made, and still to be made, on solving the most pressing challenges&#8212;getting properties that are competitive with currently used materials, removing organic solvent, solving the inherent incompatibility between CNM and polymers of interest, and incorporation into commonly used industrial processing techniques.

Unfortunately, due to the relatively young nature of the field and inherent incompatibility of CNM with most man&#8208;made materials in use today, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Herein, efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites. The focus is on recent efforts attempting to mitigate common impediments to practical commercialization but is also placed in context with traditional efforts. The work is presented in terms of the progress made, and still to be made, on solving the most pressing challenges&#8212;getting properties that are competitive with currently used materials, removing organic solvent, solving the inherent incompatibility between CNM and polymers of interest, and incorporation into commonly used industrial processing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Quality Microtubular Devices Fabricated via Dry&#8208;Etching for Optical and Microelectronic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Microdevices based on rolled&#8208;up nanomembranes are obtained at high yield and reproducibility utilizing a dry&#8208;release scheme based on SF6 plasma release. The high quality of the obtained electrical and optical devices is demonstrated by the simultaneous formation of high&#8208;performance rolled&#8208;up capacitors at wafer scale as well as by record&#8208;breaking rolled&#8208;up optical whispering gallery mode resonators.








Abstract
Mechanical strain formed at the interfaces of thin films has been widely applied to self&#8208;assemble 3D microarchitectures. Among them, rolled&#8208;up microtubes possess a unique 3D geometry beneficial for working as photonic, electromagnetic, energy storage, and sensing devices. However, the yield and quality of microtubular architectures are often limited by the wet&#8208;release of lithographically patterned stacks of thin&#8208;film structures. To address the drawbacks of conventionally used wet&#8208;etching methods in self&#8208;assembly techniques, here a dry&#8208;release approach is developed to roll&#8208;up both metallic and dielectric, as well as metallic/dielectric hybrid thin films for the fabrication of electronic and optical devices. A silicon thin film sacrificial layer on insulator is etched by dry fluorine chemistry, triggering self&#8208;assembly of prestrained nanomembranes in a well&#8208;controlled wafer scale fashion. More than 6000 integrated microcapacitors as well as hundreds of active microtubular optical cavities are obtained in a simultaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale self&#8208;assembled microdevices results in high yield, reproducibility, uniformity, and performance, which promise broad applications in microelectronics, photonics, and opto&#8208;electronics.

      <title>Coupling a Sponge Metal Fibers Skeleton with In Situ Surface Engineering to Achieve Advanced Electrodes for Flexible Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible 3D sponge nickel fibers skeleton plus in situ surface engineering strategy is developed to inhibit dendrite formation and polysulfide shuttling synergistically. The as&#8208;obtained electrodes exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance, confirmed by electric field simulations and theory calculations. Moreover, boosted cell performance is demonstrated in an assembled flexible lithium&#8211;sulfur battery device.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, however, the uncontrollable dendrite formation and serious polysulfide shuttling severely hinder their commercial success. Herein, a powerful 3D sponge nickel (SN) skeleton plus in situ surface engineering strategy, to address these issues synergistically, is reported, and a high&#8208;performance flexible LSB device is constructed. Specifically, the rationally designed spray&#8208;quenched lithium metal on the SN matrix (solid electrolyte interface (SEI)@Li/SN), as dendrite inhibitor, combines the merits of the 3D lithiophilic SN skeleton and the in situ formed SEI layer derived from the spray&#8208;quenching process, and thereby exhibits a steady overpotential within 75 mV for 1500 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mA h cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, in situ surface sulfurization of the SN skeleton hybridizing with the carbon/sulfur composite (SC@Ni3S2/SN) serves as efficient lithium polysulfide adsorbent to catalyze the overall reaction kinetics. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory calculations are further conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms. As a proof of concept, the well&#8208;designed SEI@Li/SN||SC@Ni3S2/SN full cell shows excellent electrochemical performance with a negative/positive ratio in capacity of &#8776;2 and capacity retention of 99.82% at 1 C under mechanical deformation. The novel design principles of these materials and electrodes successfully shed new light on the development of flexible LSBs.

      <title>A Transparent, Skin&#8208;Inspired Composite Film with Outstanding Tear Resistance Based on Flat Silk Cocoon</title>
      <dc:description>
A transparent, skin&#8208;inspired composite film is fabricated based on a flat silk cocoon and epoxy resin. The as&#8208;prepared fiber&#8208;reinforced film shows outstanding tear resistance because the silk fiber network successfully reduces stress concentration at the crack tip and suppresses crack propagation. Such composite films can also be used as mechanically robust supporting substrates for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Flexible and transparent substrates play a fundamental role as a mechanical support in advanced electronic devices. However, commonly used polymer films, such as polydimethylsiloxane, show low tear resistance because of their crack sensitivity. Herein, inspired by the excellent mechanical robustness of the skin and its fibrous structure, an epoxy&#8208;resin&#8208;based composite with a flat silk cocoon as a reinforcing fiber network is fabricated. With only 1 wt% of silk fiber, the tensile strength and modulus of the as&#8208;prepared composite film are considerably increased by 300% and 612% compared to those of pure resin, while still maintaining flexibility and transparency. More importantly, the composite shows remarkable tear resistance: without fracture after &#8776;30 000 tensile cycles. The potential application of such transparent composite films as mechanically robust substrates for flexible electronics is also demonstrated. In addition, this study represents a bioinspired strategy to construct high&#8208;performance functional composite materials.

      <title>Quantum Dots of [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+, Water Stable in Zeolite X, Luminesce Sharply in the Green</title>
      <dc:description>
Partially Cs+&#8208;exchanged zeolite X treated with PbBr2 is a water&#8208;stable green&#8208;emitting phosphor. Quantum dots of formula [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+ occupy its supercages. The FWHM of its emission is ultra&#8208;narrow, only about 17.6 nm. This is narrower than those of any of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and any of the &#8220;CsPbBr3 QDs&#8221; that have been introduced into various porous materials.








Abstract
Nanocrystals (NCs) of CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I, have excellent photoluminescent properties: high quantum yield, tunable emission wavelengths (410&#8722;700 nm), and narrow emission band widths. CsPbBr3 NCs show high promise as a green&#8208;emitting material for use in wide color gamut displays. CsPbBr3 NCs have, however, not been commercialized because they are sensitive to moisture and heat. To avoid these problems, this work attempts to introduce CsPbBr3 into five zeolites. The zeolite X product, Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X, shows superior stability toward moisture, maintaining its initial luminescence properties after being under water for more than a month. Its structure, determined using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, shows that quantum dots (QDs) of [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+ (not of CsPbBr3) have formed. They are tetrahedral PbBr42&#8722; ions (Pb&#8722;Br = 3.091(11) &#197;) surrounded by Na+ and Cs+ ions. Each fills the zeolite's supercage with its Pb2+ ion precisely at the center, a position of high symmetry. The peaks in the emission spectra of Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X and the CsPbBr3 NCs are both at about 520 nm. The FWHM of Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X, however, is narrower than any previously reported for any of the CsPbBr3 NCs, and for zeolite Y and the various mesoporous materials treated with CsPbBr3.

      <title>Ultralow&#8208;Transition&#8208;Energy Organic Complex on Graphene for High&#8208;Performance Shortwave Infrared Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>
Addressing the challenge of room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;sensitivity photodetection in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region, a novel SWIR absorbing organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor device with the photogating effect at the tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil/graphene interface is reported. It exhibits a tunable, high&#8208;speed, broadband vis&#8211;SWIR photoresponse and high specific detectivity (up to &#8776;1013 Jones) at a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;sensitivity, and broadband photodetection up to the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region is extremely significant for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications, including contamination identification, thermal imaging, night vision, agricultural inspection, and atmospheric remote sensing. Small&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based SWIR photodetectors generally require deep cooling to suppress thermally generated charge carriers to achieve increased sensitivity. Meanwhile, the photogating effect can provide an alternative way to achieve superior photosensitivity without the need for cooling. The optical photogating effect originates from charge trapping of photoinduced carriers at defects or interfaces, resulting in an extremely high photogain (106 or higher). Here, a highly sensitive SWIR hybrid photodetector, fabricated by integrating an organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor, is reported. The organic charge transfer complex (tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil) has an exceptional low&#8208;energy intermolecular electronic transition down to 0.5 eV, with the aim of achieving efficient SWIR absorption for wavelengths greater than 2 &#181;m. The photogating effect at the organic complex and graphene interface enables an extremely high photogain and a high detectivity of &#8776;1013 Jones, along with a response time of 8 ms, at room temperature for a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.

     alt="Ultralow&#8208;Transition&#8208;Energy Organic Complex on Graphene for High&#8208;Performance Shortwave Infrared Photodetection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the challenge of room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;sensitivity photodetection in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region, a novel SWIR absorbing organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor device with the photogating effect at the tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil/graphene interface is reported. It exhibits a tunable, high&#8208;speed, broadband vis&#8211;SWIR photoresponse and high specific detectivity (up to &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones) at a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;sensitivity, and broadband photodetection up to the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region is extremely significant for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications, including contamination identification, thermal imaging, night vision, agricultural inspection, and atmospheric remote sensing. Small&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based SWIR photodetectors generally require deep cooling to suppress thermally generated charge carriers to achieve increased sensitivity. Meanwhile, the photogating effect can provide an alternative way to achieve superior photosensitivity without the need for cooling. The optical photogating effect originates from charge trapping of photoinduced carriers at defects or interfaces, resulting in an extremely high photogain (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or higher). Here, a highly sensitive SWIR hybrid photodetector, fabricated by integrating an organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor, is reported. The organic charge transfer complex (tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil) has an exceptional low&#8208;energy intermolecular electronic transition down to 0.5 eV, with the aim of achieving efficient SWIR absorption for wavelengths greater than 2 &#181;m. The photogating effect at the organic complex and graphene interface enables an extremely high photogain and a high detectivity of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, along with a response time of 8 ms, at room temperature for a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Precise optical and thermal regulatory systems are found in nature, specifically in the microstructures on organisms&#8217; surfaces. The comprehensive control performance of light and heat integrated by these bioinspired microstructures are introduced and a solution strategy for the development of low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, intelligent thermal control instruments is provided.








Abstract
Precise optical and thermal regulatory systems are found in nature, specifically in the microstructures on organisms&#8217; surfaces. In fact, the interaction between light and matter through these microstructures is of great significance to the evolution and survival of organisms. Furthermore, the optical regulation by these biological microstructures is engineered owing to natural selection. Herein, the role that microstructures play in enhancing optical performance or creating new optical properties in nature is summarized, with a focus on the regulation mechanisms of the solar and infrared spectra emanating from the microstructures and their role in the field of thermal radiation. The causes of the unique optical phenomena are discussed, focusing on prevailing characteristics such as high absorption, high transmission, adjustable reflection, adjustable absorption, and dynamic infrared radiative design. On this basis, the comprehensive control performance of light and heat integrated by this bioinspired microstructure is introduced in detail and a solution strategy for the development of low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, intelligent thermal control instruments is discussed.

      <title>Engineering the Phases and Heterostructures of Ultrathin Hybrid Perovskite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin hybrid perovskite nanosheets are synthesized&#160;based on lead iodide templates. Multiple phases, such as PbI2, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, are flexibly designed and transformed as a single nanosheet through efficient cation exchange. By using other 2D materials as patterning masks and/or band alignment partner, artificial patterns, lateral, and vertical heterostructures of perovskite nanosheets are realized.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites have gained increasing attention recently, and engineering their material phases, structural patterning and interfacial properties is crucial for future perovskite&#8208;based applications. Here a phase and heterostructure engineering on ultrathin perovskites, through the reversible cation exchange of hybrid perovskites and efficient surface functionalization of low&#8208;dimensional materials, is demonstrated. Using PbI2 as precursor and template, perovskite nanosheets of varying thickness and hexagonal shape on diverse substrates is obtained. Multiple phases, such as PbI2, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, can be flexibly designed and transformed as a single nanosheet. A perovskite nanosheet can be patterned using masks made of 2D materials, fabricating lateral heterostructures of perovskite and PbI2. Perovskite&#8208;based vertical heterostructures show strong interfacial coupling with 2D materials. As a demonstration, monolayer MoS2/MAPbI3 stacks give a type&#8208;II heterojunction. The ability to combine the optically efficient perovskites with versatile 2D materials creates possibilities for new designs and functionalities.

Abstract
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Therefore, expansion of the use of CO2&#8208;accumulating nanocelluloses is expected to partly contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society and help overcome current global environmental issues. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. All of these materials are first obtained as aqueous dispersions. In particular, cellulose nanofibrils have homogeneous &#8776;3 nm widths and average lengths of &gt;500 nm, and significant amounts of charged groups are present on their surfaces. Such charged groups are formed by carboxymethylation, C6&#8208;carboxylation, phosphorylation, phosphite esterification, xanthation, sulfate esterification, and C2/C3 dicarboxylation during the pretreatment of plant cellulose fibers before their conversion into cellulose nanofibrils via mechanical disintegration in water. These surface&#8208;charged groups in nanocelluloses can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged into diverse metal and alkylammonium ions, resulting in surface&#8208;modified nanocelluloses with various new functions including hydrophobic, water&#8208;resistant, catalytic, superdeodorant, and gas&#8208;separation properties. However, many fundamental and application&#8208;related issues facing nanocelluloses must first be overcome to enable their further expansion.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Bacterial Reactivation by Restraining within a Triggerable Nanocoating</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacteria being tailored to perform therapeutic effects precisely in the right place at the right time to avoid potential side effects is important but has proven to be challenging. Here, a strategy of on&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation is described by restraining within a triggerable nanocoating. Upon reaching at a location of interest, the bacteria can be liberated to reactivate as needed.








Abstract
Bacteria have been widely exploited as bioagents for applications in diagnosis and treatment, benefitting from their living characteristics including colonization, rapid proliferation, and facile genetic manipulation. As such, bacteria being tailored to perform precisely in the right place at the right time to avoid potential side effects would be of great importance but has proven to be difficult. Here, a strategy of on&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation is described by individually restraining within a triggerable nanocoating. Upon reaching at a location of interest, nanocoatings can be triggered to dissolution in situ and subsequently decoat the bacteria which are able to recover their bioactivities as needed. It is demonstrated that gut microbiota coated with an enteric nanocoating can respond to gastrointestinal environments and reactivate in the intestine by a pH&#8208;triggered decoating. In virtue of this unique, coated bacteria remain inactive following oral administration to exempt acidic insults, while revive to restore therapeutic effects after gastric emptying. Consequently, improved oral availability and treatment efficacy are achieved in two mouse models of intestinal infection. Bacteria restrained by a triggerable nanocoating represent a smart therapeutic that can take effect when necessary. On&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation suggests a robust platform for the development of precision bacterial&#8208;mediated bioagents.

      <title>Crystal&#8211;Glass High&#8208;Entropy Nanocomposites with Near Theoretical Compressive Strength and Large Deformability</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel crystal&#8211;glass high&#8208;entropy nanocomposite with near theoretical yield strength and large deformability is achieved by controlling both the stacking fault energy in the high&#8208;entropy nanotwinned crystalline phase and the glass&#8208;forming&#8208;ability in the metallic glass phase. The mutually compatible flow behavior of the glass phase and the dislocation flux in the crystals enable homogeneous plastic co&#8208;deformation of the two regions.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and metallic glasses (MGs) are two material classes based on the massive mixing of multiple&#8208;principal elements. HEAs are single or multiphase crystalline solid solutions with high ductility. MGs with amorphous structure have superior strength but usually poor ductility. Here, the stacking fault energy in the high&#8208;entropy nanotwinned crystalline phase and the glass&#8208;forming&#8208;ability in the MG phase of the same material are controlled, realizing a novel nanocomposite with near theoretical yield strength (G/24, where G is the shear modulus of a material) and homogeneous plastic strain above 45% in compression. The mutually compatible flow behavior of the MG phase and the dislocation flux in the crystals enable homogeneous plastic co&#8208;deformation of the two regions. This crystal&#8211;glass high&#8208;entropy nanocomposite design concept provides a new approach to developing advanced materials with an outstanding combination of strength and ductility.

The mutually compatible flow behavior of the MG phase and the dislocation flux in the crystals enable homogeneous plastic co&#8208;deformation of the two regions. This crystal&#8211;glass high&#8208;entropy nanocomposite design concept provides a new approach to developing advanced materials with an outstanding combination of strength and ductility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enhanced and Balanced Charge Transport Boosting Ternary Solar Cells Over 17% Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly efficient organic solar cell with a ternary architecture is successfully demonstrated by enhancing and balancing charge transport as well as matching integer charge transfer energy in bulk heterojunction blend. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 17.13% is obtained with the significantly improved fill factor of 0.813.








Abstract
Ternary architecture is one of the most effective strategies to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, an OSC with a ternary architecture featuring a highly crystalline molecular donor DRTB&#8208;T&#8208;C4 as a third component to the host binary system consisting of a polymer donor PM6 and a nonfullerene acceptor Y6 is reported. The third component is used to achieve enhanced and balanced charge transport, contributing to an improved fill factor (FF) of 0.813 and yielding an impressive PCE of 17.13%. The heterojunctions are designed using so&#8208;called pinning energies to promote exciton separation and reduce recombination loss. In addition, the preferential location of DRTB&#8208;T&#8208;C4 at the interface between PM6 and Y6 plays an important role in optimizing the morphology of the active layer.

      <title>Cellular Structured CNTs@SiO2 Nanofibrous Aerogels with Vertically Aligned Vessels for Salt&#8208;Resistant Solar Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Salt&#8208;resistant carbon nanotubes@SiO2 nanofibrous aerogels with vertically aligned vessels and porous vessel walls are fabricated for solar desalination. Because of this structure, aerogels have excellent salt&#8208;resistance without salt crystal on the surface even in 20% brine and 6&#8208;sun irradiation. Moreover, this material exhibits a light absorbance of 98% and an evaporation rate of 1.50 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation.








Abstract
The emerging solar desalination technology is considered as one of the most promising strategies to ensure water security. However, with the proceeding of solar desalination, salt crystallization on the surface of solar evaporators caused by increasing salinity of seawater will result in a decrease in the evaporation rate. Thus, it is still challenging to fabricate solar evaporators with superior salt resistance. In this work, elastic ceramic&#8208;based nanofibrous aerogels with a cellular architecture are fabricated by the combination of electrospinning and fiber freeze&#8208;shaping technologies, which are composed of vertically aligned vessels and porous vessel walls. Under the action of convection and diffusion promoted by this unique cellular architecture, the aerogels exhibit a superior salt&#8208;resistance without any salt crystals on the surface of aerogels even in 20% brine and under 6&#8208;sun irradiation. Moreover, by virtue of the synergistic effect of the promising structure and light absorbance of carbon nanotubes, aerogels possess a high light absorbance of up to 98% and excellent evaporation performance achieving 1.50 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation. This work may provide a fascinating avenue for the desalination of seawater in a salt&#8208;resistance and efficient manner.

      <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Fe Catalysts for Effective Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile and general PCP strategy is developed to synthesize SAS catalysts. This PCP strategy can be expended to synthesize a series of SAS catalysts including SAS&#8208;Fe, SAS&#8208;Ni, SAS&#8208;Cu, SAS&#8208;Zn, SAS&#8208;Ru, SAS&#8208;Rh, SAS&#8208;Pd, SAS&#8208;Pt, and SAS&#8208;Ir. Moreover, SAS&#8208;Fe shows excellent catalytic performance in the epoxidation of styrene using 1 atm O2 as the only oxidant.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site (SAS) catalysts, a new frontier of catalysts, always show extremely high atom efficiency and unexpected catalytic properties. Herein, a pyrolyzing coordinated polymer (PCP) strategy is developed, which is facile and widely applicable in the synthesis of a series of SAS catalysts including SAS&#8208;Fe, SAS&#8208;Ni, SAS&#8208;Cu, SAS&#8208;Zn, SAS&#8208;Ru, SAS&#8208;Rh, SAS&#8208;Pd, SAS&#8208;Pt, and SAS&#8208;Ir. The as&#8208;obtained SAS catalysts can be easily synthesized at gram scale and the metal loading of SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts achieves a record value of 30 wt%, which meets the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, it is discovered that SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts show unprecedented catalytic performance for epoxidation of styrene using O2 as the only oxidant (yield: 64%; selectivity: 89%), while Fe nanoparticles and ironporphyrin are inactive. This discovery is believed to pave the way for exploiting the unparalleled properties of SAS catalysts and promoting their industrial applications.

Abstract
High&#8208;strength petroleum&#8208;based materials like plastics have been widely used in various fields, but their nonbiodegradability has caused serious pollution problems. Cellulose, as the most abundant sustainable polymer, has a great chance to act as the ideal substitute for plastics due to its low cost, wide availability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, the recent achievements for developing cellulose &#8220;green&#8221; solvents and regenerated cellulose materials with high strength via the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route are presented. Cellulose can be regenerated to produce films/membranes, hydrogels/aerogels, filaments/fibers, microspheres/beads, bioplastics, etc., which show potential applications in textiles, biomedicine, energy storage, packaging, etc. Importantly, these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be biodegraded in soil and oceans, reducing environmental pollution. The cellulose solvents, dissolving mechanism, and strategies for constructing the regenerated cellulose functional materials with high strength and performances, together with the current achievements and urgent challenges are summarized, and some perspectives are also proposed. The near future will be an exciting era for high&#8208;strength biodegradable and renewable materials. The hope is that many environmentally friendly materials with good properties and low cost will be produced for commercial use, which will be beneficial for sustainable development in the world.

      <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type Solid Solution Nano&#8208;Electrocatalysts Enable Simultaneously Enhanced Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
The importance of synergistic optimization of bulk and surface properties for breaking inverse relation of catalytic activity and structural stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, with SrIrO3 as a model material, is demonstrated. An alloying strategy is presented to achieve this goal and results in a high&#8208;performance SrZrO3&#8211;SrIrO3 solid&#8208;solution electrocatalyst for the acidic OER.








Abstract
A trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and structural stability generally exists in oxygen evolution electrocatalysis, especially in acidic environment. This dilemma limits the development of higher&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that are required by next&#8208;generation electrochemical technologies. Here it is demonstrated that the inverse catalytic activity&#8211;structural stability relation can be broken by alloying catalytically inert strontium zirconate with the other catalytically active perovskite, strontium iridate. This strategy results in an alloyed perovskite electrocatalyst with simultaneously improved iridium mass activity and structural stability, by about five times, for the oxygen evolution reaction under acidic conditions. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the alloying strategy generates multiple positive effects, mainly including the reduction of catalyst size, the decrease of catalyst covalency, and the weakening of surface oxygen&#8208;binding ability. The synergistic optimization of bulk and surface properties, as a result, enhances the intrinsic activity and availability of surface iridium sites, whilst significantly inhibiting the surface cation corrosion during electrocatalysis.

      <title>The True Amphipathic Nature of Graphene Flakes: A Versatile 2D Stabilizer</title>
      <dc:description>
Pristine graphene flakes are 2D amphiphiles with well&#8208;defined hydrophilic edges and hydrophobic basal plane surfaces, the interplay of which allows small flakes to be utilized as stabilizers. The interactions between flakes can be controlled by varying the flake size and the oil&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. Pristine graphene flakes can stabilize water/oil emulsions even under high pressure, high temperature, and in saline solutions.








Abstract
The fundamental colloidal properties of pristine graphene flakes remain incompletely understood, with conflicting reports about their chemical character, hindering potential applications that could exploit the extraordinary electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of graphene. Here, the true amphipathic nature of pristine graphene flakes is demonstrated through wet&#8208;chemistry testing, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo calculations, and it is shown how this fact paves the way for the formation of ultrastable water/oil emulsions. In contrast to commonly used graphene oxide flakes, pristine graphene flakes possess well&#8208;defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions: the basal plane and edges, respectively, the interplay of which allows small flakes to be utilized as stabilizers with an amphipathic strength that depends on the edge&#8208;to&#8208;surface ratio. The interactions between flakes can be also controlled by varying the oil&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. In addition, it is predicted that graphene flakes can be efficiently used as a new&#8208;generation stabilizer that is active under high pressure, high temperature, and in saline solutions, greatly enhancing the efficiency and functionality of applications based on this&#160;material.

      <title>Applications of Nanomaterials in Asymmetric Photocatalysis: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis well meets the strict demands of the modern chemistry industry and has attracted great interest in recent decades. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in asymmetric photocatalysis by heterogeneous nanomaterials is reviewed. The discussion comprises two sections based on the type of nanomaterials: inorganic semiconductors and porous materials. Finally, challenges and future developments of heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis are proposed.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is one of the most attractive strategies to obtain important enantiomerically pure chemicals with high quality and production. In addition, thanks to the abundant and sustainable advantages of solar energy, photocatalysis possesses great potential in environmentally benign reactions. Undoubtedly, asymmetric photocatalysis meets the strict demand of modern chemistry: environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;sustainable alternatives. Compared with homogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis has features of easy separation, recovery, and reuse merits, thus being cost&#8208; and time&#8208;effective. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in asymmetric photocatalysis by heterogeneous nanomaterials is addressed. The discussion comprises two sections based on the type of nanomaterials: typical inorganic semiconductors like TiO2 and quantum dots and emerging porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and organic cages. Finally, the challenges and future developments of heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis are proposed.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2001675, Uriel Levy, Shlomo Magdassi, and co&#8208;workers report transparent yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) gain&#8208;medium structures at micrometer&#8208;size, using 3D printing based on two&#8208;photon polymerization of inks composed only of solutions. The printed objects are polycrystalline, and, upon doping with Nd, light emission is enabled. 3D printing of gain media at the microscale may be used for lighting and lasing, as well as other exciting optical applications.

      <title>Wearable Sensors: Large&#8208;Scale Patterning of Reactive Surfaces for Wearable and Environmentally Deployable Sensors (Adv. Mater. 28/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001258, Fiorenzo G. Omenetto and co&#8208;workers present a complementary approach to wearable sensing, wherein they use bioactive biomaterial&#8208;based inks to print and stabilize deterministic patterns of biochemical reporters with high resolution. They develop a T&#8208;shirt based on a colorimetric pattern as an example of a large&#8208;area wearable sensing platform. Such sensing inks have application potential in areas like epidemiology, disease tracking, and monitoring air quality.

      <dc:description>
Ferroelectric tunnel junctions are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory devices, which exhibit attractive advantages of high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Recent advances in tunneling electroresistance and the emerging physics of ferroelectric tunnel junctions with electronic and ionic modulations on tunneling barrier profiles are discussed and the potential applications are outlined.








Abstract
Recently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have attracted considerable attention for potential applications in next&#8208;generation memories, owing to attractive advantages such as high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Herein, recent progress regarding FTJ devices is reviewed with an emphasis on the modulation of the potential barrier. Electronic and ionic approaches that modulate the ferroelectric barriers themselves and/or induce extra barriers in electrodes or at ferroelectric/electrode interfaces are discussed with the enhancement of memory performance. Emerging physics, such as nanoscale ferroelectricity, resonant tunneling, and interfacial metallization, and the applications of FTJs in nonvolatile data storage, neuromorphic synapse emulation, and electromagnetic multistate memory are summarized. Finally, challenges and perspectives of FTJ devices are underlined.

      <title>Chromatic Dispersion Manipulation Based on Metalenses</title>
      <dc:description>
The metalens is one of the most basic and important applications of metasurfaces. The noticeable achievements over the past few years in the field of chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses are highlighted, especially in the development of achromatic metalenses. A perspective on this specific branch of applications and future prospects are also presented.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are 2D metamaterials composed of subwavelength nanoantennas according to specific design. They have been utilized to precisely manipulate various parameters of light fields, such as phase, polarization, amplitude, etc., showing promising functionalities. Among all meta&#8208;devices, the metalens can be considered as the most basic and important application, given its significant advantage in integration and miniaturization compared with traditional lenses. However, the resonant dispersion of each nanoantenna in a metalens and the intrinsic chromatic dispersion of planar devices and optical materials result in a large chromatic aberration in metalenses that severely reduces the quality of their focusing and imaging. Consequently, how to effectively suppress or manipulate the chromatic aberration of metalenses has attracted worldwide attention in the last few years, leading to variety of excellent achievements promoting the development of this field. Herein, recent progress in chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses is reviewed.

      <title>The Jeff = 1/2 Antiferromagnet Sr2IrO4: A Golden Avenue toward New Physics and Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The perovskite Sr2IrO4 hosts a novel Jeff = 1/2 state related to strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and represents a rare example of iridates that is better understood both theoretically and experimentally. In the last decade, fascinating electronic properties have been revealed in this material. These developments are reviewed with regard to two aspects: fundamentals and functions.








Abstract
Iridates have been providing a fertile ground for studying emergent phases of matter that arise from the delicate interplay of various fundamental interactions with approximate energy scale. Among these highly focused quantum materials, the perovskite Sr2IrO4, which belongs to the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper series, stands out and has been intensively addressed in the last decade, since it hosts a novel Jeff = 1/2 state that is a profound manifestation of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Moreover, the Jeff = 1/2 state represents a rare example of iridates that is better understood both theoretically and experimentally. Here, Sr2IrO4 is taken as an example to review the recent advances of the Jeff = 1/2 state in two aspects: materials fundamentals and functionality potentials. In the fundamentals part, the basic issues for the layered canted antiferromagnetic order of the Jeff = 1/2 magnetic moments in Sr2IrO4 are illustrated, and then the progress of the antiferromagnetic order modulation through diverse routes is highlighted. Subsequently, for the functionality potentials, fascinating properties such as atomic&#8208;scale giant magnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and nonvolatile memory, are addressed. To conclude, prospective remarks and an outlook are given.

&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 magnetic moments in Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are illustrated, and then the progress of the antiferromagnetic order modulation through diverse routes is highlighted. Subsequently, for the functionality potentials, fascinating properties such as atomic&#8208;scale giant magnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and nonvolatile memory, are addressed.

      <dc:description>
Precise location, orientation, and layout controls of self&#8208;assembled semiconducting nanowires, grown or transferred on planar substrates, are indispensable capabilities to accomplish scalable electronic device integration. The latest technologies developed for achieving orderly in&#8208;plane guided growth, transferring, and integration of inorganic nanowires are reviewed, followed by a summary of their device applications in logic applications, photodetectors, stretchable electronics, and 3D stacked&#8208;channel integration.








Abstract
Silicon and other inorganic semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been extensively investigated in the last two decades for constructing high&#8208;performance nanoelectronics, sensors, and optoelectronics. For many of these applications, these tiny building blocks have to be integrated into the existing planar electronic platform, where precise location, orientation, and layout controls are indispensable. In the advent of More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore's era, there are also emerging demands for a programmable growth engineering of the geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape of NWs on planar or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane 3D sidewall surfaces. Here, the critical technologies established for synthesis, transferring, and assembly of NWs upon planar surface are examined; then, the recent progress of in&#8208;plane growth of horizontal NWs directly upon crystalline or patterned substrates, constrained by using nanochannels, an epitaxial interface, or amorphous thin film precursors is discussed. Finally, the unique capabilities of planar growth of NWs in achieving precise guided growth control, programmable geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape engineering are reviewed, followed by their latest device applications in building high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, stretchable electronics, and 3D stacked&#8208;channel integration.

      <title>The Material Efforts for Quantized Hall Devices Based on Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological insulators (TIs) are materials hosting exotic topological quantum effects including the quantum Hall effect and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The material development history of TIs and magnetic TIs and recent research progress are reviewed, focusing on the realization of these quantized transports, which will promote fundamental research and potential applications in the future.








Abstract
A topological insulator (TI) is a kind of novel material hosting a topological band structure and plenty of exotic topological quantum effects. Achieving quantized electrical transport, including the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), is an important aspect of realizing quantum devices based on TI materials. Intense efforts are made in this field, in which the most essential research is based on the optimization of realistic TI materials. Herein, the TI material development process is reviewed, focusing on the realization of quantized transport. Especially, for QHE, the strategies to increase the surface transport ratio and decrease the threshold magnetic field of QHE are examined. For QAHE, the evolution history of magnetic TIs is introduced, and the recently discovered magnetic TI candidates with intrinsic magnetizations are discussed in detail. Moreover, future research perspectives on these novel topological quantum effects are also evaluated.

      <dc:description>
Hybrid nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with integration of quantum dots for high&#8208;performance red/green/blue/white emissions, plasmonic nanolasers operating with ultralow excitation threshold from green to ultraviolet tunable spectral range, and solar&#8208;blind avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a record&#8208;high gain, are demonstrated. These newest advances in micro/nano&#8208;LEDs, nanolasers, and APDs can shed light on the emerging capabilities of III&#8208;nitride in cutting&#8208;edge applications.








Abstract
In the last two decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of optoelectronic devices based on III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. In terms of photonics applications in the visible&#8211;UV spectral range, III&#8208;nitrides are one of the most promising materials. For instance, emerging gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) technology for high&#8208;resolution display, and UV photo&#8208;detection for environmental monitoring, health, and medical applications. In this work, hybrid micro/nano&#8208;LEDs with integration of II&#8211;VI quantum dots by means of lithography and nano&#8208;imprinting patterning techniques are demonstrated, and high&#8208;performance red/green/blue and white emissions are achieved. Consequently, plasmonic nanolasers are designed and fabricated using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structure, where strong surface plasmon polariton coupling leads to the efficient lasing with a low excitation threshold from the visible to UV tunable spectral range. Furthermore, performance&#8208;improved AlGaN UV solar&#8208;blind avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a separate absorption and multiplication structure by polarization engineering are reported. These APDs deliver a record&#8208;high avalanche gain of up to 1.6 &#215; 105. These newest advances in nano/micro&#8208;LEDs, nanolasers, and APDs can shed light on the emerging capabilities of III&#8208;nitride in cutting&#8208;edge applications.

      <title>Electrode Materials Engineering in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Energy Input and Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrode materials are considered to be important components for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, as they affect the energy input method and CO2 conversion efficiencies. Various photo&#8208;anode and bio&#8208;anode materials for lowering external bias and progress on cathode catalysts for improving CO2 conversion efficiencies are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, enhancement strategies in the design of these electrode materials are highlighted.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising technology to simultaneously alleviate CO2&#8208;caused climate hazards and ever&#8208;increasing energy demands, as it can utilize CO2 in the atmosphere to provide the required feedstocks for industrial production and daily life. In recent years, substantial progress in ECR systems has been achieved by the exploitation of various novel electrode materials. The anodic materials and cathodic catalysts that have, respectively, led to high&#8208;efficiency energy input and effective heterogenous catalytic conversion in ECR systems are comprehensively reviewed. Based on the differences in the nature of energy sources and the role of materials used at the anode, the fundamentals of ECR systems, including photo&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems and bio&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems, are explained in detail. Additionally, the cathodic reaction mechanisms and pathways of ECR are described along with a discussion of different design strategies for cathode catalysts to enhance conversion efficiency and selectivity. The emerging challenges and some perspective on both anode materials and cathodic catalysts are also outlined for better development of ECR systems.

      <title>Photonic Metamaterial Absorbers: Morphology Engineering and Interdisciplinary Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic metamaterial absorbers (PMAs) are reviewed, focusing on their morphology engineering and interdisciplinary applications. Feasible methods to tailor the subwavelength&#8208;scale structures of PMAs for optimizing their absorption performances are presented. Incorporated with interdisciplinary techniques, the application of PMAs in coloration, sensing, steam generation, and photodetection is also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in nanofabrication technologies have spurred many breakthroughs in the field of photonic metamaterials that provide efficient ways of manipulating light&#8211;matter interaction at subwavelength scales. As one of the most important applications, photonic metamaterials can be used to implement novel optical absorbers. First the morphology engineering of various photonic metamaterial absorbers is discussed, which is highly associated with impendence matching conditions and resonance modes of the absorbers, thus directly determines their absorption efficiency, operational bandwidth, incident angle, and polarization dependence. Then, the recent achievements of various interdisciplinary applications based on photonic metamaterial absorbers, including structural color generation, ultrasensitive optical sensing, solar steam generation, and highly responsive photodetection, are reviewed. This report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development of photonic metamaterial absorbers and their applications in novel nanophotonic systems.

As one of the most important applications, photonic metamaterials can be used to implement novel optical absorbers. First the morphology engineering of various photonic metamaterial absorbers is discussed, which is highly associated with impendence matching conditions and resonance modes of the absorbers, thus directly determines their absorption efficiency, operational bandwidth, incident angle, and polarization dependence. Then, the recent achievements of various interdisciplinary applications based on photonic metamaterial absorbers, including structural color generation, ultrasensitive optical sensing, solar steam generation, and highly responsive photodetection, are reviewed. This report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development of photonic metamaterial absorbers and their applications in novel nanophotonic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrodeposition Technologies for Li&#8208;Based Batteries: New Frontiers of Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces and demonstrates the advantages of controlling material thickness, engineering interfaces, and realizing a conformal coating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress in electrodeposition technologies for Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized.








Abstract
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces, distinguishing it from the widely used solid&#8208;state technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition drives uphill reactions by applying electric energy instead of heating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress of electrodeposition technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized. Each component of Li&#8208;based batteries can be electrodeposited or synthesized with multiple methods. The advantages of electrodeposition are the main focus, and they are discussed in comparison with traditional technologies with the expectation to inspire innovations to build better Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition coats conformal films on surfaces and can control the film thickness, providing an effective approach to enhancing battery performance. Engineering interfaces by electrodeposition can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and strengthen the adhesion of active materials to substrates, thereby prolonging the battery longevity. Lastly, a perspective of future studies on electrodepositing batteries is provided. The significant merits of electrodeposition should greatly advance the development of Li&#8208;based batteries.

      <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocages: A New Platform for Advanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based nanocages have emerged as a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion owing to their hollow interior cavity with microchannels across the shells, their high specific surface area with defective outer surface, and their tunable electronic structure. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on the synthesis, encapsulating/supporting of carbon&#8208;based nanocages and their applications is presented, along with the research challenges and trends.








Abstract
Energy storage and conversion play a crucial role in modern energy systems, and the exploration of advanced electrode materials is vital but challenging. Carbon&#8208;based nanocages consisting of sp2 carbon shells feature a hollow interior cavity with sub&#8208;nanometer microchannels across the shells, high specific surface area with a defective outer surface, and tunable electronic structure, much different from the intensively studied nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. These structural and morphological characteristics make carbon&#8208;based nanocages a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date synthetic strategies of carbon&#8208;based nanocages, the utilization of their unique porous structure and morphology for the construction of composites with foreign active species, and their significant applications to the advanced energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Structure&#8211;performance correlations are discussed in depth to highlight the contribution of carbon&#8208;based nanocages. The research challenges and trends are also envisaged for deepening and extending the study and application of this multifunctional material.

Abstract
Engineered nanomaterials have been extensively employed as therapeutics for tumor management. Meanwhile, the complex tumor niche along with multiple barriers at the cellular level collectively hinders the action of nanomedicines. Here, the advanced strategies that hold promise for overcoming the numerous biological barriers facing nanomedicines are summarized. Starting from tumor entry, methods that promote tissue penetration of nanomedicine and address the hypoxia issue are also highlighted. Then, emphasis is given to the significance of overcoming both physical barriers, such as membrane&#8208;associated efflux pumps, and biological features, such as resistance to apoptosis. The pros and cons for an individual approach are presented. In addition, the associated technical problems are discussed, along with the importance of balancing the therapeutic merits and the additional cost of sophisticated nanomedicine designs.

      <dc:description>
Broadband electromagnetic response is often required in the applications of metastructures. It is therefore important to reassess the principles of constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and some trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed. Perspectives are given on the development of broadband metastructured materials.








Abstract
Electromagnetic metastructures stand for the artificial structures with a characteristic size smaller than the wavelength, which may efficiently manipulate the states of light. However, their applications are often restricted by the bandwidth of the electromagnetic response of the metastructures. It is therefore essential to reassert the principles in constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Herein, after summarizing the conventional approaches for achieving broadband electromagnetic functionality, some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and several trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed, followed by some perspectives for the future development of broadband metamaterials. It is anticipated that broadband metastructures will have even more substantial applications in optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and information technology.

      <title>Nonlinear Beam Shaping in Domain Engineered Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonlinear holography is a universal technique for nonlinear beam shaping, in which the nonlinear polarization wave acts as the reference beam, while the harmonic wave acts as the object beam. The interference fringe is imprinted onto a nonlinear crystal with modulated domain patterns. This method can be used to engineer the wave front of an arbitrary harmonic wave.








Abstract
Domain engineered ferroelectric crystals are a type of microstructure functional material that is used widely in the area of nonlinear optics.

&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear holography is a universal technique for nonlinear beam shaping, in which the nonlinear polarization wave acts as the reference beam, while the harmonic wave acts as the object beam. The interference fringe is imprinted onto a nonlinear crystal with modulated domain patterns. This method can be used to engineer the wave front of an arbitrary harmonic wave.


&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tin and Mixed Lead&#8211;Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress and their Application in Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress of tin and mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskite solar cells is summarized, including an introduction of device structures, fabrication methods, strategies to improve both performance and stability, and an outlook of pure tin&#8208;based halide, mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide, and monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have recently attracted enormous attention for photovoltaic applications due to their superior optical and electrical properties. Lead (Pb) halide perovskites stand out among this material series, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%. According to the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit, lead halide perovskites typically exhibit bandgaps that are not within the optimal range for single&#8208;junction solar cells. Partial or complete replacement of lead with tin (Sn) is gaining increasing research interest, due to the promise of further narrowing the bandgaps. This enables ideal solar utilization for single&#8208;junction solar cells as well as the construction of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. In addition, the usage of Sn provides a path to the fabrication of lead&#8208;free or Pb&#8208;reduced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Recent progress in addressing the challenges of fabricating efficient Sn halide and mixed lead&#8211;tin (Pb&#8211;Sn) halide PSCs is summarized herein. Mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskites hold promise not only for higher efficiency and more stable single&#8208;junction solar cells but also for efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem solar cells.

      <title>Electrochemical and Structural Analysis in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries by Analytical Electron Microscopy: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with high energy density and safety are attracting tremendous attention. Progress in the characterization of the microstructure and dynamic behavior for batteries using ex situ/in situ transmission electron microscopy is systematically reviewed. Potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and ptychographic phase imaging to alleviate radiation damage and enhance image contrast of light atoms are discussed as a perspective.








Abstract
Advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and its associated instruments have made significant contributions to the characterization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li batteries, as these tools provide localized information on the structure, morphology, chemistry, and electronic state of electrodes, electrolytes, and their interfaces at the nano&#8208; and atomic scale. Furthermore, the rapid development of in situ techniques has enabled a deep understanding of interfacial dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics during the cycling process. However, due to the beam&#8208;sensitive nature of light elements in the interphases, e.g., Li and O, thorough and reliable studies of the interfacial structure and chemistry at an ultrahigh spatial resolution without beam damage is still a formidable challenge. Herein, the following points are discussed: (1) the recent contributions of advanced STEM to the study of ASS Li batteries; (2) current challenges associated with using this method; and (3) potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and the STEM phase contrast imaging techniques.

The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are discussed, and the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers along with some examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are summarized.

Abstract
Self&#8208;healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded. Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many self&#8208;healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient self&#8208;healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal ions or ligands and dynamic metal&#8211;ligand bonds, self&#8208;healing polymers can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;memory behavior. Herein, the recent developments and achievements made in the field of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are highlighted, the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers are summarized, and examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are given.

      <title>Graphene Hybrid Structures for Integrated and Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Low light absorption and inefficient carrier extraction are two fundamental limitations in graphene photodetectors. Recent progress in using graphene hybrid structures to enable highly sensitive, broadband, and ultrafast optoelectronic devices, and their potential applications in integrated and flexible electronics are reviewed.








Abstract
Graphene (Gr) has many unique properties including gapless band structure, ultrafast carrier dynamics, high carrier mobility, and flexibility, making it appealing for ultrafast, broadband, and flexible optoelectronics. To overcome its intrinsic limit of low absorption, hybrid structures are exploited to improve the device performance. Particularly, van der Waals heterostructures with different photosensitive materials and photonic structures are very effective for improving photodetection and modulation efficiency. With such hybrid structures, Gr hybrid photodetectors can operate from ultraviolet to terahertz, with significantly improved R (up to 109 A W&#8722;1) and bandwidth (up to 128 GHz). Furthermore, integration of Gr with silicon (Si) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, the human body, and soft tissues is successfully demonstrated, opening promising opportunities for wearable sensors and biomedical electronics. Here, the recent progress in using Gr hybrid structures toward high&#8208;performance photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic applications is reviewed.

Recent progress in using graphene hybrid structures to enable highly sensitive, broadband, and ultrafast optoelectronic devices, and their potential applications in integrated and flexible electronics are reviewed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene (Gr) has many unique properties including gapless band structure, ultrafast carrier dynamics, high carrier mobility, and flexibility, making it appealing for ultrafast, broadband, and flexible optoelectronics. To overcome its intrinsic limit of low absorption, hybrid structures are exploited to improve the device performance. Particularly, van der Waals heterostructures with different photosensitive materials and photonic structures are very effective for improving photodetection and modulation efficiency. With such hybrid structures, Gr hybrid photodetectors can operate from ultraviolet to terahertz, with significantly improved &lt;i&gt;R &lt;/i&gt; (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and bandwidth (up to 128 GHz). Furthermore, integration of Gr with silicon (Si) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, the human body, and soft tissues is successfully demonstrated, opening promising opportunities for wearable sensors and biomedical electronics. Here, the recent progress in using Gr hybrid structures toward high&#8208;performance photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic applications is reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Materials Under Stress: In Situ TEM Observations of Structural Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Several examples of current progress regarding in situ mechanical scanning/transmission electron microscopy techniques are addressed. Probing of local microstructures from atomic to micrometer scales in functional materials that are under high stress loads is possible. Advancements of these state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques make it possible to study the behavior of materials with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.








Abstract
The operating conditions of functional materials usually involve varying stress fields, resulting in structural changes, whether intentional or undesirable. Complex multiscale microstructures including defects, domains, and new phases, can be induced by mechanical loading in functional materials, providing fundamental insight into the deformation process of the involved materials. On the other hand, these microstructures, if induced in a controllable fashion, can be used to tune the functional properties or to enhance certain performance. In situ nanomechanical tests conducted in scanning/transmission electron microscopes (STEM/TEM) provide a critical tool for understanding the microstructural evolution in functional materials. Here, select results on a variety of functional material systems in the field are presented, with a brief introduction into some newly developed multichannel experimental capabilities to demonstrate the impact of these techniques.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Mediated Geometric Phase: From Transmissive to Broadband Reflective Planar Optics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the liquid&#8208;crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated geometric phase are briefly summarized, from nematic&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated transmissive to chiral&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated broadband reflective planar optics. Numerous spin&#8208;controlled functionalities are presented, including not only conventional beam steering and focusing, but also advanced light structuring. A comprehensive understanding of LC&#8208;based geometric phase planar optics and their numerous applications is provided.








Abstract
Planar optical elements that can manipulate the multidimensional physical parameters of light efficiently and compactly are highly sought after in modern optics and nanophotonics. In recent years, the geometric phase, induced by the photonic spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has attracted extensive attention for planar optics due to its powerful beam shaping capability. The geometric phase can usually be generated via inhomogeneous anisotropic materials, among which liquid crystals (LCs) have been a focus. Their pronounced optical properties and controllable and stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior introduce new possibilities for LCs beyond traditional panel displays. Recent advances in LC&#8208;mediated geometric phase planar optics are briefly reviewed. First, several recently developed photopatterning techniques are presented, enabling the accurate fabrication of complicated LC microstructures. Subsequently, nematic LC&#8208;based transmissive planar optical elements and chiral LC&#8208;based broadband reflective elements are reviewed systematically. Versatile functionalities are revealed, from conventional beam steering and focusing, to advanced structuring. Combining the geometric phase with structured LC materials offers a satisfactory platform for planar optics with desired functionalities and drastically extends exceptional applications of ordered soft matter. Some prospects on this rapidly advancing field are also provided.

      <title>Plasmonic Microspheres: Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 2001384, Shin&#8208;Hyun Kim and co&#8208;workers design plasmonic Janus microspheres using emulsion drops whose interface is decorated by particles. The emulsion drops made of acrylate resin are photopolymerized and the particles are removed. The directional deposition of the metal renders the top hemispheres as plasmonically colored and the position of the particles at the interface is precisely controlled by aging, which enables the tuning of the plasmonic property. The plasmonic colors can be switched on and off by controlling the orientation of the Janus microspheres with an external electric field.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020013602001360&lt;/a&gt;, Jwa&#8208;Min Nam and co&#8208;workers report a lipid&#8208;nanopillar&#8208;array&#8208;based immunosorbent assay (LNAIA) for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viruses. LNAIA is based on fluid fluorophore&#8208;labeled antibodies on lipid&#8208;modified nanopillar array structures, and it enables reliable quantification of H1N1 virus targets down to 150 viruses within 25 min on a conventional fluorescence microscopy setup.

      <title>Water Splitting: In Situ Formation of Oxygen Vacancies Achieving Near&#8208;Complete Charge Separation in Planar BiVO4 Photoanodes (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001385, Lianzhou Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a planar BiVO4 photoanode with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. They reveal that, under AM 1.5 G illumination, oxygen vacancies increase the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to an excellent applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.76%.

      <title>Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings: Multifunctional Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings for Perishable Fruits (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 1908291, Muhammad M. Rahman, Pulickel M. Ajayan, and co&#8208;workers present a conformal bio&#8208;nanocomposite coating based on cellulose nanocrystals and poly(albumen) that increases the shelf&#8208;life of fresh produce by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial attack. The coating is edible, easily washable, and made from readily available inexpensive materials, which makes it a promising solution to combat food wastage.

      <title>Charge Transport: Photomodulation of Charge Transport in All&#8208;Semiconducting 2D&#8211;1D van der Waals Heterostructures with Suppressed Persistent Photoconductivity Effect (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001268, Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of all&#8208;semiconducting mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer 2D MoS2 and bottom&#8208;up synthesized 1D graphene nanoribbons, which efficiently suppress the typical persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2. Upon interfacing with physisorbed photochromic molecules, the charge transport of MoS2&#8211;graphene nanoribbons in field&#8208;effect transistors can be significantly photomodulated, which corresponds to multilevel output currents for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.
