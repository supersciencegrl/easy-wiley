         <title>A Wireless Hydrogel Thermotherapy System with Adhesion&#8208;Customizable Interfaces for Accelerating Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireless hydrogel thermotherapy system with adhesion&#8208;customizable interfaces is developed for accelerating wound healing. This hydrogel device enables strong adhesion for rapid wound positioning during thermotherapy, maintaining gentle adhesion for conformal contact to avoid wound stress concentration and ensure uniform heating, while realizing low adhesion for benign post&#8208;therapy disassembly without wound damage. Animal experiments confirm that the thermotherapy via hydrogel systems markedly promotes wound healing.








Abstract
Thermotherapy has demonstrated considerable potential in accelerating wound healing by promoting cellular repair and blood circulation. However, existing systems demonstrate nonadjustable adhesion, poor thermal uniformity, etc., substantially hindering widespread applications. Here, a wireless thermotherapy system with adhesion&#8208;customizable hydrogel interfaces is developed for accelerating wound healing. The hydrogel layer exhibits ultra&#8208;low modulus (0.29&#160;kPa) and superior adhesion (15.58&#160;kPa) with wide&#8208;range regulation capability (&gt;8&#8208;folds). Flexible heating layers with anisotropic serpentine&#8208;mesh structures are further prepared, demonstrating high transparency (87.73%) and low resistance (3.83 &#937;) for uniform heating. By integrating hydrogel patches with wireless circuits, a hydrogel thermotherapy system is fabricated for high&#8208;precision closed&#8208;loop temperature control (accuracy: &#177;0.1&#160;&#176;C). Animal experiments show that this system enables strong adhesion for rapid wound positioning during thermotherapy, maintaining gentle adhesion for conformal contact to avoid wound stress concentration and ensure uniform heating, while realizing low adhesion for benign post&#8208;therapy disassembly without wound damage. The wound healing rates reach 99.58% on day 14, which is 15% higher than that in the control group, along with a &#8776;4&#8208;day reduction in healing time. Histopathological analysis further validates the effectiveness of this system in accelerating wound healing. The wireless hydrogel thermotherapy system represents a promising platform for wound management.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Encapsulated FeNi3 in Wood&#8208;Derived N&#8208;Doped CNTs Arrays for Efficient and Stable AEM Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, self&#8208;standing, and sustainable electrocatalyst that integrates tip&#8208;encapsulated FeNi3 alloys in N&#8208;doped CNTs arrays with 3D low&#8208;tortuosity porous structure of delignified wood carbon (FeNi3&#8208;NCNTs@DWC) is demonstrated to achieve efficient and stable natural seawater electrolysis for &gt;2000&#160;h at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 (decay rate &lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&#8722;1).








Abstract
While anion exchange membrane seawater electrolysis (AEMSE) is a promising green hydrogen generation technology, its industrial implementation remains hindered by the lack of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, an innovative electrocatalyst featuring tip&#8208;encapsulated FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes arrays in situ grown on delignified wood carbon (FeNi3&#8208;NCNTs@DWC), integrating tip effect&#8208;induced electron metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) with structural advantages of wood&#8208;based carbon is reported. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong EMSI between FeNi3 alloys and NCNTs@DWC optimizes the interfacial electron configuration and reduces the reaction barrier, thereby enhancing activity and stability. Notably, the dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer formed by the tip effect and Ni(Fe)OOH species inhibits Cl&#8722;, while selectively adsorbing OH&#8722;. Consequently, when integrated into an AEMSE cell, it delivers impressive industrial&#8208;level performance, achieving a cell voltage of 1.88&#160;V at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 with over 2000&#160;h durability (decay rate &lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&#8722;1) in alkaline natural seawater. This corresponds to a 98% electrolysis efficiency, an energy consumption of 49.4&#160;kWh kg&#8722;1 H2, and a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 19.6%. This strategy advances AEMSE toward practical implementation by coupling the tip effect with wood&#8208;derived structural engineering, thereby achieving high activity, selectivity, and long&#8208;term operational stability.

         <title>Lithographically Controlled Liquid Metal Diffusion in Graphene: Fabrication and Magnetotransport Signatures of Superconductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithography&#8208;guided intercalation creates a proximitized 2D superconducting Ga layer under graphene Hall bars via liquid&#8208;metal intercalation. The image shows a Hall bar where Ga atoms from the liquid phase enter through patterned intercalation channels beneath quasi&#8208;freestanding bilayer graphene, forming a confined 2D metal that demonstrates superconductivity near 3.5 K and suppresses the quantum Hall effect in the intercalated graphene.








Abstract
Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity&#8208;induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing&#8208;induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, a lithographically controlled intercalation approach is introduced that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium&#8208;intercalated quasi&#8208;freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magnetotransport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tconset$T_c^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$&#8776; 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric&#8208;in&#8208;field component of non&#8208;uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Melt Spinning Preparation of Conductive, Elastic, and Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Covalently Cross&#8208;Linked Fibers for Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked polyurethane conductive fibers prepared by melt spinning are developed, which have excellent high temperature and solvent resistance. As a negative dielectric material, it can significantly enhance the output signal of triboelectric nanogenerators. These properties make it promising for a wide range of applications in robotics, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Elastic conductive fibers, owing to their flexibility, breathability, and integrability, are essential for smart textiles. While traditional covalently cross&#8208;linked fibers offer excellent performance, their high viscosity limits melt processing and impedes effective composite formation with conductive fillers. Currently, melt spinning technology based on dynamic covalent bonds remains in its infancy, and no studies have reported the successful fabrication of covalently cross&#8208;linked electronic conductive fibers using this technique. To this end, a covalently cross&#8208;linked polyurethane is developed that exhibits both high performance and excellent reprocessability. During the reprocessing, the small molecule cross&#8208;linker is released from the cross&#8208;linked network, which weakens the non&#8208;covalent interaction between linear molecular chains, playing a key role in plasticization and viscosity reduction. The synthesized polyurethane and conductive filler formed a homogeneous composite system, which is used to produce elastic conductive fibers through melt spinning. The resulting conductive fibers exhibited high tensile strength (7.8&#160;MPa), stretchability (53.5 %), high&#8208;temperature resistance (200 &#176;C), and solvent resistance. The fabricated fibers are integrated into a harsh condition&#8208;tolerant triboelectric nanogenerator and used for information transmission. Conductive fibers with negative dielectric constant properties enhanced signal output tenfold due to their unique polarization behavior, offering a new approach for constructing advanced triboelectric nanogenerators.

         <title>Salt Ice VI as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transition in lithium salt solutions that forms an ionically conductive solid&#8208;state phase, salt ice VI. The resulting high&#8208;pressure electrolyte exhibits promising ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. These findings establish high&#8208;pressure phase engineering as an effective route for designing next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes beyond conventional chemical strategies.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are the decisive component of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), determining both safety and energy density. Instead of pursuing new SSEs via various synthetic methods and ever more complex chemical compositions, here a physical&#8208;phase strategy is proposed: convert simple liquid electrolytes into high&#8208;performance SSEs through pressure&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;solid transitions. Using lithium&#8208;salt aqueous solutions as a model system, the pressure&#8208;induced structural evolution is tracked in situ, and discovered that a conductive salt ice VI emerges reproducibly between 1.3 and 2.5 GPa. In situ high&#8208;pressure electrochemical measurements reveal room&#8208;temperature Li+ conductivities of 10&#8722;4&#8211;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, an activation energy of 0.87 eV, and an electrochemical stability window widens to 3.8 V. Density&#8208;functional calculations and a constructed pressure&#8208;temperature phase diagram further elucidate the favorable migration pathways and robust phase stability of salt ice VI. These findings establish pressure&#8208;phase engineering as a powerful, chemistry&#8208;agnostic route for rapidly discovering next&#8208;generation SSEs beyond traditional synthetic paradigms.

Programmable Orientation of Gel Networks
In the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202505268), Tomohiro Takahashi, Naoya Karasawa, and Koki Sano report that the intentional introduction of a gel&#8208;gel interface within a hydrogel induces spontaneous orientation of polymer networks near the interface. By employing a photo&#8208;patterned gel&#8208;gel interface, anisotropic hydrogels with programmable polymer orientations can be successfully synthesized. This study proposes a new concept of gel&#8208;gel interface engineering for the development of next&#8208;generation hydrogels with designable structural complexity.

Microwave&#8208;Driven Vapor Phase Diffusion
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506905), Kang Taek Lee and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a microwave&#8208;driven vapor phase diffusion sintering strategy enabling viscous&#8208;flow&#8208;mediated densification of proton&#8208;conducting perovskite electrolytes at 980 &#176;C. Suppressing Ba volatilization and preserving stoichiometry, this low&#8208;temperature approach overcomes long&#8208;standing fabrication challenges, delivering record&#8208;breaking PCEC performance, refined electrode microstructure, and exceptional durability.

Tunable Structural Color
This cover depicts direct laser writing, using 2 photon polymerisation, of self&#8208;assembled nanocomposite materials. Using fabrication parameters, Larisa Florea, Colm Delaney, and co&#8208;workers are able to finely tune the interparticle spacing. They exploit this to generate wide gamut reflected color in the aqueous state and employ it in stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers for responsive color changes. More details can be found the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202504116).

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D temperature sensing has recently advanced rapidly for comprehensive thermal characterization. In this review, representative research progress is summarized in systems with typical thermal sensing materials and their applications for 3D temperature sensing. The systems include optical&#8208;based and non&#8208;optical&#8208;based systems for surface and volumetric 3D temperature sensing. Challenges and future outlooks are also discussed in the end.








Abstract
Temperature sensing has broad applications in everyday life and serves as a crucial tool for ensuring safety, efficiency, and sustainable development across various industries. Recently, 3D temperature sensing has become increasingly vital in modern society due to the boosted demand for comprehensive thermal information in various applications. This field has attracted global efforts in developing temperature&#8208;sensitive materials, spatial positioning technologies, and new mechanisms of heat transfer to improve temperature resolution and spatial resolution in various systems. This review summarizes representative research progress of thermal sensing materials and systems in 3D temperature sensing. The systems include optical&#8208;based systems (X&#8208;ray computed tomography, luminescence thermometry, optical tomography, Raman spectroscopy, infrared thermography, photoacoustic thermometry) and non&#8208;optical&#8208;based systems (thermocouple, scanning thermal microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic particle imaging). Emphases are placed on introducing the thermal sensing materials, the mechanism of temperature sensing in 3D, and discussing the feasibility of different applications. Artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced 3D temperature sensing is also summarized. Perspectives on current challenges and future research directions are discussed at the end. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further in&#8208;depth research in materials and systems for 3D temperature sensing and help accelerate the growth of this emerging field.

         <title>Loss and Recovery of Effective Lithium in Anode&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging progress in anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (AFSSLMBs) is systematically reviewed from the novel angle of effective Li loss and recovery, in which the effective Li loss is defined as &#8220;irreversible Li loss + sluggish Li kinetics&#8221;. Five component&#8208;level strategies for Li recovery are analyzed, followed by a discussion of future challenges from mechanisms to practical implementation.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (AFSSLMBs), with anticipated high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety, and simplicity of fabrication, are considered to have great potential in becoming promising alternatives for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Unfortunately, the inefficiency of Li plating/stripping and the rapid capacity decay during cycling have severely hindered the further development of AFSSLMBs. Accordingly, to cope with these faced challenges, enormous efforts have been made in the most recent years. However, a comprehensive review entirely focusing on AFSSLMBs seems not available in terms of the loss and recovery of effective Li. Herein, based on the current understanding of AFSSLMBs, the essential causes of the main challenges faced by AFSSLMBs are attributed to irreversible Li loss and sluggish Li kinetics. Subsequently, five main types of advanced strategies for promoting AFSSLMBs&#8217; performance from various critical components are categorized and summarized along with the main line of avoiding effective Li loss, in which the contents from impactful articles published in the most recent one to two years are predominantly comprised. Finally, the challenges and possible future directions of AFSSLMBs are proposed, aiming to accelerate the rapid research and development for practical applications and commercialization of this advanced technology.

         <dc:description>
Space RC materials face unique orbital challenges, including extreme temperature fluctuations, dust deposition, VUV radiation, and AO erosion. This review distinguishes space RC from terrestrial RC and highlights recent advances for effective thermal control. It further emphasizes space RC material degradation and protection under harsh conditions, offering critical insights for spacecraft thermal management and future material innovation.








Abstract
Effective thermal control is critical for the safe operation of spacecraft in the harsh environment of outer space. Radiative cooling (RC), an advanced passive thermal management technology, enables spontaneous heat dissipation via infrared radiation into the ultracold cosmic background. It offers an energy&#8208;efficient solution for maintaining temperature stability without power input. While RC materials have demonstrated promising potential in space applications, a systematic review focusing specifically on their performance and adaptability in space environments remains lacking. To fill this gap, this review first clarifies the fundamental and material&#8208;requirement differences between terrestrial and space&#8208;based RC. Next, it focuses on the space environmental effects on RC materials and their protection strategies, including extreme temperature fluctuations, space dust deposition, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation, and atomic oxygen (AO) erosion. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation RC materials for integrated spacecraft thermal control. This work provides valuable insights into advancing RC technologies, with implications for improving energy efficiency, extending mission lifespans, and enhancing system reliability in future space exploration.

Corneal neovascularization (CoNV) causes significant visual impairment. Advances in nanomaterials offer promising CoNV treatments. This review categorizes different drug delivery systems, summarizes effective treatment strategies, and highlights recent nanotherapy innovations. By analyzing ocular barriers and neovascularization mechanisms, it identifies key biological factors, regulatory pathways, and challenges in ophthalmology, emphasizing nanomaterials' potential to transform CoNV treatment and advance precision medicine.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CoNV) is a major global contributor to visual impairment, significantly affecting patients' vision and overall quality of life. Traditional treatment modalities often prove inadequate, constrained by limited bioavailability, and their extended use may result in serious complications, including secondary infections, glaucoma, and cataracts. However, recent progress in nanomaterials has led to promising therapeutic approaches for CoNV therapy. These nanomaterials, serving as carriers for anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) drugs or corticosteroids, exhibit remarkable capabilities in efficient penetration, adhesion, targeted drug delivery, and controlled release. Furthermore, they demonstrate independent inhibitory effects on neovascularization, thereby paving the way for a comprehensive treatment strategy that encompasses both the microenvironment and molecular pathways. This review offers a systematic classification of innovative drug delivery systems specifically tailored for the cornea. It provides an overview of effective strategies and compiles the latest advancements in cutting&#8208;edge nanotherapy technologies for CoNV. By delving into the intricacies of ocular barriers and neovascularization mechanisms, this review elucidates crucial biological factors and regulatory pathways, highlights the prevalent challenges in ophthalmic medicine, and underscores the significant potential of nanomaterials in revolutionizing CoNV treatment. This in&#8208;depth analysis establishes a scientific foundation for precision medicine and clinical transformation in the field of CoNV.

Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities. Over the past decade, a steadily growing body of research on polyphenol oxidase&#8208;like (PPO&#8208;like) nanozymes, a subgroup of oxidase&#8208;like nanozymes, has suggested their increasing prominence in nanozymology. Most importantly, PPO&#8208;like nanozymes have developed a unique, well&#8208;defined, and systematic design philosophy along with a corresponding catalytic mechanism. In this context, for the first time, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current research status of PPO&#8208;like nanozymes, including a systematic summary of their classification, activity modulation, catalytic mechanisms, and interdisciplinary applications. The review subsequently presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of its biomedical prospects, including in vivo safety, therapeutic mechanisms, targeting capabilities, scalability, reproducibility, and regulatory barriers, to help overcome the obstacles to its clinical translation. By drawing insights from natural enzymes, the unique advantages and future potential of PPO&#8208;like nanozymes in biomedical treatment are examined, aiming to explore this promising field further. Finally, a data&#8208;driven approach is employed to offer insights for the rational design of PPO&#8208;like nanozymes, along with a comprehensive outlook on their current challenges and prospects to promote continued advancement. It is hoped that this review offers valuable insights into the development of PPO&#8208;like nanozymes and promote their translation into the biomedical field.

         <title>Controllable Configuration of Constitutional Units in Vanadium/Iron&#8208;Based Polyanionic Compounds for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes. Herein, the effects of octahedral/tetrahedral constitutional unit characteristics on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between doping and Na&#8208;storage are systematically re&#8208;evaluated, with descriptors established for cross&#8208;material studies. Additionally, by proposing novel configuration compositions, controlling the arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface/microstructure adjustments and theoretical simulations, to achieve multiscale optimization of polyanionic compounds.









Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered&#160;one&#160;of&#160;the&#160;most&#160;promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions. Among&#160;various electrode materials, vanadium/iron&#8208;based polyanionic compounds show significant potential as SIB cathodes due to their stable structures and high operating voltages, yet challenges persist in electron/Na+ transport and energy density. Although doping is an effective solution, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between dopant&#8208;induced configuration of octahedral/tetrahedral units and electrochemical performance remains poorly understood. Herein, the effects of composition and connection type of octahedral and tetrahedral constitutional units on Na&#8208;storage properties are systematically re&#8208;evaluated. By establishing descriptors and systematic analysis, the regulatory roles of octahedral/tetrahedral units are elucidated, establishing a fresh research perspective to describe the intrinsic impact of doping types on the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Additionally, other modification strategies are discussed to complement the research on the constitutional unit. In industrial applications, balancing electrochemical performance with air stability, cost, and large&#8208;scale production remains challenging, creating novel configuration compositions, controlling the structural arrangement of constitutional units, combined with interface and microstructural adjustments, are proposed to achieve multiscale modifications. Simultaneously, theoretical simulations will be employed to predict/validate their efficacy, providing insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost polyanionic compounds for sustainable SIBs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Crystalline Mesoporous Materials: Synthesis Principle and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the significant functional porous materials, multi&#8208;component crystalline mesoporous materials (MCMM) have gradually attracted extensive attention. The development process of MCMM is summarized, focusing on the synthetic principles, formation mechanisms of porous structure, advanced applications, and the structure&#8208;function relationship between porous structure and performance of MCMM. Future challenges and development opportunities for MCMM are also proposed.








Abstract
Owing to the interpenetrating mesopores, tunable pore sizes, high surface areas, and abundant compositions, mesoporous materials have achieved great achievement in applications of energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, and life science. Recently, multi&#8208;component crystalline mesoporous materials (MCMM) have gradually attracted extensive attention due to their defect&#8208;rich porous wall, flexible multi&#8208;components, stable crystal structure, adjustable physicochemical properties, and promising applications. Limited by their complicated multi&#8208;component system and harsh crystallization conditions, it is indeed challenging to synthesize MCMM and lacks systemic guiding principles. In turn, it is a pivotal direction to achieve breakthroughs and promote the development of functional mesoporous materials, because the porous engineering affords a tremendous scope for tailoring the structure and application of MCMM. Profiting from the development of synthetic chemistry and inorganic&#8211;organic self&#8208;assembly chemistry, the controlled synthesis of MCMM have obtained some significant achievements in the past decades. This review summarizes the development of MCMM with an emphasis on synthetic principles and strategies, formation mechanisms of mesoporous structure, advanced applications (particularly in energy storage and conversion, catalysis), and the structure&#8211;function relationship between porous structure and performances of MCMM. Finally, the challenges, possible development directions, and opportunities for MCMM are proposed for the future.

         <title>Nonlocal Metasurface Lens for Long&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circular&#8208;polarization&#8208;selective nonlocal metalens based on a germanium thin film on zinc&#8208;selenide substrate is demonstrated, operating in the long&#8208;wave mid&#8208;infrared range, and based on a square lattice with highly isotropic dispersion, supporting a resonant geometric phase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of complex metasurface operations.








Abstract
Dielectric metasurfaces are structured thin films with a thickness smaller than the operating wavelength aiming at replacing and enhancing conventional bulk optical components. At visible and near&#8208;infrared frequencies, titania or silicon is routinely used as substrates to realize these ultrathin devices by structuring local resonances across an aperture. Unfortunately, directly scaling the same design and material approaches to long&#8208;wave infrared frequencies is unpractical, due to the resulting thickness and the presence of phonon absorption lines. Nonlocal metasurfaces based on extended resonances with a local geometric phase provide a compelling design platform that can address these challenges, they enable ultrathin metasurfaces and offer multi&#8208;functionalities, polarization&#8208; and frequency&#8208;selectivity, and can be implemented in several low&#8208;loss material platforms. Here, nonlocal metalenses are demonstrated based on germanium thin films on a zinc&#8208;selenide substrate, operating at &#8776;10.3&#181;m within a deeply subwavelength device thickness of 1.45&#181;m (14% the free&#8208;space wavelength). A novel meta&#8208;unit geometry is showcased based on a square lattice with highly isotropic dispersion features, supporting a resonant geometric phase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of complex metasurface operations. The introduced platform promises multi&#8208;functional, low&#8208;profile meta&#8208;optics with enhanced meta&#8208;unit designs, compatible with the challenging thermal spectral region for imaging and sensing applications.

         <title>Impact of Strain in Free&#8208;Standing PtSe2 in Scalable 2D MEMS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain tuning of 2D materials such as PtSe2 opens new opportunities for micro&#8208; and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). This study introduces a fabrication method for free&#8208;standing, as&#8208;grown thin&#8208;film channels that bypass mechanical transfer, offering a scalable, universal platform for strain engineering. Optical and electrical characterization, combined with finite&#8208;element simulations, reveals how polycrystallinity influences the strain&#8208;dependent properties of large&#8208;scale&#8208;grown 2D materials.








Abstract
2D layered materials such as PtSe2 are prime candidates for next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electro&#8211;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), including piezoresistive sensors. However, due to difficulties in large&#8208;scale synthesis and the inherent drawbacks associated with mechanical transfer of 2D material films, scalable NEMS production remains challenging. In this work, we report a fabrication route for free&#8208;standing, as&#8208;grown 2D material channels of PtSe2 with controlled dimensions, avoiding a mechanical film transfer. The free&#8208;standing devices provide a universal platform for strain engineering of 2D materials because tension can be easily controlled by application of a back&#8208;contact voltage. Moreover, the piezoresistivity of PtSe2, together with the possibility of wafer&#8208;scale synthesis at back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible growth temperatures, make it ideally suited for scalable incorporation into integrated circuits. Our measurements show that the material properties can be tuned via strain, which offers pathways for classically non&#8208;gateable materials in electronic and photonic devices. Finite element simulations of representative free&#8208;standing films elucidate the nano&#8211;mechanical properties of large&#8208;scale&#8208;grown, polycrystalline 2D materials under tensile strain and demonstrate the influence of polycrystallinity on the optical and electrical behavior.

         <title>Intermediate&#8208;States Mediated 2D MoO3&#8208;x Plasmon Enabling Pure&#8208;Phased CsPbX3 Photovoltaics with 27.33% Bifacial Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This remarkable work combines supercritical CO2 chemical engineering, two&#8208;dimension plasmon photophysical science, and perovskite photovoltaic technology. It introduces novel concepts like broad &#8208; spectrum coupled photon absorption, the intermediate &#8208; localized &#8208; states model, and optoelectrical &#8208; bimodal &#8208; coupling engineering. It aims to combat optoelectronic dissipation and enhance energy harvesting via a heterodimensional van der Waals optically coupled system.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites emerged as a crucial material for addressing the stability bottleneck due to their exceptional resistance to both light&#8208;thermal stress. However, their performance is limited by adverse optoelectronic dissipation arising from inadequate photon conversion and chaotic carrier energetics. Herein, the mechanism of the unique nonlinear plasmonic effect in van der Waals 2D MoO3&#8208;x is elucidated, which is mediated by electronic intermediate states. It demonstrates that the 2D MoO3&#8208;x serves as a light&#8208;capture&#8208;antenna in heterodimensional CsPbX3&#8208;MoO3&#8208;x optically coupled system, contributing to the accumulation the optical field energy on the nanoscale and resulting in a remarkable 59% increase in photon convergence. Additionally, facet&#8208;oriented carrier channels can be established through heteroepitaxy along matched Mo&#8208;O octahedron. This optoelectrical&#8208;bimodal&#8208;coupling engineering combined with a bifacial light&#8208;harvesting configuration yields a bifacial equivalent efficiency of 27.33%, which stands as the supreme performance in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Van der Waals Integration of 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 and 2D WSe2 for Gate&#8208;Tunable In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed&#160;self&#8208;powered photodetectors for in&#8208;sensor image processing by integrating high&#8208;quality 1D Nb2Pd3Se8 with 2D WSe2. The type&#8208;I junction and a 1D van der Waals interfaceenable gate&#8208;tunable switching between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, yieldingbroadband bi&#8208;directional photoresponse. The devices achieve high responsivity, fast response, and efficient high&#8208;energy photon collection.








Abstract
1D and 2D integrations provide significant promise for machine vision by enabling compact, power&#8208;efficient&#160;optoelectronic devices. However, the potential of 1D materials in mixed&#8208;dimensional structures for convolutional image processing remains largely unexplored. Here, high&#8208;quality 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8 is synthesized and integrated with&#160;2D&#8208;WSe2 to form self&#8208;powered photodetectors, exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable bi&#8208;directional photoresponse for image processing. Utilizing the narrow band gap and favorable work function of 1D&#8208;Nb2Pd3Se8, a type&#8208;I junction and 1D van der Waals interface are established with transition metal dichalcogenides. The gate tunable built&#8208;in electric field enables switching&#160;between n&#8208;p and n&#8208;n+ configurations, allowing the drift photocurrent direction to be reversed, achieving both negative and positive photocurrent. Furthermore, efficient conversion of high&#8208;energy photons along one dimension enhances sensitivity at 375&#160;nm. The device achieves a responsivity of 232&#160;mA W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 77% at 375 nm illumination, rapid response time of ~3 &#181;s, detectivity of 6.35 &#215; 1010 Jones, and broadband photodetection from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. The demonstrated gate&#8208;controllable, bi&#8208;directional photoresponse with linear power dependence in a 1D heterojunction offers a promising platform for&#160;in&#8208;sensor convolutional processing with high integration and portability.

The demonstrated gate-controllable, bi-directional photoresponse with linear power dependence in a 1D heterojunction offers a promising platform for&#160;in-sensor convolutional processing with high integration and portability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Architected Soft Actuators for Artificial Musculoskeletal Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An architected soft actuator uses a servo motor and a combination of 3D printed architected elastomers to extend and contract. The actuator exhibits high actuation stroke, force output, and power density for constructing bioinspired artificial musculoskeletal systems. Human&#8208;scale legs with bone&#8208;inspired links, tendons, and three architected soft actuators as artificial muscles can kick and operate continuously on portable battery supplies.








Abstract
Vertebrates depend on their musculoskeletal system for locomotion, manipulation, interaction with their environment, and more. The robustness and efficiency of animal locomotion are difficult to achieve in robots because their hardware does not replicate the mechanics and performance of animal bodies. Moreover, many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft actuators are ill&#8208;suited as muscles in artificial musculoskeletal systems for deployable, task&#8208;capable robots. This study presents an electrically&#8208;driven, architected soft actuator that can be assembled into artificial musculoskeletal systems. The fully 3D printed actuators linearly extend and contract through the rotation of an integrated servo motor. They comprise a thermoplastic polyurethane handed shearing auxetic (HSA) and origami bellows structure. Together, these structures transmit torque, stretch, and resist torsional deflection in a manner that produces large linear actuation and force output up to 59 mm (or 30% strain) and 75 N, respectively. It showcases the actuator's performance as artificial muscles in a battery&#8208;powered, human&#8208;scale leg that can use three muscles to kick a ball. When accounting for the weight of auxiliary hardware, the actuators exhibit power and energy densities that are four orders of magnitude higher than for leading soft artificial muscles. The soft actuators represent a step toward providing robots with bioinspired musculoskeletal systems for animal&#8208;like abilities.

This study synthesized innovative UV&#8208;responsive polyurethanes (NPE&#8208;PUs) containing azobenzene units and ionic liquid units, based on nanophotoelectric effect. The generators (NPEGs) from NPE&#8208;PUs rapidly yielded 36.57 V electrical signals under UV light. A 9 &#215; 9 matrix of 81 NPEGs, mimicking human vision, achieved 96.22% accuracy in item identification. This comprehensive system advances bionic visual recognition and artificial intelligence fields.








Abstract
Artificial photoreceptors utilizing piezoelectric polymers and semiconductors can convert external mechanical deformations, forces, or changes in light into electrical signals, making them essential for advanced optoelectronic sensors and smart wearable devices. However, this approach faces several challenges, including slow response time, weak signal, and high power consumption. This study synthesizes a series of polyurethanes containing azobenzene&#8208;based photoisomer units and ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based dipole units (comprising loose cation&#8211;anion pairs) based on the nanophotoelectric effect, wherein ultraviolet light induces isomerization of photoisomer segments and generates dynamic dipoles, creating equal amounts of charges with opposite signs at the electrodes. The nanophotoelectric generator achieves open&#8208;circuit voltage of 37 V, short&#8208;circuit current of 265 &#181;A, and rapid response time of 7.5 &#181;s under UV illumination. Furthermore, 81 individual nanophotoelectric generators are integrated into a 9 &#215; 9 pixel array for a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted system to accurately (96.22%) recognize different items, like human vision; it simultaneously executes super&#8208;resolution refinement on the acquired pixel images, further improving the identification results. Precise, efficient intelligent object recognition is thus attained through material innovation, and a comprehensive system is established that encompasses azobenzene&#8211;ionic&#8208;liquid copolymer preparation, device assembly, integration, signal acquisition, and machine learning, offering novel insights into bionic visual recognition systems.

         <title>Additive with Multinary Interactions to Perovskite Precursor Species for Catalyzed Crystallization of Antisolvent&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel additive, parecoxib (Pr), is presented to catalyze &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystallization in the antisolvent&#8208;free processes via multinary interactions to the precursor species. This measure provides effective regulation of perovskite crytallization, suppression of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, and passivation of grain boundaries. The as&#8208;made Cs&#8208;free FAPbI3 solar cell reaches a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.38%.








Abstract
Antisolvent&#8208;free processes exhibit numerous advantages for fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) while requiring exquisite control of nucleation and crystallization of perovskite film. Without the addition of Cs and Br species, more obstacles are faced for the preferred &#945;&#8208;phase pure formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. In this work, a novel additive, parecoxib (Pr), is proposed, which catalyzes the direct crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 through multinary interactions with the solvate perovskite precursor. Detailed molecular interactions and in situ analysis reveal that Pr provides nucleation sites, reduces the grain growth rate, suppresses the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, and ultimately enhances the quality of the perovskite film. Furthermore, Pr can in situ passivate the grain boundaries, reduce nonradiative recombination, and enhance open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.195&#160;V. As a result, high&#8208;performance antisolvent&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCs are achieved with the PCE reaching 25.38% and 19.64% for mini&#8208;modules (93&#160;cm2). The unencapsulated device maintains 91.08% of the initial PCE for 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C, and 90.62% after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Self&#8208;Stratifying Colored Radiative Cooling Paints Through Narrow&#8208;Band Color Preservation Scheme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an easy&#8208;fabrication and self&#8208;stratifying paint recipe that forms an absorptionscattering dual&#8208;layer structure, systematically preserving color while enabling subambient daytime radiative cooling. All colored paints exhibit outstanding subambient cooling potential (&gt;90% solar refletance and 0.94 sky window emissivity), and the coolest black paint achieves exceptionally high solar reflectance (&#8764;46%).








Abstract
Although significant energy&#8208;saving potential of passive daytime radiative cooling has led to diffusively white or reflective surfaces, achieving coloration expands their application for both aesthetic and functional purposes. However, it presents huge technical challenges in scalable processing. This work presents a novel and general self&#8208;stratifying approach for creating radiative cooling paints with various colors using selected narrow&#8208;band absorption dyes. Applied as a single coat, these paints self&#8208;assemble into an absorption&#8208;scattering dual&#8208;layer structure that efficiently displays color while minimizing light absorption. Three base colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) are demonstrated to provide full daytime subambient cooling, achieving 93% solar reflectance and 0.94 sky window emissivity. One newly developed black paint achieves 46.3% solar reflectance and a temperature drop of up to 25&#160;&#176;C, outperforming commercial counterparts. A purple radiative cooling paint (mixed dyes) demonstrates the color customization potential within the CMYK space, addressing the dilemma between color and cooling for colored radiative cooling paints. The mechanical and surface properties, characterized by abrasion, adhesion, and contact angle tests, are on par with or surpassing commercial products. This unique self&#8208;stratifying mechanism enhances surface properties and provides new insights for developing high&#8208;volume loading paints and water&#8208;harvesting coatings without increasing fabrication complexity.

         <title>2D Molybdenum Disulfide Embedded Photonic Crystal Fiber for all&#8208;Fiber Phase Retarder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;induced birefringence is successfully achieved through selective vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs). The position&#8208;specific MoS2 films efficiently break the degeneracy of polarization modes and enable phase retardation with a manageable beat length. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS2&#8208;PCF phase retarder reliably works in variable conditions, including outdoor exposure, large deformation, and high temperature/humidity.









Abstract
The integration of 2D materials with optical fibers enables multifunctional fiber devices, such as polarizers, modulators, and sensors. Recent advances in direct vapor deposition growth further enhance light&#8208;2D material interactions to centimeter&#8208;scale lengths, overcoming the micrometer&#8208;scale limitations of transferred 2D materials. However, conventional methods for growing 2D materials in fibers typically produce isotropic material architectures due to uniform precursor deposition, limiting applications that require birefringence, such as a phase retarder. Here, a selective vapor deposition method is proposed to realize the non&#8208;circular symmetric growth of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) into photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), achieving anisotropy&#8208;engineered phase retardation. The high refractive index of MoS2 efficiently breaks the degeneracy of polarization modes in PCF and enables phase retardation with a manageable beat length of &#8776;7.7&#160;cm. The MoS2&#8208;PCF phase retarder reliably works in varying conditions, including outdoor exposure, large deformation, and high temperature/humidity. Its phase retardation exhibits an extremely small fluctuation of &#8776;3.3&#176; between 25 and 200&#160;&#176;C, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercial polarization&#8208;maintaining fibers (&#8776;2.0&#176;/&#176;C). The work provides a new solution for the fiber device preparation and pave the way for robust polarization manipulation in all&#8208;fiber systems.

         <title>In Vivo Reprogramming Dysfunctional Retinal Ganglion Cells and Visual&#8208;phototransduction via Wireless Charging Nanogold for Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted wireless charging gold nanoparticles (WCGs) are developed to enhance gene delivery and electrical stimulation for the treatment of LHON. MT&#8208;ND4 transfection is improved, mitochondrial function is restored, and RGC regeneration is promoted both in vitro and in vivo. With HFMF stimulation, M&#252;ller glia are reprogrammed, phototransduction is restored, and visual function is recovered in LHON mouse models.








Abstract
Gene therapy offers a promising treatment for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a disease of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration with severe vision loss caused by mitochondria&#8208;NADH dehydrogenase 4 (MT&#8208;ND4) mutations. However, optimizing mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene delivery to promote RGC regeneration and visual&#8208;photoreception recovery remains challenging in LHON. Here, mitochondria&#8208;targeted wireless charging gold nanoparticles (WCGs), doubling as a wireless charging&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;delivery platform and electric stimulus&#8208;restored phototransduction, are developed for LHON treatment. Upon high&#8208;frequency magnetic field (HFMF) irradiation, WCGs enhanced MT&#8208;ND4 transfection efficiency, restored complex I activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in vitro, and further promoted RGC neurite outgrowth in LHON patient&#8208;derived iPSC&#8208;differentiated retinal organoids. Wireless charging combined with electric stimulation also facilitated in vivo gene delivery, effectively promoting neuronal recovery, preventing RGC degeneration, suppressing inflammation, and enhancing retinal electrophysiological function in the damaged retinas of LHON mice. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing and spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis revealed that HFMF&#8208;treatment reprograms M&#252;ller glia to enhance dendritic development, restore mitochondrial function, and express phototransduction genes to support photoreceptor function in vivo. Finally, functional retinal&#8208;optic&#8208;electrophysiological findings with spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis at the single&#8208;cell level support that HFMF synergized with WCG/hND4 therapy, promoting retinal repairment with RGC neurite regeneration and recovering visual phototransduction in LHON mouse models.

         <title>Gel&#8208;Gel Interface Engineering for the Synthesis of Anisotropic Hydrogels with Designable Polymer Orientations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that when a gel&#8208;gel interface is intentionally introduced into a hydrogel via two&#8208;step polymerization, the polymer networks near the interface spontaneously align perpendicular to it. By employing a photo&#8208;initiator system to spatially control the gel&#8208;gel interface, anisotropic hydrogels with programmable orientations of polymer networks can be synthesized, thereby demonstrating the utility of the gel&#8208;gel interface.








Abstract
Anisotropic hydrogels with designable structural complexity can exhibit sophisticated properties reminiscent of those found in living organisms. However, conventional synthetic methods typically require specific anisotropic additives and complicated processes, limiting design flexibility. Here, a simple and versatile strategy to synthesize anisotropic hydrogels with photo&#8208;designable orientations of polymer networks is developed by harnessing a &#8220;gel&#8208;gel interface,&#8221; which can be generated through the intentional adhesion between hydrogels. This strategy originates from the serendipitous discovery: when a gel&#8208;gel interface is intentionally introduced into a hydrogel through a two&#8208;step polymerization, the polymer networks near the interface are spontaneously aligned perpendicular to the interface, as a result of the simultaneous swelling and fixation process during gel&#8208;to&#8208;gel adhesion. By employing a photo&#8208;initiator system to control the gel&#8208;gel interface, anisotropic hydrogels with both 2D and 3D designed polymer orientations, as well as anisotropic hydrogels with thermally switchable polymer orientations, are successfully synthesized. The gel&#8208;gel interface has long been regarded as merely an undesirable byproduct of gel adhesion, while the complementary bulk region of hydrogels has been the primary focus in constructing anisotropic hydrogels. In contrast, this work demonstrates the utility of the gel&#8208;gel interface, expanding design possibilities for next&#8208;generation hydrogels with designable structural complexity.

         <title>Reversing the Reaction Order Between FA+ and Rb+ Enhances the Photovoltaic Performance of Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) retards Rb+ reaction with the Pb&#8208;I framework, enabling Rb&#8314; occupation at the A&#8208;site cation position. This allows Rb&#8314; to alloy with formamidinium (FA), stabilizing the perovskite lattice and reducing strain. HMP boosts perovskite photovoltaic cell efficiency to a record 25.8% and enhances harsh&#8208;environment stability, offering a novel approach to regulate crystallization kinetics. 








Abstract
Manipulating the kinetics of the reaction between A&#8208;site cations and Pb&#8208;I frameworks holds paramount importance for achieving high&#8208;quality, phase&#8208;homogeneous FA&#8208;dominant perovskites. It has been observed that when rubidium (Rb) serves as an A&#8208;site cation dopant, it tends to accumulate in the bulk region of the perovskite structure due to its pronounced affinity for Pb&#8208;I frameworks compared to FA+. Consequently, Rb+ ions struggle to alleviate the exaggerated tensile strain induced by the bulky FA cations on the perovskite surface. To mitigate this challenge, 5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) is introduced as an additive to invert the sequence between FA+ and Rb+ in reaction with the Pb&#8208;I frameworks. The introduction of HMP effectively stabilizes Rb+ cations within the perovskite lattice, leading to a surface enriched with Rb that exhibits diminished lattice strain and defects. Finally, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% for 0.09 cm2 perovskite solar cells and 19.8% for 52 cm2 mini&#8208;module is achieved, which are fabricated via blade coating under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of &#8804;55%. Notably, these cells exhibit minimal hysteresis and demonstrate significantly enhanced resilience against illumination, dampness, and heat.

         <title>Toposelective Functionalization of Solution&#8208;Processed Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Metal Nanoparticles via Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for toposelective functionalization of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides with noble metal nanoparticles via galvanic displacement. Owing to the selective edge decoration with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, the hybrid materials exhibit new properties and improved device performance in sensing, electrocatalysis, and electronics. This approach exploits a defect engineering strategy to produce multifunctional mixed&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides commonly serve as quintessential 2D substrates and templates to develop hybrid structures with novel and/or enhanced properties and performance. However, the effects and control of their ubiquitous and abundant structural defects are still poorly explored and understood. Here, exploiting their highly reactive and defective edges, an unprecedented strategy is introduced for their toposelective functionalization with noble metal nanoparticles through galvanic displacement. Selectively edge&#8208;decorated transition metal dichalcogenides nanosheets are successfully produced with gold, palladium, or platinum nanoparticles, showing tunable loading and size. As proof of concept, the hybrid systems are tested for optical and photothermal sensing, as well as electrocatalysis and electronics, demonstrating their enhanced functionality and broad applicability. These findings pave the way for the versatile production of mixed&#8208;dimensional multifunctional materials, achieved by harnessing the defective nature of solution&#8208;processed transition metal dichalcogenides via molecular chemistry approaches.

         <title>Role of Precursor Miscibility in Area&#8208;Selective Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how the chemical structure of alumina precursors affects their interaction with benzenethiol inhibitor layers on Cu surfaces during area&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (AS&#8208;ALD). It reveals that ligand&#8208;dependent miscibility and Lewis acidity govern precursor infiltration and degradation of the inhibitor, leading to selectivity loss. The work introduces a new mechanism for selectivity failure in AS&#8208;ALD processes.








Abstract
Area&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (AS&#8208;ALD) is of increasing importance in nanostructure fabrication, and precursor selection is critical to realizing a successful process. This work explores the role of the precursor in achieving AS&#8208;ALD of Al2O3&#160;on a dielectric (SiO2) in the presence of a metal (Cu/CuOx). Four different precursors&#8212;dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI), trimethylaluminum (TMA), triethylaluminum (TEA), and triisobutylaluminum (TIBA)&#8212;are tested against a benzenethiol (BT) inhibitor. BT forms monolayers on Cu, whereas on CuOx&#160;it forms a thick crystalline multilayer composed of 1D&#8208;coordination polymers of Cu&#8208;thiolate (CuBT). This work observes that DMAI provides exceptional selectivity: 22&#160;nm of Al2O3&#160;can be deposited on patterned substrates with 99.9% selectivity, and in the case of thick CuBT can achieve excellent pattern transfer on nanoscale patterns with well&#8208;defined material interfaces. In contrast, none of the alkylaluminum precursors show significant selectivity, a result attributed to their miscibility in the CuBT multilayer leading to its degradation. This work proposes that the miscibility of the alkylaluminum precursors depends on ligand length and structure. The results show that the ligand&#8208;dependent miscibility and subsequent degradation of CuBT impact the location of Al2O3&#160;nucleation. This study&#160;highlights new considerations for AS&#8208;ALD process design to achieve high selectivity.

         <title>Bright Chromium&#8208;Sensitized Lanthanide NIR&#8208;II Mechanoluminescence in a Piezoelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of mechanoluminescent materials are constrained by their limited emission in the NIR and suboptimal luminescence intensity. Herein, a bright NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescent material is developed by co&#8208;doping Cr3+/Ln3+ in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. The nearly complete energy transfer from concentrated Cr3+ to Yb3+ (or Er3+) results in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger mechanoluminescence compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are critical components of high&#8208;performance optical devices for frontier applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, non&#8208;destructive analysis, and deep&#8208;tissue imaging. In this work, a bright Cr3+&#8208;sensitized lanthanide NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence (ML) is developed in piezoelectric &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. Specifically, a nearly complete energy transfer (ET) from highly doped Cr3+ ions to Yb3+ and Er3+ acceptors is observed, resulting in pronounced ML at 1002 and 1542&#160;nm. The NIR&#8208;II luminescence intensity is further improved by cation alloying due to the promotion of octahedral distortion, culminating in 5.9&#8208; and 3.0&#8208;fold stronger ML emissions compared to the well&#8208;established CaZnOS:Yb3+ and CaZnOS:Er3+, respectively. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations revealed that the ML behavior with high dopant concentration is enabled by strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric potential without the involvement of trapping states, thus exhibiting exceptional cycling stability. Finally, an innovative multi&#8208;level encryption framework is established for information protection with wavelength&#8208;selective readout capabilities by optical or mechanical excitation.

         <title>Breaking the Conversion Limit in an Intercalation&#8208;Type Cathode by Loosening Aqueous Cation Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A loose cation coordination environment in dilute aqueous perchlorate electrolyte drives Bi2Se3 from typical intercalation to reversible dual intercalation&#8208;conversion, achieving high capacity, elevated discharge potential, rapid kinetics, and exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability over 20&#8201;000 cycles, offering a new pathway to boost aqueous multivalent battery performance.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type cathodes continue to dominate aqueous multivalent ion storage, despite higher theoretical capacities being available from conversion reactions involving multiple electron transfer. Pushing intercalation&#8208;type cathodes into conversion is certainly desirable, conventionally with great sacrificing cycling&#8208;stability, kinetics, and discharge potential. To date, limited progress has been achieved in overcoming this longstanding and formidable performance trade&#8208;off. Herein, it is demonstrated that by loosening cation coordination in dilute aqueous systems, typical intercalation&#8208;type electrodes (Bi2Se3) can be unexpectedly extended into the conversion regime, yielding a twofold capacity increase of 417.6 mAh g&#8722;1 with an excellent combination of reversible lifespan (20&#8201;000 cycles with a decay rate of 0.013&#8240;), rate capability (314.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and enhanced operating potential. Composited operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction technology, first&#8208;principal calculations, and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with electron microscopy analyses indicated that hydrophobic perchlorate optimizes the solvation coordination and charge transfer of cations, which overall decreases the interfacial reaction barrier and enhances the reaction potential, hence initiating unique reversible and depth intercalation&#8210;conversion mechanisms. Well&#8208;characterized loosening cation coordination further ensures high ion mobility, extraordinary low&#8208;temperature performance, and robust operation in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, offering key insights for improving the energy density of aqueous batteries.

         <title>A Multimodal Sensory Textile Using Programmable Ferroelectric Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional wearable sensors struggle with power efficiency and integration for multimodal sensing. This work presents a wearable sensory textile using programmable ferroelectric nanocomposites that can simultaneously detect mechanical and thermal stimuli. It opens new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance materials and self&#8208;powered multimodal sensors for human&#8211;machine interfaces and virtual reality applications.








Abstract
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, multimodal sensing is becoming increasingly important. However, conventional approaches relying on multiple integrated sensors face significant challenges due to power consumption and miniaturization requirements. In response, a wearable multimodal sensory textile (MST) for simultaneous mechanical and thermal sensing is developed. The MST demonstrates exceptional capabilities for concurrent mechanical and thermal tactile sensing, with a pressure sensitivity of 0.9 V N&#8722;1 and temperature sensitivity of 38.7 pA K&#8722;1. This outstanding sensing performance is attributed to the mechanical and thermal reinforcement of the programmable ferroelectric nanocomposite enabled by topological engineering. By combining phase&#8208;field simulation with experimental characterization, it is revealed that the alignment of ceramic fillers not only promotes spontaneous polarization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane domain fraction under external poling but also establishes bimodal pathways for efficient stress and heat transmission. The programmable arrangement and orientation of ferroelectric oxide fillers, achieved by tuning dielectrophoretic voltage, frequency, and temperature, boost piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses by 114% and 131%, respectively, compared to randomly distributed counterparts. This work offers insights into the underlying mechanism of topological modulation in polymer composites and provides new possibilities for designing high&#8208;performance functional materials for multimodal sensing, as well as self&#8208;powered multimodal sensors for human&#8211;machine interfaces and virtual reality.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time Solar UVA Dose Monitor Based on Recyclable Azobenzene&#8208;Containing Elastomer Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the self&#8208;synthesized main&#8208;chain azobenzene thermoplastic polyurethane (Az&#8208;TPU), a real&#8208;time solar UV dose monitoring device is developed. This device exhibits high performance, recyclability, and strain&#8208;insensitivity, enabling the conversion of solar UVA signals into real&#8208;time signals transmitted via a smartphone application, demonstrating promising potential for broad practical applications.








Abstract
Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a primary cause of skin cancer and erythema, poses irreversible risks to human health, underscoring the urgent need for advanced solar UV detector. Herein, we present a novel intrinsically flexible UVA detector featuring real&#8208;time monitoring, high performance and recyclability. This breakthrough is achieved through engineered oriented composite fabrics combining main&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (Az&#8208;TPU) with piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] nanogenerators. The molecular architecture employs azobenzene groups and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as hard segment, while polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) forms the soft segment. The physical cross&#8208;linking network and homogeneous microphase&#8208;separated structure enables the fabrics to generate substantial internal stress, resulting in superior photoelectrical conversion capabilities. The device we report achieves an 80 ms response time and maintains excellent linear correlation (R2 = 0.997) across a broad light intensity range (0.05&#8211;50 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2). Remarkably, the fabric achieves dynamic UV light monitoring when subjected to a tensile strain of 10%. Integrated with Bluetooth communication, the device enables real&#8208;time data transmission to mobile devices for continuous UVA intensity and dose monitoring throughout daily sunlight exposure. With demonstrated capability for solar UVA measurement, this technology presents significant industrial potential for wearable solar UV monitoring systems.

         <title>Enhancing &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage Cleavage with Ultrahigh Faradaic Efficiency via Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis for Lignin Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic&#8211;chemical strategy enables efficient lignin oxidation under mild alkaline conditions. The Au/CuO&#8208;catalyzed process cleaves &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages via: i) electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;OH dehydrogenation and ii) spontaneous C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; scission. The tailored Au/CuO interface accelerates the critical dehydrogenation step, enhancing overall depolymerization efficiency.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages in lignin has gained prominence as a sustainable strategy for biomass valorization. However, its broader application remains limited by key challenges, such as low Faradaic efficiency (FE), high oxidation potentials, and limited mechanistic understanding. To address these limitations, an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem catalysis system is developed for the electrooxidation of 2&#8208;phenoxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (PPE). Mechanistic investigations revealed a two&#8208;step tandem process in PPE cleavage: i) electrochemical dehydrogenation of the C&#945;&#9472;OH groups, followed by ii) non&#8208;electrochemical C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. The improved cleavage efficiency can be primarily attributed to the accelerated electrocatalytic dehydrogenation step. To optimize the adsorption of OH&#8722; and PPE molecules during electrocatalysis, an Au&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated CuO nanoflakes (Au/CuO) electrocatalyst is designed. Comprehensive characterization techniques demonstrated that Au nanoparticles act as active sites for C&#945;&#9472;OH oxidation, while the CuO substrate facilitates PPE adsorption. Notably, the Au/CuO electrode achieved high product yields of 99.2% phenol and 80.2% benzoic acid at 0.95 VRHE, with a record&#8208;high FE of 74.7% for PPE conversion. Furthermore, the catalytic strategy was successfully extended to the depolymerization of organosolv lignin (OL). This study elucidates an electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem mechanism for the electrocatalytic cleavage of lignin and presents an efficient electrocatalyst with high FE for lignin depolymerization.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical System for Scalable Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Molecularly Engineered Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a molecularly engineered conjugated polycarbazole framework that enables efficient, stable, and bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Scaled to a 1 m2 panel reactor operating under natural sunlight, the system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.10%, setting a new benchmark as the largest and most efficient solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production demonstrated to date.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis emerges as a promising pathway to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reimagining the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. However, scaling PEC systems from laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes to practical large&#8208;area installations remains a significant scientific and engineering challenge, primarily due to limited catalytic selectivity at photoelectrode surfaces and rapid performance degradation during upscaling. This study presents a modular, bias&#8208;free PEC system designed for scalable solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPFs) containing rationally designed diacetylene and anthraquinone moieties functions as molecularly precise catalytic layers, enabling concurrent two&#8208;electron pathways at both the photoanode and photocathode. The resulting photoanode and photocathode deliver faradaic efficiencies of 94.08% and 95.50%, respectively, for H2O2 production. Integrating these photoelectrodes into a 1 cm2 unbiased tandem PEC device achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 2.11%. More importantly, scaling these devices to a 1 m2 membrane&#8208;free PEC panel reactor via a modular assembly strategy yields an average SCC efficiency of 1.10% under natural sunlight, representing the largest reported solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production to date. This study bridges the gap between laboratory&#8208;scale experimentation and real&#8208;world applications, providing a scalable framework for decentralized, solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Pore Engineering in Double&#8208;Layer Textiles for Adaptive Thermal and Moisture Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;TEX textile is developed through an integrated back&#8208;weft weaving and in situ foaming process, creating an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile with a closed&#8208;pore microstructure. This material has low thermal conductivity (0.039 W/(m&#8901;K)), excellent water resistance and moisture transport (one&#8208;way transport index: 1082%; WVT &gt; 4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)), and maintains stable under extreme temperatures (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), deformation, and washing.








Abstract
Protective textiles face a critical challenge in cold and moisture&#8208;rich environments, in which conventional layered clothing systems and multi&#8208;layer functional textiles often sacrifice breathability and comfort to enhance insulation, or conversely, lose body heat with moisture accumulation. Here, back&#8208;weft weaving technology is combined with an in situ foaming process to produce an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile (Foam&#8208;TEX) featuring abundant closed&#8208;pore microspheres on the foamed fibers and gradient pores throughout the textile. The closed&#8208;pore structural engineering spatially couples the closed&#8208;pore insulation unit with the gradient vapor transmission channel to ensure thermal comfort in cold environments, while effectively preventing heat loss caused by the degradation of insulation performance due to sweat in extremely cold working conditions. As a result, the closed&#8208;pore microstructure provides a low thermal conductivity of 0.039 W/(m&#183;K). Meanwhile, the gradient pores create Laplace pressure difference during water diffusion, driving unidirectional moisture transport and achieving excellent one&#8208;way transport index (1082%) and moisture permeability (&gt;4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)). Foam&#8208;TEX also demonstrates excellent stability under alternating extreme temperature conditions (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), washing, and wringing. This approach provides a flexible and scalable platform to extend the capabilities of Foam&#8208;TEX (e.g., Joule heating) to accommodate a variety of extreme wearing scenarios.

         <title>Unveiling Scale&#8208;Design Principle at Electrical Confinement Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a new design paradigm for electrical confinement materials (ECMs) aimed at water purification, utilizing the energy equivalence design principle to achieve optimized reaction kinetics efficacy. This approach provides a scalable strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance ECMs, effectively overcoming the limitations associated with small&#8208;scale material synthesis and enhancing anti&#8208;fouling capabilities in response to environmental disturbances.








Abstract
Electrochemical water treatment is a promising sustainable environmental remediation technology due to its eco&#8208;friendliness, ease of control, and significant effectiveness in degrading organic pollutants. The electrical confinement materials (ECMs) exhibit enhanced mass transfer characteristics that substantially reduce energy consumption and reaction time within the system. In this study, the design strategies of ECMs are evaluated from the perspective of trade&#8208;offs in equivalent energy drives, including pressure&#8208;driven and electric&#8208;driven forms. The reaction efficiency and the potential for interface anti&#8208;fouling are investigated across confined spatial scales. These findings indicate that, in scenarios characterized by the equivalent energy input principle, the ECMs can effectively address the challenges associated with material spatial scale design. This advancement facilitates the achievement of energy equivalence in the water purification process, particularly in addressing significant application challenges related to loading catalytic layers within confined channels. The result on the anti&#8208;fouling potential of ECMs indicates that an interface oxidation mechanism dominated by hydroxyl radicals is more effective in resisting electrode deactivation caused by dissolved natural polymers in the water matrix. This study offers key insights for designing anti&#8208;fouling and energy&#8208;saving interfaces with efficient mass transfer in water treatment, enhancing the potential of electrochemical methods.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Corrosive Covalent Iodo&#8208;Thiadiazole Catalyst Enables Aqueous Zn&#9472;S Batteries with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries, a covalently bonded iodo&#8211;thiadiazole redox mediator suppresses parasitic I3&#8722;&#8208;mediated Zn corrosion and enhances Zn&#8211;S redox kinetics, enabling pouch cell with a high capacity of 1398 mAh g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles. This innovative catalyst design is a leap toward practical and grid&#8208;scale aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (AZSBs) hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but suffer from low Coulombic efficiency (CE) due to sluggish Zn&#9472;S redox kinetics and severe Zn anode corrosion, limiting their cycling life and practical applicability. Although state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iodine&#8208;based redox mediators can accelerate cathode kinetics, they typically result in the formation of free I3&#8722; species, which exacerbate Zn corrosion. Here, we report a covalent iodo&#8211;thiadiazole redox mediator (CIM) as an anti&#8208;corrosive and highly efficient catalyst to achieve high CE in AZSBs. The covalently anchored iodine in CIM effectively suppresses free I3&#8722; formation and mitigates Zn corrosion. More importantly, dynamic electronic restructuring from C5&#9552;N to C5&#9472;N bonds (C5: 5th&#8208;position carbon in the thiadiazole ring) promotes Zn&#8211;S redox kinetics through a &#963;&#8208;coordination electron pathway facilitated by the Zn&#9472;I&#9472;C5 bond. As a result, CIM&#8208;based coin cells achieve an average CE of 99.56% and a capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 after 700 cycles at 8 C. The CIM&#8208;based pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 1398 mAh g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles at 0.8 C. This work presents a practical design strategy for iodine&#8208;based catalysts, enabling next&#8208;generation aqueous metal&#8208;sulfur batteries with enhanced durability and performance.

         <title>Linking Electron Cloud Potential Wells to Achieve Ultrahigh Output Current in a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking the electron cloud potential wells of triboelectric materials could lead to a huge increase in the output current of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This hypothesis was verified by embedding conductive reduced graphene oxide into triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose and polydimethylsiloxane, realizing a record&#8208;high current density of &#8764;3533 mA&#160;m&#8722;2. This TENG also showed excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and rainy environments. 








Abstract
With the development of the Internet of Things and intelligent robots, there is an increasing demand for distributed flexible sensor networks and portable power devices. As a self&#8208;powered sensor and micro/nano powering supplier, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can convert the irregular and ubiquitous mechanical energy into electrical energy demonstrates promising applications in human&#8211;machine interaction, soft robotics, wearable healthcare, etc. However, achieving ultrahigh current density and water resistance in TENGs remains challenging, mainly due to the non&#8208;utilization of the electrons in the interior of triboelectric layers. Herein, it is proposed that linking the electron cloud potential wells (ECPWs) of triboelectric materials can lead to a huge increase in the output current of TENGs. This hypothesis is verified by embedding a conductive network of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the triboelectric layers of ethyl cellulose (EC) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The TENG based on this model demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of &#8776;3533&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 among the TENGs working in contact&#8208;separation mode. In addition, this TENG shows excellent endurance in high&#8208;humidity and even rainy environments. This work provides a novel and promising strategy for fabricating TENGs with ultrahigh output current and water resistance, largely expanding their practical applications in many fields.

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Buried Interface Binding of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Efficient And Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure perovskite solar cells, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) such as [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) exhibit limited buried interfacial adhesion, compromising device stability. A donor&#8208;acceptor SAM, 4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino&#8208;2,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzoic acid (PAFTB), featuring an enhanced dipole moment and tailored functional groups, improves adhesion by 2.8 times, thereby enhancing both stability and efficiency of the devices. 








Abstract
Inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have outperformed traditional n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs in recent years. A key advancement is the use of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transport layers. One class of widely used SAMs is carbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acids. However, it is found that these SAMs lack strong binding with transparent conducting oxides (TCO) and perovskite. The weak binding strength results in suboptimal interfacial adhesion of the buried interface, which limits the device's stability. Here, interfacial binding is enhanced by increasing the dipole moment that creates a strong interfacial electric field that enhances electrostatic interactions at the TCO/perovskite interface, while incorporating tailored functional groups in SAMs to improve chemical anchoring to TCO and binding to perovskite. Specifically, the donor&#8208;acceptor SAM molecule 4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)&#8208;2,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzoic acid (PAFTB) is employed, which features an enhanced dipole moment along with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups to optimize interfacial interactions. Compared to extensively used [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), PAFTB enhances total interfacial adhesion by 2.8 times, thereby improving the thermal stability of the layer. Using this approach, PSCs are demonstrated with a certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state power conversion efficiency of 24.9% and maintain 80% of the&#160;initial efficiency after 900&#160;h of maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Oral Covalent Organic Frameworks as Dysbiosis&#8208;Mitigating Oxalate Sequestrants for Crystalline Nephropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally screened and engineered, nonabsorbable covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable a gut&#8208;restricted therapeutic strategy for hyperoxaluria&#8208;driven crystalline nephropathy. By promoting intestinal oxalate sequestration and microbiota restoration, the orally administered COFs reduce urinary oxalate excretion and suppress renal crystal deposition and inflammation via modulation of the gut&#8211;kidney axis, highlighting a translationally relevant utilization of COF&#8208;like materials for metabolite&#8208;driven pathologies.








Abstract
Hyperoxaluria&#8208;related crystalline nephropathy progresses through a dynamic interplay among oxalate crystallization, renal inflammatory cascades, and gut dysbiosis. However, concurrent interventions for these interconnected pathways remain elusive. Here, we leverage the gut&#8208;kidney axis to address this multifaceted renal issue by employing cationic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as dysbiosis&#8208;mitigating oxalate sequestrants. Oxalate adsorption assays and density functional theory calculations identify the HCl&#8208;activated pyridine&#8208;functionalized COF1&#8208;Cl with superior oxalate adsorption capacity (94.5 mg&#160;g&#8722;1) and selectivity. Oral administration of COF1&#8208;Cl in a rat model of hyperoxaluria effectively sequestrates oxalate within the gut and facilitates the transcellular secretion of serum oxalate into the intestinal lumen by upregulating the oxalate transporter (SLC26A6), resulting in decreased urinary oxalate excretion. Oxalate sequestration by COF1&#8208;Cl restores the gut microbiota diversity and promotes the rebalance of typical bacteria associated with oxalate metabolism, stone formation risk, and immune homeostasis. This local gut effect inhibits renal oxalate crystal deposition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in amelioration of renal function as evidenced by improved glomerular filtration and decreased blood creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. COF1&#8208;Cl also demonstrates good biosafety due to its inert and nonabsorbable nature. This work highlights the potential of utilizing a gut&#8208;restricted porous crystalline framework to address metabolism&#8208;driven pathology via gut&#8208;organ crosstalk.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Intrinsic Constraint Boosts Slow&#8208;Thermalization and Fast&#8208;Transfer of Carriers in FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint with triamino&#8208;linear GA&#8208;acid is implemented to create anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53%&#8211;0.78%) on QDs for stabilizing the perovskite lattice. Simultaneously, modulation of Pb&#8208;I/O bonding and Pb&#8208;Pb spacing optimizes nonadiabatic coupling and enhances charge carrier transfer. Finally, FAPbI3 QDSCs achieved a PCE of 17.11%, while retaining 81.4% of initial PCE after 1000 h of aging.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide quantum dots (FAPbI3 QDs) are extensively utilized in photovoltaic applications due to their superior optoelectronic characteristics. Nonetheless, the weak ionic bonds within their soft lattice structure lead to structural deformation, which causes a disordered charge distribution of FAPbI3 QDs. Stress engineering not only can mitigate the inherent soft lattice by reinforcing ion bonds but also can promote electron localization, thus enhancing charge carrier transfer. This work introduces a strain&#8208;induced intrinsic constraint (SIC) strategy that employs steric bulk modulation of nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands to induce anisotropic surface strain (&#603; = 0.53&#8211;0.78) in FAPbI3 QDs. By systematically designing nitrogen&#8208;coordinating ligands, guanidinium acetate (GA&#8208;acid) is demonstrated to facilitate controlled anisotropic lattice strain by filling A&#8208;site vacancies while simultaneously establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing stress, which effectively strengthens the antibonding interaction of Pb&#8208;O/I and reduces Pb&#8208;Pb orbital overlap, resulting in &#8220;slow&#8208;thermalization and fast&#8208;transfer&#8221; synergy for enhanced charge transfer. The PQDSCs engineered using the SIC approach achieve a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 17.11% and a highest short&#8208;circuit current density of 20.96 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. It is anticipated that stress&#8208;induced modulation of nanocrystals offers a critical insight for advancing the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Universal Centimeter&#8208;Scale van der Waals Epitaxy of Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Ferrites Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through directional domain stitching and interfacial symmetry coupling, highly oriented ultrathin ferrites films with robust ferrimagnetism up to 730 K are realized. This work establishes a scalable epitaxial paradigm for 2D magnetic oxides, unlocking new opportunities for spintronic integration on technologically relevant platforms.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials offer significant potential for advanced spintronics, but their practical implementation is hindered by fundamental limitations such as low Curie temperatures and the current inability to achieve scalable, large&#8208;area synthesis. Herein, a significant breakthrough in the centimeter&#8208;scale epitaxial growth of ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline magnetic ferrite films, including cobalt ferrite, manganese ferrite, and nickel ferrite is reported. By leveraging symmetry&#8208;matching&#8208;induced energy splitting between antiparallel orientations and developing a precisely engineered nucleation timing strategy to amplify synergistic coupling, unidirectional epitaxial growth with seamless domain coalescence is achieved. Comprehensive macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;characterizations confirmed the single&#8208;crystalline nature and high quality. Vibrating sample magnetometry measurements reveal robust ferrimagnetism persisting up to 730 K, while magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect microscopy visualized sharp uniform single&#8208;domain switching behavior. Interestingly, two potential strategies have been explored for heteroepitaxial integration of CFO thin films with engineered substrates. This work establishes a scalable and viable synthesis route for 2D magnetic oxides, marking a pivotal step toward their practical deployment in high&#8208;performance spintronic and quantum devices.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Order and Strong Quantum Coupling Enabled Stable Carrier Transport for Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address memristor reliability issues caused by stochastic carrier transport, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling are constructed via a dual&#8208;ligand strategy, minimizing energetic and positional disorder from atomic&#8208;scale QDs to macroscopic devices. This enhanced coupling surpasses localized quantum&#8208;confined states, ensuring stable, efficient carrier transport and yielding remarkable performance enhancements in neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing based on memristors holds significant potential for performing massively parallel computational tasks with high accuracy. However, its practical application is significantly limited by poor reliability, primarily due to instability in carrier transport. Here, long&#8208;range ordered quantum dot (QD) superlattices with strong quantum coupling is presented to enable carrier transport stability and improve device reliability. Leveraging a data&#8208;assisted QD synthesis optimization loop, Cu12Sb4S13 QDs are synthesized with precisely controlled growth kinetics, crystal orientation, and surface chemistry. These QDs self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered superlattices on flexible substrates, achieving a 56% reduction in inter&#8208;dot spacing (to 0.92 nm), aligned lattice orientations, and a 4.4&#8208;fold increase in carrier mobility. This architecture enables strong quantum coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations imposed by localized quantum&#8208;confined states. As a result, the QD&#8208;based memristors exhibit remarkable reliability, with variations below 0.1% over 8.4 &#215; 107 s of continuous operation and 106 rapid read cycles. They further demonstrate linear potentiation and depression characteristics (vp = 2.03 and vd = 2.33), a wide conductance range (Gmax/Gmin = 264), and high recognition accuracy (93.31%) as validated by chip&#8208;level convolutional neural network simulations. This work establishes a robust and flexible platform for memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic computing, offering a promising route to overcoming critical challenges in device reliability and computational performance.

         <title>Synthesis Engineering of 2D Co3Sn2S2 with Tunable Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), are obtained through flux transformation mechanism. Combining dimensionality advantages and controllable Fe doping, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials.








Abstract
2D kagome ferromagnetic materials serve as an exceptionally important platform for exploring spintronics and correlated quantum phenomena. However, the controllable synthesis of non&#8208;layered kagome ferromagnetic materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of van der Waals gap. Here, it is shown that ultrathin non&#8208;layered 2D Co3Sn2S2 single crystal with kagome lattice, which owns strong ferromagnetic order and giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is obtained through flux transformation mechanism, where ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is transformed from ultrathin layered intermediates of SnS2 or SnS. Magnetotransport measurements indicate that the AHE of the ultrathin Co3Sn2S2 single crystal is superior to those of its bulk and ultrathin polycrystalline counterparts. Further, combining dimensionality advantages and the introduced extrinsic contribution of Fe, where the doping concentration can be well controlled in 2D Co3Sn2S2, a giant anomalous Hall angle of 48% and an anomalous Hall conductivity of 2200&#8201;&#937;&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are achieved. Under zero magnetic field, these two values are, to the best of knowledge, almost the highest ever recorded than in most known magnetic materials. The results establish 2D non&#8208;layered ferromagnetic kagome lattice as a platform for exploration of quantum confinement effect and other correlated phenomena.

         <title>Metallic Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavity&#8208;Enhanced "Pseudo&#8208;Charge Transfer" Absorption for Efficient Narrowband Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetector is fabricated through engineering a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;gap molecule coupled with an optimized Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonant cavity. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt;60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining excellent bending and environmental stability.








Abstract
Narrowband short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors, combining wavelength&#8208;specific detection with the inherent advantages of organic semiconductors, are important candidates for many applications like medical diagnostics, industrial sorting, and environmental monitoring. However, previously reported spectral&#8208;narrowing strategies often compromise device performance through structural complexity and intrinsic limitations of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorption, even when coupled with strong cavity device architectures. To address this, a pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer state is engineered by doping an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap third component, simultaneously optimizing electrode processing to minimize parasitic absorption and interface energetic barriers. This co&#8208;design approach yields spectrally selective photodetectors with an EQE exceeding 40% at zero&#8208;bias at 1020 nm, a FWHM of &lt; 60 nm, a detectivity &gt; 3 &#215; 1013 Jones, and an over 140dB dynamic range, while maintaining flexibility. PET&#8208;based devices show &lt;5% performance degradation after 3000 bending cycles. This work establishes a general design paradigm for organic narrowband photodetectors that combines laboratory&#8208;scale performance with practical manufacturability for wearable and large&#8208;area SWIR applications.

         <title>Plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x/Ag Photocatalyst for the Fixation of N2 from Air with the Solar Energy Conversion Efficiency Reaching over 0.28%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x/Ag photocatalyst is designed for efficient N2 photofixation. It exhibits superior light absorption, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free feature, and plasmonic photothermal conversion. A diphase reaction platform is designed by loading the photocatalyst in a polymer film to suppress the light absorption of water and accelerate the mass transfer kinetics, giving a high photocatalytic efficiency of &gt;0.28% from air.








Abstract
Storing solar energy in chemical bonds through photocatalysis under ambient conditions is of great importance for sustainable development and carbon neutrality. In addition to the design of new photocatalysts with high activities, efficient solar energy delivery and the acceleration of reactant mass transfer kinetics are also crucial for efficient energy conversion. Herein, a new type of plasmonic Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free MoO3&#8722;x/Ag photocatalyst is designed for efficient NH3 production. The photocatalyst exhibits strong light absorption and utilization under sunlight illumination. The construction of a bilayer system reduces the light attenuation by water in the near&#8208;infrared region and accelerates the N2 mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the photocatalytic activity is largely boosted. A high solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of over 0.28% (&#177;0.01%) is reached with air directly used as the feeding gas. The study offers a promising pathway for the rational design of photocatalysts and photocatalytic platforms, enabling greatly enhanced solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Reverse Charge Transfer Drives d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization in Ruthenium&#8211;Oxygen Modified Zn3In2S6 for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electronegativity difference between oxygen and sulfur element, we designed and implemented ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6, which achieved controllable reverse photo&#8208;generated charge transfer. This carrier transportation enhanced the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between ruthenium and oxygen, promoting efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption and activation, ultimately leading to superior hydrogen peroxide evolution rate.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is emerging as a promising approach for sustainable H2O2 production. However, controlling the electronic structure and charge carrier dynamics to enhance oxygen adsorption and activation remains a major challenge. Here, ruthenium and oxygen co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S&#8326; (O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS) is presented, a catalyst design to achieve reverse photogenerated carrier transfer through tailored electronic modulation. The introduction of oxygen atoms, with higher electronegativity than sulfur, induces significant surface charge redistribution and transforms the Ru&#9472;S coordination environment from Ru&#9472;S4 (in Ru&#8208;ZIS) to Ru&#8208;S&#8321;O3 (in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS), as revealed by synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (SR&#8208;XAS). This structural transition drives a reversal in charge carrier transfer pathways: in Ru&#8208;ZIS, photogenerated electrons transfer from Ru sites to In sites, whereas in O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS, electrons transfer from In sites to Ru sites, as validated by in situ XPS and fs&#8208;TA spectra. This reverse charge transfer enhances d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Ru and O2, facilitating efficient charge redistribution, strong oxygen adsorption, and activation. In situ spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further corroborate these mechanistic insights. As a result, the O&#8208;Ru&#8208;ZIS catalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 3659&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions without requiring sacrificial agents, significantly outperforming conventional Zn3In2S6&#8208;based systems and other reported photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Buffered Sulfidation Stabilized B&#948;&#8722; in 1T MoS2: Orbital Alignment for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molybdenum aluminum boride&#8208;guided charge&#8208;buffered sulfidation strategy is proposed to stabilize anionic boron&#160;(B&#948;&#8722;) dopants in metallic phase molybdenum disulfide. The B&#948;&#8722; substitution not only generates a high&#8208;energy&#8208;state of empty pz orbital to unlock the rapid H2O dissociation, but also facilitates the H adsorption through modulating the electronic environment of adjacent sulfur, hence improving alkaline HER performance.








Abstract
The sp3 hybridization of surface sulfur in&#160;metallic phase molybdenum disulfide (1T MoS2) is identified as the intrinsic bottleneck for alkaline hydrogen production (HER), where their electron&#8208;saturated nature elevates the kinetic barrier for water dissociation. To overcome this limitation, a charge&#8208;buffered sulfidation strategy is reported to stabilize anionic boron (B&#948;&#8722;) within 1T MoS2. By employing molybdenum aluminum boride as the precursor, the B&#948;&#8722; dopants can be efficiently preserved via the topological confinement imposed by Mo&#9472;B&#9472;Mo network. This approach also maintains the 1T phase integrity through Al&#8208;mediated electron compensation. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that B&#948;&#8722; substitution generates vertically oriented empty pz orbitals through sp2 hybridization, which elevates orbital energy to align with molecular orbitals of water, significantly reducing the O&#9472;H cleavage barrier by over 80% compared to 1T MoS2. Concurrently, the B&#9472;Mo&#9472;S networks upshift adjacent sulfur 3p band centers to optimize the hydrogen adsorption path. These dual functionalities endow the pz&#8208;functionalized 1T MoS2 with a low overpotential of &#8722;30&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;current operation of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.779&#160;V in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrolytic cell. This work not only establishes orbital alignment as a transformative design principle for advanced electrocatalysts, but also paves a novel synthetic pathway for 1T transition metal disulfides.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Double&#8208;Drive Water Evaporation&#8208;Induced Generator Operating Without Liquid Water Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed with excellent electrical output performance (&gt;1 V, &gt;1 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) in multiple water sources and unveil the corresponding double&#8208;drive operation mechanism. Not limited to liquid water sources, DWEG can also generate sustainable electricity through the spontaneous harvesting of minimal water from the soil, even in low&#8208;temperature (&#8722;12 &#176;C) environments.








Abstract
Restricted electrical output and the heavy reliance on liquid water sources severely limit the further development of water evaporation&#8208;induced generators (WEGs) based on the inherently slow phase transition of water molecules. Here, inspired by the rolling logs to transport boulders, a double&#8208;drive WEG (DWEG) is developed, in which double ionic circulations and ion&#8208;electronic friction provide intensive horsepower and grip for energy capture. DWEGs applied in deionized water can continuously generate a high voltage of 1.13 V and a stable current of 10.54 &#181;A (1.76 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (&#8776;20 &#176;C, &#8776;43% RH). In addition, benefiting from the high osmotic pressure and mechanical strength of ionized composite hydrogels, DWEGs can be directly plugged into soil with minimal water (as little as 12.5 wt.%) to generate electricity, eliminating the reliance on a liquid water source. Interestingly, a high electrical output (0.65 V, 0.89 &#181;A) is sustained (&gt;60 h) at low&#8208;temperature (e.g., &#8722;12 &#176;C), overcoming the temporal and geographical restrictions of conventional WEGs in their practical applications.

         <title>A Flexible and Repairable Ultra&#8208;Broadband Electromagnetic Wave Absorber by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of membrane&#8208;free organelles for the construction of biological cells, a self&#8208;assembly strategy of photopolymerization&#8208;induced phase transition driving liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is proposed to construct conductive nanochannels and abundant heterogeneous interface for the repairable and durable ultra&#8211;broadband electromagnetic wave absorber (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz).








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption depends on the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, which heavily rely on the structural integrity via rigorous production process or extreme reaction condition, constraining their applications particularly in biomedicine and flexible electronics. Here, a simple one&#8208;step method is proposed to access a flexible and repairable ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorber by the photopolymerization of one common monomer in ionic liquid. The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation process of poly (N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) and ionic liquid results in a high polymer content network comprising conductive nanochannels intertwined with abundant polymer chain/ionic liquid heterogeneous interface (basic unit &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm). This strategy effectively achieves&#160;the balance of impedance matching and attenuation, and accesses the broadest effective absorption band in the single&#8208;layer absorbers (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;dB from 5 to 40&#8201;GHz). Moreover, the resultant polymer absorbers have high fracture strength (&#8776;8.2&#160;MPa), fracture energy (&#8776;774 kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and transparency (&#8776;85%), while being highly stretchable (&#8776;900% strain) and having repairable microwave absorption (&#8776;97% repaired in effective absorption bandwidth). Overall, this work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;broadband EMW absorbers, which will promote potential advances in flexible electromagnetic materials.

Moreover, the resultant polymer absorbers have high fracture strength (&#8776;8.2&#160;MPa), fracture energy (&#8776;774 kJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and transparency (&#8776;85%), while being highly stretchable (&#8776;900% strain) and having repairable microwave absorption (&#8776;97% repaired in effective absorption bandwidth). Overall, this work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of ultra-broadband EMW absorbers, which will promote potential advances in flexible electromagnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Nanovaccine Platform Based on M13 Bacteriophage for Personalized Cancer Vaccine and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reprogrammed (RP) phage&#8208;based nanovaccine platform has been developed that allows single&#8208;step assembly with precise control over adjuvanticity, antigen density, and nanoparticle size. By enhancing TLR9 activation and neoantigen display, this platform enables a potent personalized vaccine targeting tumor&#8208;specific neoantigens. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the RP phage&#8208;based vaccine induces tumor regression and provides complete protection against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Nanovaccines co&#8208;assemble antigens and adjuvants to elicit robust immune responses but often require complex synthesis and post&#8208;modification procedures. Here, a programmable nanovaccine platform based on the M13 bacteriophage is developed for the scalable production of vaccines and single&#8208;step modular engineering of adjuvanticity, length, and antigen density. By reprogramming the sequence and size of the noncoding phage genome, the Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 activation and the length of the phage are precisely controlled. With a novel molecular engineering approach, the antigen density is tuned from 13.6% to 70.3%. A systematic modulation reveals an optimal adjuvanticity at a constant antigen density for maximum anti&#8208;tumor CD8+ T cell response, and vice versa, using the model antigen SIINFEKL. The M13 phage&#8208;based nanovaccine induces durable memory immunity lasting over a year. In addition, a 24&#8208;fold increase in neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell frequency is achieved when increasing both the adjuvanticity and antigen density. Furthermore, when combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy, the M13 phage&#8208;based personalized vaccine eradicates established MC&#8208;38 tumors in 75% of treated animals and they develop 100% resistance against tumor invasion when challenged 5 months after treatment. These findings establish M13 phage as a powerful and versatile nanovaccine platform with transformative potential for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Thermite Reaction&#8208;Induced Thermal Runaway of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor safety performances of high&#8208;energy lithium batteries are now threatening the lives and properties of human beings. Herein, it is found that cathode current collector aluminum (Al) foil can react with cathode active materials to form thermites. The thermite reaction releases energy accounting for &#8776;10 times of electric energy of the lithium&#8208;ion battery with 100% state of charge (SoC).








Abstract
Safety is a primary concern for the widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles as well as energy storage. Despite the numerous mechanisms proposed to explain thermal runaway (TR) and the various methods implemented to mitigate it, battery explosions still occur. This is predominantly due to an insufficient understanding of the TR mechanism. Herein, by combining various advanced analytical techniques with comprehensive analysis, it is found that aluminum (Al) foil, typically employed as the cathode current collector in LIBs, can react with some cathode active materials to form thermites. These thermite reactions generate substantial heat, contributing to explosions of LIBs, a mechanism that has been largely overlooked. Based on these findings, it is proposed that coating the Al foil with carbon can partially suppress these thermite reactions and substantially enhance the thermal stability of LIBs. This study offers new insights into the TR of LIBs and provides important guidance for developing safer batteries.

         <title>Scalable Production of Highly&#8208;Reliable Graphene&#8208;Based Microchips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compares GFETs with Al2O3 and hBN gate dielectrics on microchips, evaluating their stability and reliability. It highlights the superior performance of GFETs with hBN dielectric in maintaining ultra&#8208;low hysteresis (&#12296;20 mV) and minimal shifts in ID&#8208;VG characteristics over 2000 cycles, particularly at the charge neutrality point, in contrast to those with Al2O3 dielectric.








Abstract
Graphene is a gapless 2D material that could be used to fabricate superior electronic devices and circuits, particularly useful in the fields of telecommunication and sensing. While promising performance has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale, graphene integrated circuits at the wafer level suffer from poor reliability due to native defects, especially at interfaces with dielectrics and electrodes. Here, we show the fabrication of highly reliable graphene&#8208;based microchips, containing transistors and frequency doublers, on 200&#160;mm wafers through a multi&#8208;project wafer tape&#8208;out. Our transistors use multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as gate dielectric, and they exhibit record performance in terms of reliability. In particular, our hBN/graphene transistors show ultra&#8208;low hysteresis below 20 mV and negligible shifts of the on&#8208;state current and the charge neutrality point even after 2100 cycles. The ultra&#8208;stable response of our hBN/graphene transistors contrasts with that of devices using metal&#8208;oxide gate dielectrics (HfO2, Al2O3), which exhibit severe degradation after a few dozens of cycles. These results, consistent across multiple devices, show low variability and demonstrate a scalable process for mass production of graphene&#8208;based microchips.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mechanoluminescence of Pr3+&#8208;Doped Perovskite Oxide for 3D Strain Sensing and Visualization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pr3+&#8208;doped perovskite oxide (NaTaO3) that exhibits ultrasensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) responses with a deformation detection limit of 0.01% is developed in this work. Impressively, its potential for the real&#8208;time, recoverable, and visual strain sensing capabilities in 3D spaces is verified, providing an exemplary application in advanced strain sensing and visualization at microscopic and multidimensional scales.








Abstract
Owing to the unique mechano&#8208;optical response, mechanoluminescence (ML) materials possess dynamic, sensitive, visual, and recoverable strain sensing capabilities. However, the dilemma of lacking outstanding ML materials with high detection precision under micro deformations still exists, thereby hindering advanced applications in multi&#8208;angle and multidimensional scenarios. Herein, a novel Pr3+&#8208;doped perovskite oxide (NaTaO3:Pr3+)&#8208;based composite elastic thin film is developed, which achieves ultrasensitive ML responses to both microscale compressive and tensile strains. Compared with the record of LiTaO3:Tb3+, the corresponding deformation detection limit has been improved by five times, reaching 0.01%, which is comparable to the performance of the widely used piezoresistive and capacitive sensors. The results reveal that the ML originates from the interaction between adjacent defects and the varying local piezoelectric fields near PrNaO9 and PrTaO6 polyhedra. Most notably, the strain and ML demonstrate identical distributions on a 3D&#8208;printed model coated with NaTaO3:Pr3+ thin film even under micro deformation less than 0.4%, highlighting the significant potential of NaTaO3:Pr3+ for advanced 3D microstrain sensing applications. This work provides convincing insights into the investigation of ML mechanisms through local trap and piezoelectricity analyses, along with an exemplificative application in advanced strain sensing and visualization at microscopic and multidimensional scales.

         <title>Molecularly Programmed Twisting in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal Enables Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity at High Temperatures</title>

A stable 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic crystal is reported to exhibit extraordinary anhydrous superprotonic conductivity for promising application as a solid electrolyte in high&#8208;temperature fuel cells.








Abstract
A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Crystal (HOC&#8208;88) is reported that achieves unprecedented anhydrous superprotonic conductivity through a molecular topology&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly strategy. Single&#8208;crystal analysis uncovers a saddle&#8208;distorted &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomer with eight phenolic hydroxyl groups, whose synergistic geometric confinement enables spontaneous formation of self&#8208;templated 3D proton highways&#8208;a phenomenon yet to be observed in crystalline organic conductors. The double torsion of the &#960;&#8208;system induces helical cooperativity between hydrogen&#8208;bonded lamellae and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked columns, generating interconnected proton pathways with negative thermal expansion behavior along the c&#8208;axis. This unique mechanism allows HOC&#8208;88 to maintain ultrastable proton conduction without humidity dependence, surpassing all known HOCs and routing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF/COF analogues. Crucially, the framework demonstrates chemical omniphobicity&#8208;retaining crystallinity in boiling water (100 &#176;C), concentrated acid (0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m HCl), and 300&#160;&#176;C in air conditions. When deployed in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell prototype, it establishes the first experimental evidence of HOC operating in practical high&#8208;temperature electrochemical devices. The findings reveal that controlled helical distortion in &#960;&#8208;systems can programmatically dictate long&#8208;range proton ordering, opening an unexplored dimension for designing next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;A Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Crystal (HOC-88) is reported that achieves unprecedented anhydrous superprotonic conductivity through a molecular topology-driven hierarchical assembly strategy.

         <title>Disordered Cu Sites in Amorphous Cu2Te Nanosheets Promote Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D crystalline Cu2Te nanosheets (c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) are converted into oxygen&#8208;doped amorphous analogues (a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) via controlled air calcination. This amorphization induces Cu 3d&#8211;O 2p orbital hybridization, enhancing electronic structure and active site density. The a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs deliver 91.7% ethylene Faradaic efficiency and 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density with outstanding stability in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation offers a sustainable and energy&#8208;efficient alternative to conventional thermocatalytic methods, yet remains challenged by competing side reactions, including hydrogen evolution, over&#8208;hydrogenation, and carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. Here, the transformation of 2D van der Waals crystalline Cu2Te nanosheets (c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped amorphous analogues (a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) via controlled air calcination is reported. The resulting a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs feature a disordered Cu coordination network and deliver an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 91.7% at a high partial current density of 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, along with excellent stability, outperforming both c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Mechanism investigations reveal that structural amorphization drives the redistribution of interlayer Cu atoms and alters key electronic properties, including the density of states and the Cu d&#8208;band center, through Cu 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization. These effects increase the density of accessible Cu active sites, optimize adsorption energetics, accelerate interfacial water dissociation, and promote hydrogen accumulation, thereby effectively suppressing undesirable side reactions. This work highlights amorphous engineering as a powerful strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enhancing the Operational Lifetime of OLEDs Through the Modulation of Rigidity and Excited&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategic molecular design utilizing fused B/N and C &#9552; O/N units within the MR&#8208;TADF framework to enhance molecular rigidity and accelerate RISC, resulting in efficient sky&#8208;blue OLEDs. BNTO&#8208;based hyper&#8208;fluorescence OLEDs achieved a moderate EQE of 19.4% and a LT70 of 500 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, emphasizing the importance of structural rigidification and excited&#8208;state engineering for color purity and stability.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;emitting multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high robustness with short&#8208;lived emission lifetime is particularly desired for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, a series of MR&#8208;TADF molecules featuring fused boron/nitrogen (B/N) and C &#9552; O/N frameworks is reported. These emitters namely BNO, BNDO, and BNTO are systematically designed and synthesized to investigate the impact of molecular rigidity or planarity toward their excited&#8208;state dynamics through stepwise intramolecular electrophilic acylation reactions. Computational studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data revealed the enhanced planarity of BNDO and BNTO. Upon photoexcitation, these compounds exhibited blue emission with PLQYs of approaching unity and short&#8208;lived delayed lifetimes (&lt;2 &#181;s). BNTO&#8208;based OLEDs achieved sky&#8208;blue emission peaking at 489 nm, a moderate device operational lifetime of over 500 h at 70% of the initial brightness (LT70) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, which shows longer device stability when compared with BNO and greener emission when compared to BNDO. This study highlights that manipulation of the rigidity of compounds and emissive states of MR&#8208;TADF compounds is essential in achieving blue emission and improving OLED operational stability.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Biomimetic Intelligent Immune Organelles for the Treatment of Bladder&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an orbital hybridization rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic intelligent immune organelles for the treatment of bladder&#8208;metastasized tumors. Additionally, the organelle demonstrates a response to the tumor microenvironment by releasing RePd nanozyme and PD&#8208;L1 nb, which enhance tumor accumulation and facilitate synergistic catalytic&#8208;photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Immune&#8208;checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of bladder cancer. However, inadequate immune responses restrict their clinical application. To increase the efficacy of ICIs, a nanozyme&#8208;based intelligent biomimetic immune organelle has been developed for the treatment of metastatic bladder tumors. Initially, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanozyme platform is constructed using 1,2&#8208;Distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;Tk&#8208;(polyethylene glycol) (DSPE&#8208;TK&#8208;PEG)&#160;to assemble ultrasmall p&#8208;d orbital hybrid bimetallic rhenium (Re)&#8208;palladium (Pd) nanozyme. The orbital hybridization between the Re and Pd atoms significantly enhances the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of the Pd nanozyme. Additionally, the RePd nanozyme exhibits notable glutathione oxidase (GSH&#8208;OXD)&#8208;like activity, which reduces the clearance of ROS and enhances its capacity to induce oxidative stress. This platform is then coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) engineered with PD&#8208;L1 nanobody (nb), which form RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb. Upon entry into the tumor microenvironment, the RePd nanozyme is released, and the PD&#8208;L1 nb specifically binds to the tumor cell membrane to relieve its inhibition of T cells. Moreover, RePd@OMVsPD&#8208;L1 nb demonstrates enhanced tumor accumulation and promotes synergistic catalytic&#8210;photothermal therapy, inducing immunogenic cell death and promoting immune activation through the release of adjuvants. Consequently, the efficacy of PD&#8208;L1 nb is significantly improved, leading to the effective eradication of tumor cells and the inhibition of recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Hyaluronic Acid with Double Helix Ion Channels for Efficient Electrolyte Retention and Polysulfide Regulation in Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural moisturizing material, hyaluronic acid, is developed to enhance electrolyte adsorption and polysulfide capture via intramolecular hydrogen bonds, eliminate polysulfides by its superior radical&#8208;scavenging capability, and expedite electron/Li+ transport by spiral acceleration effect, thus boosting sulfur redox reaction kinetics and achieving outstanding electrochemical performance of lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Catalyzing sulfur conversion is an efficient solution to overcome poor ion transfer, severe shuttle effect, and unfavored electrode passivation in lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, a natural moisturizing material, hyaluronic acid (HA), is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to promote the adsorptions of electrolyte and polysulfides via intramolecular hydrogen bonds, providing sufficient electrolyte contacts for subsequent catalytic reactions. Rely on its radical&#8208;scavenging capability, HA facilitates the conversion of polysulfide radicals at N sites, suppressing shuttle effect. Due to the spiral acceleration effect of double helix structure, HA accelerates Li+ migration, enhancing the lithiation kinetics of system. Consequently, under sulfur loading of 8 mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte of 3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1 conditions, the HA&#8208;modified cells deliver a high areal capacity of 11.76 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a gravimetric energy density of 409 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides a fresh insight into developing natural moisturizing materials as electrocatalysts toward practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Cage Effect of Nitrogen Oxide Radicals Enables Li&#8208;NOx Cell with a 3.8&#160;V Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;NOx battery chemistry achieves reversible 3.8 V operation by harnessing the cage effect of nitrogen oxide (NO) radicals. This strategy establishes a viable NOx redox mechanism for high&#8208;voltage energy storage and presents a sustainable route for NOx valorization.








Abstract
The utilization of redox&#8208;active gas as cathode materials has been proposed as a promising approach to meet the demand for next&#8208;generation battery technologies. Toward this end, nitrogen oxides (NOx)&#8212;inexpensive, abundant gases readily produced from ammonia on an industrial scale&#8212;is a promising energy storage media; however, its utilization as cathode material has not been achieved. In this work, the cage effect of NO and NO2 radicals are utilized to stabilize the charge product of Li&#8208;NOx cell as N2O3. This cell operates via reversible redox of LiNO3 to N2O3, achieving a specific capacity of 1,570&#160;mA h gcarbon&#8722;1 or 25&#8201;mA h&#8201;cmelectrode&#8722;2&#160;at a full cell voltage of 3.85&#160;V with an average energy efficiency of 89% at a current density up to 2&#160;mA cmelectrode&#8722;2. These metrics represent one of the highest areal capacity, current density, cell voltage, and energy efficiency reported for a metal&#8208;gas cells.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Directed Assembly in Achiral Point Groups for Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports two compounds crystallizing in achiral point groups (2/m and 1&#175;$\bar{1}$) that exhibit circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the synergistic effect of intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding during crystallization induces symmetry breaking, facilitating directed helical assembly. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) reach 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (543 nm) and 4.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2 (550 nm), respectively.








Abstract
Very recently, considerable attention has been given to pure organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (CP&#8208;RTP) materials due to their unique photophysical properties. However, the directed construction of optically active phosphorescent signals within achiral systems remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two achiral crystals, 2CN4S and 2F4S, belonging to the achiral point groups 2/m and 1&#175;$\bar{1}$, exhibit strong CP&#8208;RTP emission with high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) up to 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (543 nm) and 4.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (550 nm), respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the intrinsic mirror&#8208;antiparallel molecular conformations induced by the targeted substitution of cyano/fluoro groups, which spontaneously assemble into symmetry&#8208;breaking helical superstructures through synergistic C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This work not only establishes a novel approach for CP&#8208;RTP material design but also overcomes structural constraints in optically active materials within achiral point group systems.

         <title>Discovery of Nodal&#8208;Line Superconductivity in Chiral Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral crystals, characterized by their structural handedness, exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. The La(Rh,Ir)Si family, featuring a double&#8208;helix chiral structure, hosts unconventional multifold fermion excitations and topological nodal&#8208;line superconductivity, the latter arising from an isotropic spin&#8208;orbit coupling with a specific strength. The proposed pairing phase diagram provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional superconductivity in chiral crystals.








Abstract
Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral&#8208;crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials is reported by combining muon&#8208;spin spectroscopy, band&#8208;structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double&#8208;helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully&#8208;gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4d&#8208;Rh by 5d&#8208;Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal&#8208;line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal&#8208;line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands the conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing. The current&#160;work establishes a new type of phase diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors with a chiral&#160;structure.

         <title>Dynamic Confinement and High&#8208;Entropy Catalytic Synergy Engineering in Hollow Nano&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

This study proposes a generalized dynamic template strategy for the controllable synthesis of H&#8208;MOFs (e.g., ZIF&#8208;67 and Co&#8208;BTC) and systematically investigates the effects of pore size, functional groups, and multimetal synergism on the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The study also screens out a high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;hosted HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. XAFS and in situ characterizations confirm that the hierarchical structure mitigates active material deactivation and host degradation.








Abstract
The systematic regulation of the pore size and chemical environment of nano&#8208;metal&#8208;organic skeletons (n&#8208;MOFs) has been challenged, making it difficult to study their structure&#8208;property relationships in depth. In this study, a universal dynamic template strategy is proposed and successfully achieves the controllable construction of various hollow n&#8208;MOFs (including ZIF&#8208;67, Co&#8208;BTC, etc.). Based on this, the progressive optimization mechanism of pore size limitation (3.4&#8211;18 &#197;), functional group modification (&#9472;H, &#9472;NH2, etc.), and multi&#8208;metal (Co, Ni, etc.) synergism on the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is systematically revealed, and the long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life sulfur host HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is further screened. The experimental findings and in situ characterizations collectively demonstrate that hierarchical structural optimization synergistically mitigates active material deactivation and host structure degradation. This work not only provides an integrated &#8220;synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; material design paradigm for Li&#8211;S batteries, but also provides a theoretical basis for extending the multiscale optimization logic to other multistep reactive systems.

         <title>Fluorinated Pseudo&#8208;Halide Anion Enables &gt;19% Efficiency and Durable Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudo&#8208;halide, short&#8208;chain, and hydrophobicity anion PF6&#8722; is introduced to form a ligand shell of FAPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) to overcome surface defect density, inter&#8208;dot transport, and instability challenges, output a record&#8208;high efficiency of over 19% and improve long&#8208;term stability in PQD solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), like formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. Surface manipulation of PQDs has been extensively reported to be crucial to their photovoltaic performance due to the dynamic binding of capping long&#8208;chain ligands. In this work, an efficient surface engineering strategy employing a multifunctional fluorinated pseudo&#8208;halide anion ligand, hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8722;) is reported for achieving efficient FAPbI3 PQD solar cells. Leveraging its coordination capability, large ionic radius (2.38 &#197;), and intrinsic hydrophobicity, PF6&#8722; simultaneously passivates iodide vacancies, minimizes inter&#8208;dot spacing for enhanced electronic coupling, suppresses ion migration, and provides a hydrophobic barrier. By replacing oleate ligands with PF6&#8722; in FAPbI3 PQDs, an unprecedented high efficiency of 19.01% (17.19% for a 1 cm2&#8208;sized device) is achieved, and enhanced storage and operational stability. These findings will provide insight into the design of robust surface structures and low&#8208;trap&#8208;states PQD films toward high&#8208;efficiency and stable solar cells.

         <title>Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Materials with Ultralong Lifetimes and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Features Through Relay Phosphor Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow (NIR&#8208;AG) materials are successfully developed using a facile relay phosphor strategy and an efficient phosphorescence resonance energy transfer process. Bright NIR&#8208;AG materials are first reported with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics and an ultralong lifetime of 269&#160;ms at an emission maximum of 822&#160;nm, demonstrating the best performance among the organic afterglow materials and highlighting their versatile applications.








Abstract
Organic materials with afterglow properties have gained significant interest owing to their long lifetimes and potential applications. However, most of these organic materials emit light in the visible region, posing a significant challenge for developing near&#8208;infrared afterglow (NIR&#8208;AG). In this study, NIR&#8208;AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features are fabricated using a relay phosphor strategy. Red relay phosphors are easily fabricated by incorporating pyrene derivatives into an electron&#8208;rich matrix. The triplet excited energy of the relay phosphor is manipulated and effectively transferred to the excited singlet state of the AIE molecule via phosphorescence resonance energy transfer. Following the radiative decay of the excitons, an exceptional NIR&#8208;AG is ultimately generated with an ultralong lifetime of 269&#160;ms at an emission maximum of 822&#160;nm. The NIR&#8208;AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and AIE characteristics are reported for the first time, demonstrating one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials. Notably, the NIR&#8208;AG materials can be processed into diverse aggregated forms for advanced anticounterfeiting, fingerprint identification, information encryption, and tissue penetration imaging using red and NIR dual&#8208;delay channels with good performances. These promising findings are encouraging for the development of organic NIR&#8208;AG materials with exceptional performance.

         <title>High Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Multifunctional Spiro Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SAM is designed by introducing heteroatoms into a spiro structure, named Spiro&#8208;S, which achieves four functions: 1) the spiro structure suppresses molecular aggregation to ensure uniform substrate coverage; 2) the incorporated heteroatoms passivate buried interface defects; 3) enhancing perovskite crystallization; 4) suitable energy level. The resulting Spiro&#8208;S&#8208;based device demonstrates an exceptional PCE of 25.75% with improved stability.








Abstract
In inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the arrangement of self&#8208;assembled hole&#8208;transporting monolayers (SAMs) on substrates and their interaction with perovskite layer are critical for device efficiency and stability. Herein, two spiro SAMs are developed by introducing O and S atoms into the structure, named Spiro&#8208;O and Spiro&#8208;S, respectively. On one hand, the unique orthogonal molecular configuration of the spiro structure weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, thereby inhibiting molecular aggregation. This ensures uniform coverage on the substrate and a homogeneous surface potential distribution. On the other hand, the lone pair electrons of the introduced heteroatoms can interact with the Pb2+ ions, enhancing the quality of the perovskite film and effectively passivating the defects at the perovskite/SAM interface. The experimental and theoretical results show that the S in Spiro&#8208;S strongly interacts with perovskite, resulting in the formation of a more uniform and higher&#8208;quality crystalline perovskite layer. Compared to PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;O, the device with Spiro&#8208;S shows decreased defects at the buried interface, ultimately achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.75% (certified 25.19%). Furthermore, the PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;S also exhibit better long stability; the unencapsulated champion devices retain 92% of the initial efficiency after being stored at 25&#160;&#176;C for 1200 h.

         <title>2D Cuprous Halide Scintillator with Dual Excitation&#8208;Dependent and Thermochromic Luminescence toward Multifunctional Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D lead&#8208;free cuprous halide, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine), exhibits excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescence from blue, white to orange emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. The color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting and excellent scintillation performance support the promising applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode, laser technology, flexible temperature sensor, X&#8208;ray detection, medical diagnosis, and nondestructive inspection, etc.








Abstract
Excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent multicolor luminescent materials are valuable in advanced optoelectronic devices while they haven't been realized in 2D metal halides owing to the restrictions of Kasha's rule. Herein, we reported a novel 2D lead&#8208;free halide of (AMP)2Cu2Br4 (AMP = N&#8208;aminomorpholine) through structural engineering, in which the [Cu2Br4]2&#8722; layer is composed of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;shared [CuBr4] tetrahedron. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure enables (AMP)2Cu2Br4 to exhibit an impressive second&#8208;harmonic generation signal of &#8776;0.8 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Remarkably, (AMP)2Cu2Br4 possesses two independent self&#8208;trapped exciton&#8208;emitting states under different excitation energies, which display multicolor luminescence outputs from blue, white, to orange with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Additionally, the luminescence can be regulated in a wide temperature range of 300&#8211;400 K due to reversible energy transfer between two emitting bands, acting as a luminescence ratio thermometer with a ultrahigh relative thermal sensitivity of 56.755% K&#8722;1. High PLQY and large Stokes shift further endow (AMP)2Cu2Br4 strong radioluminescence with an ultrahigh light yield of 92,400 photons&#183;MeV&#8722;1, low detection limit of 121 nGyair&#183;s&#8722;1 and a short afterglow of 0.41&#160;ms. The abundant photophysical properties highlight the multiple optoelectronic applications of 2D cuprous halide in white light&#8208;emitting, laser technology, flexible temperature sensors, and X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Inspired In&#8208;Memory Data Pruning and Computing with TaOx Mem&#8208;Selectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>

In article number 2502168, Zhongrui Wang, Xiaoxin Xu, Dashan Shang, and co&#8208;workers present the first nanoscale Mem&#8208;Selector device that integrates both nonvolatile resistive memory and volatile threshold switching functionalities for visual data pruning. By co&#8208;locating pruning, storage, and computation&#8208;analogous to biological synapses&#8208;such device can concurrently filter and process essential information, significantly reducing data movement overhead and facilitating energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;latency edge intelligence.








Abstract
The selective attention mechanisms inherent in the human visual system provide a promising framework for developing edge systems that can simultaneously prune and process critical information from visual input. However, conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based edge vision systems rely on complex digital logic for data pruning, alongside the physical separation of pruning, memory, and processing. This increases both power consumption and latency. Herein, a Mem&#8208;Selector (M&#8208;S) device that features reconfigurable non&#8208;volatile resistive memory and volatile threshold switching in a Ta/TaOx/Ta2O5 stack is presented. For the first time, using transmission electron microscopy, the formation and rupture of conductive oxygen vacancy filaments are observed when the device operates as a resistive memory, as well as the growth of Ta&#8208;rich nanocrystalline clusters when it switches to threshold mode. This suggests the coexistence of ionic and electronic switching mechanisms. By leveraging a multifunctional M&#8208;S device, an in&#8208;memory pruning&#8208;computing (IMPC) system that simultaneously prunes and processes information is constructed. The IMPC system, inspired by human visual&#8208;selective attention, the IMPC system adaptively extracts essential information while pruning trivial inputs based on task complexity. This approach optimizes the balance between hardware cost and classification performance. Compared to conventional in&#8208;memory computing systems, the integrated IMPC system reduces input energy consumption by 29%, 54%, and 90% with less than 1% accuracy loss. Additionally, it shows robustness improvements of 7.6%, 29.8%, and 80.7% on the CIFAR&#8208;10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST datasets, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of hardware&#8208;software co&#8208;design for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance edge&#160;hardware.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Faults Induced Enhanced Emission in Ligand Stabilized Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study overcomes challenges in visualizing atomic&#8208;level defects in perovskite nanocrystals, promising to significantly improve the stability and performance of quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices. Using double&#8208;Cs&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, the study enables atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of elusive RuddlesdenPopper faults hidden within CsPbBr3&#8722;xIx nanocrystals. Lead, cesium, bromine, and iodine atoms are identified precisely, revealing their spatial arrangement within a single nanocrystal. 








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) interfaces is challenging due to their concealment within perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and the inherent limitations of conventional characterization techniques. In this study, distinctly oriented RP faults have been detected using double&#8208;Cs&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A simple yet reliable STEM approach to achieve atomically precise identification of Pb, Cs, Br, and I atoms and analyze their spatial atomic arrangements in a single NC is employed. In addition, dislocations caused by lattice mismatch at grain boundaries (GBs) are identified. Lattice strain in GBs and RPs is determined and quantified, revealing that neither of these planar defects introduces the deep trap levels. Therefore, in absence of Pb dangling bonds or Pb&#9472;Pb bonds in GBs and RPs plays a crucial role in stabilizing NCs and preventing ion migration. Incorporating n&#8208;octylammonium iodide in pristine CsPbBr3 quantum dots leads to the formation of CsPbBr3&#8722;xIx NCs, resulting in a significant redshift in electroluminescence (&#8776;496&#8211;623 nm) with enhanced intensity (&#8776;79%), attributed to higher exciton lifetime, increased exciton binding energy, and improved carrier confinement in flexible light&#8208;emitting devices. Density functional theory calculations confirm that additional carriers localized at the interface enhance electron&#8211;hole recombination, ensuring stable charge transportation for lighting devices.

         <title>Direct Laser Writing of Polymer Nanocomposites for Tunable Structural Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, direct laser writing is used to polymerize self&#8208;assembled nanocomposite materials. Using fabrication parameters, the interparticle spacing is finely tuned beyond the thermodynamically stable state. This is exploited to generate wide gamut structural color in water. Numerical simulations are used to support this, to enable the use of scattering spectra to predict volume fraction and interparticle spacing on the nanoscale.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled colloidal particles offer a means of manipulating light, giving rise to some of the most brilliant structural colors. Conventionally, changing the reflection band of colloidal crystal assemblies has required the synthesis of different&#8208;sized nanoparticles or multiple fabrication steps. This is not a means conducive to fine&#8208;tuning structural color. Herein, it is shown that, by combining nanocomposite photoresists, self&#8208;assembly, and direct laser writing, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;resolution fabrication and precise placement of nanoparticles, combined with highly tunable structural color using one composition and one particle size. Confinement of polymerization brought by direct laser writing allows for fine control over a series of fabrication parameters, such as slicing and hatching distances, thereby enabling control of the inter&#8208;particle distance in a nanocomposite. This is key to generating microstructures that exhibit a wide gamut of color that traverses the visible spectrum. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations are further used as a means of understanding the structural modifications that control color variation. The method described herein is suitable for fine&#8208;tuning of structural color in self&#8208;assembled systems, and is applicable to a wide range of materials.

         <title>Multimodal Actuation and Precise Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Optical Fiber Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LCE optical fiber artificial muscles achieve 40% contraction with precise waveguide control. By being integrated into bundles, LCEOFs exhibit multimodal actuation, including long&#8208;distance contraction (&#8805;5&#160;cm), sustaining weightlifting (&gt;4000 times their own&#160;weight), omnidirectional bending (0&#8211;360&#176;), and wide&#8208;range torsion (0&#8211;180&#176;). Furthermore, the LCEOFs can be easily integrated into artificial hands and robotic systems for delicate, coordinated tasks in confined spaces.








Abstract
Artificial muscles mimicking the fibrous structure and functionalities of natural skeletal muscles have garnered substantial interest for applications in actuators, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. However, achieving multidirectional actuation and delicate manipulation in confined environments remains challenging. Inspired by the neuromuscular system, a novel liquid crystal elastomer optical fiber (LCEOF) is introduced as artificial muscle with multimodal actuation and precise control. Fabricated through a two&#8208;step process, the LCEOFs possess sufficient orientation order (0.65) and low optical transmission loss (0.37&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1), enabling over 40% contraction strain with minimal ambient interference. Bundling multiple LCEOFs yields artificial arms capable of complicated and controllable deformations, including long&#8208;distance contraction (&#8805;5&#160;cm), weightlifting (&gt;4000 times their own weight), wide&#8208;range torsion (0&#8211;180&#176;), and omnidirectional bending (0&#8211;360&#176;). Multimodal actuation is precisely and independently regulated via terminal&#8208;coupled laser inputs for each LCEOF in bundled arrays, enabling coordinated, crosstalk&#8208;free motions. These optical fiber artificial muscles allow precise and controllable operation of an artificial hand for grasping and manipulating objects, without reliance on free&#8208;space lateral illumination. Additionally, robotics systems incorporating bundles of LCEOFs have been designed and demonstrated for tasks such as laser writing and object transfer in confined environments, thereby offering new possibilities for the advancement of smart actuators.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1000&#160;&#176;C Sintering of Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells via Microwave&#8208;Driven Vapor Phase Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative microwave&#8208;driven vapor&#8208;phase sintering strategy enables densification of proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes at 980&#160;&#176;C, reducing the sintering temperature by over 500&#160;&#176;C and addressing a major bottleneck toward PCEC manufacturing.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) hold significant promise for efficient power generation and sustainable hydrogen production. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the extreme sintering conditions required for electrolyte densification, often causing performance degradation due to Ba evaporation. Herein, microwave&#8208;driven vapor&#8208;phase diffusion sintering (MV&#8208;sintering) is introduced as an innovative approach for fabricating fully dense, stoichiometric electrolytes at a significantly reduced sintering temperature of 980&#160;&#176;C. This method demonstrates broad applicability across proton&#8208;conducting oxide electrolytes. The MV&#8208;sintered PCEC (MV&#8208;PCEC)&#160;achieves exceptional power densities of &#8776;2&#160;W cm&#8722;2 (600&#160;&#176;C) in fuel cell mode, alongside a remarkably high current density of 3.65 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V (650&#160;&#176;C) in electrolysis mode. Digital twin analysis underscores the MV&#8208;PCEC's enhanced microstructural features, including finer phase morphology, increased active sites, and improved gas transport. These findings provide critical insights into advancing sintering strategies for high&#8208;performance PCECs while mitigating challenges associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature processing.

         <title>Perovskite Microwires for Room Temperature Exciton&#8208;Polariton Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton&#8208;polaritons are explored as a novel platform for optical neuromorphic computing at room temperature using a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide. Demonstrating non&#8208;equilibrium Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation, this work achieves machine learning tasks such as classification and object detection, marking a key advance toward energy&#8208;efficient, practical polariton neural networks and next&#8208;generation optical computing accelerators.








Abstract
Limitations of electronics have stimulated the search for novel unconventional computing platforms that enable energy&#8208;efficient and ultra&#8208;fast information processing. Among various systems, exciton&#8208;polaritons stand out as promising candidates for the realization of optical neuromorphic devices. This is due to their unique hybrid light&#8208;matter properties, resulting in strong optical nonlinearity and excellent transport capabilities. However, previous implementations of polariton neural networks are restricted to cryogenic temperatures, limiting their practical applications. In this work, using non&#8208;equilibrium Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation in a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide, the first room&#8208;temperature exciton&#8208;polariton neural network is demonstrated. Its performance is verified in various machine learning tasks, including binary classification, and object detection. The result is a crucial milestone in the development of practical applications of polariton neural networks and provides new perspectives for optical computing accelerators based on&#160;perovskites.

         <title>Eliminating Mobility&#8208;Thickness Dependence in Transparent Conductive Oxide Layer Growth: A Critical Nucleation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical nucleation strategy is developed to eliminate mobility&#8208;thickness dependence in transparent conductive oxides. Via regulating reactive plasma deposition conditions, ultrathin cerium&#8208;doped indium oxide layers are fabricated with high mobility values. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for achieving high&#8208;quality ultrathin oxide semiconductor films in optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Carrier mobility is a key parameter for transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers. However, it shows significant thickness&#8208;dependent deterioration in the reports so far, making it challenging to obtain high&#8208;quality ultrathin TCO films. Here, a critical nucleation strategy (cns) is proposed, i.e., manipulating nucleation status that matches the intended film thickness, to break the spell. 30, 20, and 10 nm&#8208;thick cerium&#8208;doped indium oxide (ICO) films are successfully fabricated with electron mobility values of 127, 119, and 108 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively, which exceed twice that of the films with equal thickness obtained from the conventional solid&#8208;phase crystallization approach. A novel film growth mode for fabricating a TCO layer with mobility independent of film thickness is proposed. It is claimed that an appropriate weakly&#8208;crystallized as&#8208;deposited film is a prerequisite for obtaining favorable crystallites with largely suppressed scattering from grain boundaries, ionized impurities, and film surface. Further, by implementing our 10 nm&#8208;thick ICO film into silicon heterojunction architecture, a device efficiency of 25.16% is demonstrated, which is comparable to the reference cell using a 102 nm&#8208;thick ICO film. This manifests a 90% indium reduction, indicating significant potential for future optoelectronic applications, particularly for the terawatt&#8208;scale photovoltaic industry expansion.

Smart energy&#8208;saving devices&#160;with 3D structures operate passively and exhibit reversible solar heating and radiative cooling functions. These devices demonstrate superior performance in building thermal management through dual&#8208;mode operation and provide an optimized 3D energy management platform applicable across various angular environments. The fabricated 3D devices achieved energy savings of 7% and 6% for cooling and heating, respectively, and demonstrate global applicability.








Abstract
Conventional 2D thin&#8208;film&#8208;based energy&#8208;saving devices face limitations in controlling phase transition temperatures and in material selectivity. In contrast, 3D devices offer better temperature tunability and broader material options for surface coatings. However, existing designs still face challenges like limited deformation and asymmetric structures, hindering adaptation to varying sunlight incidence and azimuth angles. This study proposes symmetric 3D devices incorporating a shape memory alloy actuator, black paint for solar absorption, and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/Al2O3 composite as an RC film, exhibiting the following characteristics: i) reversible, continuously tunable 3D mechanical deformation between solar heating (SH) and radiative cooling (RC) modes via a temperature&#8208;responsive actuator; ii) autonomous operation without external power or manual intervention, ensuring energy&#8208;saving functionality; and iii) effective operation across diverse climates with durable, flexible, and adaptable design and adjustable transition temperatures for enhanced thermal responsiveness. Theoretical simulations confirm maximum cooling power reduction of 6.8% in summer and heating power reduction of 5.6% in winter. Performance evaluations under varying tilt angles and solar incidence, along with climate simulations across 15 global zones, validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the device for real&#8208;world applications. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, sustainable, energy&#8208;efficient solution for future architectural and environmental uses.

         <title>Multimaterial 3D Printing in Activating Bath Enables In Situ Polymerization of Thermosets with Intricate Geometries and Diverse Elastic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) strategy enables in situ polymerization of DCPD/COD&#8208;based inks within a fugitive reactive matrix where the activator in the matrix cures the printed filament. Cured ink properties are tunable through DCPD&#8208;COD comonomer ratios, yielding materials from stiff thermosets to soft elastomers. This approach allows fabrication of complex 3D structures containing high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio features as small as 5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Polydicyclopentadiene, p(DCPD), is a high&#8208;performance thermoset valued for its exceptional toughness, strength, and stiffness. When copolymerized with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD), its mechanical properties can be tuned from glassy to rubbery at room temperature. While frontal polymerization enables a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient route to 3D print DCPD&#8208;based materials, challenges such as ink shelf life and gravitational distortion, especially in direct ink writing of soft COD&#8208;rich formulations, must be considered. Here, a complementary chemical strategy is presented, embedded 3D printing, that enables localized in situ polymerization of printed DCPD/COD inks within a reactive support matrix. The matrix provides both physical support and a reservoir of chemical activator, which diffuses into the ink, activates a latent bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Ru precatalyst, and initiates ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Curing begins at the ink&#8211;matrix interface and propagates inward via diffusion, stabilizing the interface and preventing capillary&#8208;driven deformation regardless of the matrix yield stress. This approach eliminates the need for cold storage, external curing, or photoinitiation, significantly expanding the processing window. Using this method, diverse thermosetting and elastomeric architectures are fabricated with features as small as 5 &#181;m and aspect ratios of 100, including interlinked chains, shallow spherical shells exhibiting snap&#8208;through buckling, and hair&#8208;like fin arrays inaccessible through traditional techniques.

         <title>Dirac Fermion and Phonon Coupling Toward Giant Nernst Thermoelectric Performance in Topological Semimetal TaSb2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a giant ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) in the topological semimetal TaSb2&#8212;attributed to phonon&#8208;drag&#8208;induced enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in its electron&#8208;hole bands under conditions of high carrier mobility and electron&#8208;hole compensation. The resulting large Nernst thermopower and transverse power factor, driven by Dirac fermion and phonon coupling, represent the highest values reported within the XPn2 (X = Ta, Nb; Pn = As, Sb) family and establish a novel framework for designing high&#8208;performance transverse thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Electron and hole compensation and ultrahigh mobility of topological semimetals are becoming a guiding principle for designing thermoelectric materials with large Nernst effect, following which several topological semimetals are discovered. Here, beyond the desirable band features, the essential role of Dirac Fermion and phonon coupling is further highlighted for the exceptional Nernst effect. By investigating the topological semimetal of TaSb2 single&#8208;crystalline, a high Nernst thermopower of 1200 &#181;V K&#8722;1 and a giant Nernst power factor (PFN) of 8300 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 are observed, which are record values in the topological XPn2 (X = Ta, Nb; Pn = As, Sb) family. In particular, the Dirac Fermion and phonon coupling presented by the phonon&#8208;drag effect amplifies the respective Seebeck coefficients of electrons and holes and therefore enhances the Nernst thermopower. These results provide new insights for future design of novel materials with large Nernst effects and demonstrate the potential of TaSb2 for solid&#8208;state cooling and thermo&#8208;management at cryogenic temperatures.

         <title>Fully Synthetic Hydrogels Promote Robust Crypt Formation in Intestinal Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is broad interest in studying murine intestinal organoids (mIOs) crypts because of their link to disease. Historically these organoids have required the supplementation of laminin into the matrices they are cultured in to differentiate. Herein, a fully synthetic, rapid stress relaxing hydrogel is presented that promotes differentiation with laminin supplementation, enabling greater study of organoid crypt formation.









Abstract
Initial landmark studies in the design of synthetic hydrogels for intestinal organoid culture identify precise matrix requirements for differentiation, namely decompression of matrix&#8208;imposed forces and supplementation of laminin. But beyond stating the necessity of laminin, organoid&#8208;laminin interactions have gone largely unstudied, as this ubiquitous requirement of exogenous laminin hinders investigation. In this work, a fast stress relaxing, boronate ester&#8208;based synthetic hydrogel is used for the culture of intestinal organoids, and it is fortuitously discovered that unlike all other synthetic hydrogels to date, laminin does not need to be supplemented for crypt formation. This highly defined material provides a unique opportunity to investigate laminin&#8208;organoid interactions and how it influences crypt evolution and organoid function. Via fluorescent labeling of non&#8208;canonical amino acids, it is further shown that adaptable boronate ester bonds increase deposition of nascent proteins, including laminin. Collectively, these results advance the understanding of how mechanical and matricellular signaling influence intestinal organoid development.

         <title>Tandem Organic Solar Cells with 21.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>

A narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole central core, is fabricated to construct the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem organic solar cells (OSCs). By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution in the BAT&#8208;4F&#8208;based tandem OSC, a power conversion efficiency of 21.5% is achieved (certified as 21.2%), respectively, which marks the arrival of 21% era in the field of OSCs.2









Abstract
Tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) offer a promising strategy for enhancing light utilization and reducing energy loss, presenting significant potential in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) central core, is fabricated, which is designed for the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem OSCs. Systematic characterizations demonstrate that incorporating strong electron donating groups BTA into central core unit can narrow the bandgap and enhance the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. These improvements lead to increased current density and reduced voltage loss of single junction OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination and real incident light of the rear sub&#8208;cell. Inspiringly, BTA&#8208;4F&#8208;based single&#8208;junction and tandem OSCs achieve outstanding PCEs of 19.5% and 21.5% (Certified as 21.2%), respectively, which represents the milestone of 21% PCE in the field of OSCs. This study highlights the synergistic benefits of molecular design and implementation of tandem architecture as an effective strategy for enhancing photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

By fine-tuning the optical field distribution in the BAT-4F-based tandem OSC, a power conversion efficiency of 21.5% is achieved (certified as 21.2%), respectively, which marks the arrival of 21% era in the field of OSCs.2

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) offer a promising strategy for enhancing light utilization and reducing energy loss, presenting significant potential in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA-4F, featuring a 2-methyl-2H-benzotriazole (BTA) central core, is fabricated, which is designed for the rear sub-cell of tandem OSCs. Systematic characterizations demonstrate that incorporating strong electron donating groups BTA into central core unit can narrow the bandgap and enhance the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. These improvements lead to increased current density and reduced voltage loss of single junction OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination and real incident light of the rear sub-cell. Inspiringly, BTA-4F-based single-junction and tandem OSCs achieve outstanding PCEs of 19.5% and 21.5% (Certified as 21.2%), respectively, which represents the milestone of 21% PCE in the field of OSCs. This study highlights the synergistic benefits of molecular design and implementation of tandem architecture as an effective strategy for enhancing photovoltaic performance of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipidic Prodrug Co&#8208;Crystals: A Platform for Combination Therapy Targeting Fungal Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungal infections are worsened by biofilms and inflammation, reducing antifungal efficacy. Lipidic prodrug co&#8208;crystals (LPCCs) are developed that co&#8208;deliver antifungal and anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. LPCCs self&#8208;assemble, load drugs efficiently, and respond to biofilm environments. They inhibit biofilms and inflammation, modulate immunity, and restore tissue health in mice, offering a promising antifungal treatment strategy.








Abstract
Fungal infections are often complicated by biofilm formation and concurrent inflammation, limiting the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies. To address these challenges, we developed a novel hybrid drug delivery platform&#8212;lipidic prodrug co&#8208;crystals (LPCCs)&#8212;that combines the benefits of lipidic self&#8208;assembly and pharmaceutical co&#8208;crystallization. In this study, a lipidic prodrug is synthesized by linking catechol&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate with phenylboronic acid&#8208;modified bifonazole (Bfz), an antifungal agent, via boronate bonding. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures exhibit high drug&#8208;loading capacity (up to 85%) and are capable of co&#8208;crystallizing with anti&#8208;inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) through strong aromatic and ionic interactions. This dual&#8208;delivery system enables the controlled, site&#8208;specific release of both antifungal and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents in response to the acidic and oxidative microenvironment of fungal biofilms. LPCCs effectively prevent biofilm formation, eradicate mature biofilms, and enhance ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity. Mechanistically, LPCCs inhibit the NF&#8208;&#954;B/COX&#8208;2 pathway, reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, and promote an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. In a murine rectal candidiasis model, LPCCs significantly reduced fungal load, restored tissue integrity, and normalized immune and microbial environments. Our findings highlight LPCCs as a promising strategy for enhancing treatment efficacy, improving patient compliance, and overcoming the limitations of current antifungal therapies.

         <title>Unlocking the Essence of Lignin: High&#8208;Performance Adhesives That Bond via Thiol&#8208;Catechol Connectivities and Debond on Electrochemical Command</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lignin&#8208;inspired adhesive is presented, that combines the bonding strength of a structural adhesive with on&#8208;demand electrochemical debonding, enabled by biomimetic thiol&#8208;catechol connectivities. Voltage application of only 9 V facilitates electrochemical oxidation of catechols to quinones leading to guided detachment on command. This adhesive significantly improves repair and recycling strategies of e.g. microelectronic devices, which is demonstrated on a display prototype.








Abstract
The next generation of adhesives requires effective debonding capabilities that can be triggered on demand to enable advanced circular repair and recycling strategies. A new class of lignin&#8208;inspired, two&#8208;component (2K) structural adhesives offers bonding strengths of up to 20&#160;MPa and clean, on&#8208;command electrochemical debonding within 5&#8211;30 min. The debonding is induced by a distinct electrochemical oxidation of thiol&#8208;catechol connectivities (TCCs) within the entire adhesive network, enforcing rapid and clean adhesive failure on the cathodic substrate side. The TCC&#8208;functionalities are formed during curing by a thiol&#8208;quinone Michael&#8208;type polyaddition, reacting polyester&#8208;based trithiols with tris&#8208;quinones as lignin&#8208;inspired minimal building blocks. The structural adhesive can be fine&#8208;tuned by adjusting the formulation. The addition of carbon black and ionic liquids facilitates the desired electrochemical transformation of TCC&#8208;catechols to TCC&#8208;quinones. Applying only 9&#160;V for 5&#8211;30&#160;min, leads to clean debonding with 72&#8211;86% loss of shear strength. A comprehensive study of curing, bonding, and debonding behavior by rheological, spectroscopic, and electrochemical investigations reveals the debonding mechanism by correlating catechol oxidation to adhesive performance. The electrochemical debonding capability of TCC&#8208;structural adhesives is demonstrated in a functional prototype, where on&#8208;command detachment of a cover glass from a display device is achieved within 6.5 min.

         <title>Strong Coupling of NiOx and Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules via Inserted Reductant for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reducing molecules enhance coverage density of self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) by forming strong coupling with both NiOx and SAMs, thereby improving interfacial carrier extraction and suppressing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Hence, the as&#8208;proposed device obtains a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.34% and impressive operational stability (97.5% initial PCE retention rate for 1000&#160;h).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) deposited on nickel oxide (NiOx) are the basis for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, the dissolution and redeposition of SAMs caused by the perovskite precursors leads to leaky monolayers, resulting in perovskite degradation and reduced stability. Here, a novel method is reported to realize strong coupling between NiOx and SAMs via inserted reductant [9tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)] for an integrated NiOx&#8208;SAMs hole transport layer (HTL). TCEP reduces NiOx and in situ forms C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;Ni coordinated bond and O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9472;Ni hydrogen bond, while its &#8208;COOH is connected with SAM's &#8208;PO(OH)2 by phosphonate and hydrogen bond, which improve the compactness of SAMs, thereby strengthening hole extraction and lowering interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Simulation calculations demonstrate that the HTL strongly coupled by TCEP has a stronger adsorption energy, significantly improving device long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, the device based on integrated NiOx&#8208;SAMs HTL obtains a substantial efficiency of 26.34%. The devices maintain an impressive 97.5% of their original efficiency after 1000 h of operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination and 90.1% after 1000 h of thermal treatment at 85&#160;&#176;C in nitrogen atmosphere. This work offers new horizons for designing NiOx&#8208;based HTLs with high SAMs coverage for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Surface Compensation Principles of Soft&#8208;Lattice Nanocrystals toward High&#8208;Performance Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary phosphonium iodides with engineered steric configurations enable efficient surface compensation in perovskite nanocrystals, achieving high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes. Systematic evaluation reveals an inverse correlation between ligand steric bulk and device performance. Compact molecular geometries facilitate superior vacancy repair while reducing defect generation during surface reconstruction, establishing steric minimization as one of the critical molecular design principles for soft&#8208;lattice optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction in electroluminescent nanocrystals (NCs) requires a delicate balance between defect passivation and preserving lattice integrity. The structural damage is exacerbated in soft&#8208;lattice perovskite systems by the conventional ligand exchange process. Herein, a surface compensation paradigm is presented employing quaternary phosphonium iodides that synergistically repair halogen vacancies and stabilize the surface without perturbing the ionic lattice. These molecular compensators are delicately designed to be soluble in weak&#8208;polar solvents, enabling non&#8208;destructive ionic surface compensation. Besides, the sterically optimized ionic coordination suppresses defect generation during surface reconstruction. Resulting pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve remarkable electroluminescence performance with 28.8% peak external quantum efficiency, 1.75&#160;V sub&#8208;bandgap turn&#8208;on voltage, 30.1% power conversion efficiency, and 70.0 h operational half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, establishing new benchmarks for Rec.2020&#8208;compliant devices. The relationship between the steric factor of ligands and the compensation effect is further elucidated, providing molecular design principles for soft&#8208;lattice optoelectronic NCs.

Compact molecular geometries facilitate superior vacancy repair while reducing defect generation during surface reconstruction, establishing steric minimization as one of the critical molecular design principles for soft-lattice optoelectronic materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface reconstruction in electroluminescent nanocrystals (NCs) requires a delicate balance between defect passivation and preserving lattice integrity. The structural damage is exacerbated in soft-lattice perovskite systems by the conventional ligand exchange process. Herein, a surface compensation paradigm is presented employing quaternary phosphonium iodides that synergistically repair halogen vacancies and stabilize the surface without perturbing the ionic lattice. These molecular compensators are delicately designed to be soluble in weak-polar solvents, enabling non-destructive ionic surface compensation. Besides, the sterically optimized ionic coordination suppresses defect generation during surface reconstruction. Resulting pure-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve remarkable electroluminescence performance with 28.8% peak external quantum efficiency, 1.75&#160;V sub-bandgap turn-on voltage, 30.1% power conversion efficiency, and 70.0 h operational half-lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, establishing new benchmarks for Rec.2020-compliant devices. The relationship between the steric factor of ligands and the compensation effect is further elucidated, providing molecular design principles for soft-lattice optoelectronic NCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss in Perovskite Solar Cells via Ligand&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Dynamics Regulation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive (NH4SCN) ligands&#8208;assisted perovskite crystallization dynamics regulation strategy is investigated in this work. Which is proved to modulate both the nucleation and crystal growth progresses synchronously in virtue of the interaction affinity between NH4+/ SCN&#8208; ligands and the Pb&#9472;I framework or FA+. Ultimately, perovskite films with superior optoelectronic characteristics are achieved accompanied by a satisfactory performance of relevant PSCs.








Abstract
Despite the dazzling progress since the emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a significant ideal&#8208;reality discrepancy with respect to the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) still reminds the primarily weak parameter, inducing the limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) relative to its Shockley&#8208;Queisser theoretical limit. Eliminating the detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination centers enriched at the surface/grain boundaries of perovskite films is generally regarded as the key approaches to bridge this gap. Herein, a perovskite crystallization dynamic regulation template is conducted to ensure the realization of both rapid nucleation and suppressed crystal growth through the synchronous incorporation of SCN&#8722; and volatility NH4+ ligands. Thereby promoting the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with enlarged grain size, superior crystallinity, ordered surface texture and compensated residual strain. Notably, residual SCN&#8722; ligands detected in the buried interface of perovskite films is also inclined to serves as an interface passivators. In conjunction with the above analysis, desired perovskite films with decreased defect density and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination are acquired for the NH4SCN sample, leading to impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.13% with one of the lowest VOC losses among all reported p&#8208;i&#8208;n structure PSCs, reaching 96.13% of their theoretical VOC limit.

         <title>A Roadmap for Plasma&#8208;Enabled Electrocatalysis in Urea Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular plasma&#8212;electrochemical platform enables fully electrified urea synthesis from air and CO2 under ambient conditions. This Review integrates plasma oxidation, C&#9472;N coupling electrolysis, mechanistic insights, and techno&#8208;economic metrics into a roadmap for scalable, distributed, and renewable fertilizer production.








Abstract
Conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch/Bosch&#8211;Meiser routes link global urea production to fossil fuel&#8208;based ammonia, accounting for &#8776;2% of the world's energy use and &#8776;1.5% of CO2 emissions. A modular, fully electrified alternative is charted that cleaves the problem at its natural fault line: a non&#8208;thermal plasma first upgrades air to nitrate, then a CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;electrolyzer stitches the two C&#9472;N bonds of urea at ambient conditions. The lens is deliberately cross&#8208;disciplinary: every bottleneck is probed with the question, &#8220;Has a cognate field already cracked this?&#8221; If so, how can the solution be mirrored here? Plasma physics contributes to vibrational pumping, power modulated reactors, and in water quenching; CO2 and nitrate electro&#8208;reduction supply relay&#8208;site catalyst design, vacancy tuning, and pulsed&#8208;bias choreography; flow&#8208;battery engineering guides carbonate&#8208;resilient gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and zero&#8208;gap membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies (MEAs); and analytical chemistry adds two&#8208;probe assays that unmask false&#8208;positive amine/amide signals. Stitching these advances together, techno&#8208;economic modeling shows that sub&#8208;megajoule plasmas, &#8805;70% urea&#8208;selective in the electrolyzer, and renewable electricity (RE) at &#8804;3.5&#162; kWh&#8722;1 can push green urea below the fossil&#8208;based benchmark.

         <title>A Perspective on High&#8208;Entropy Oxides as Potential Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 43, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective comprehensively reviews the research progress of high&#8208;entropy oxides as electromagnetic wave absorbing materials from four aspects: high&#8208;entropy characteristics, crystal structure, synthesis methods, and elemental composition. The key scientific issues that urgently need attention at present and the development are proposed, aiming to provide insights for high&#8208;entropy oxides to become the next generation of promising electromagnetic wave absorbing materials.








Abstract
The escalating impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health and electronic device stability has driven intensive research into advanced electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) materials in recent decades. Among them, high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have evolved into increasingly popular research in the material field since they were first reported in 2015. They are particularly promising for EMA applications due to their remarkable tunability and almost infinite compositional flexibility. The advantages of HEOs as EMA material from four key aspects are systematically clarified: the intrinsic properties of the high&#8208;entropy system, crystal structure, compositional design, and synthesis strategies. A forward&#8208;looking view on the future development of HEOs in EMA is highlighted, demonstrating six crucial points: dielectric genes, high&#8208;throughput computational methods, material integration strategies, microstructural modulation, the high&#8208;entropy concept expansion, and functional expansion. This perspective offers theoretical insights and technological references to advance high&#8208;performance HEO research by systematically connecting the HEO family and EMA functionality.

         <title>Melt&#8208;Based Embedded Printing of Macroscopically&#8208;Conformal, Electro&#8208;Conductive and Elastomeric Patches for Improved Myocardial Infarction Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A melt&#8208;based embedded 3D printing platform is presented that solves the challenge of printing thermosetting elastomers, enabling direct fabrication of conductive, elastic poly(glycerol sebacate) structures and conformal cardiac patches as acellular implants for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is promising for engineering flexible cardiac patches for myocardial infarction repair due to its unique elasticity. However, its insulating nature and complex thermal curing process hinder existing 3D printing techniques from producing patches that recapitulate the mechanical, electrical, and anatomical features of native myocardium. Here, a melt&#8208;based embedded printing strategy enabling direct, freeform fabrication of thermosetting PGS architectures with in situ thermal curing is proposed. The viscoelastic matrix enables high&#8208;fidelity extrusion of PGS prepolymer into microscale filaments while providing temporary support for in situ curing of PGS elastomeric architectures with seamless interface fusion and mechanical stability. This platform further allows direct printing of electro&#8208;conductive cardiac patches using carbon nanotube&#8208;incorporated PGS that mimic ventricular curvature and mechanical anisotropy. Compared to pure PGS controls, the electro&#8208;conductive patches enhance cardiomyocyte maturation in vitro, evidenced by improved sarcomere organization, calcium handling, and electrical synchronization. In vivo, these acellular patches improve mechanical integration with host myocardium, promote vascularization, reduce inflammation, and preserve cardiomyocyte survival, collectively maintaining ejection fraction and attenuating adverse remodeling. This work, therefore, establishes a generalizable manufacturing strategy for printing thermosetting elastomeric constructs with integrated conductivity as acellular, mechanically and electrically functional patches for structural cardiac repair.

         <title>Reassessing Electrolyte Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Magnesium Batteries: Atomistic Structures and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent advances in non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for rechargeable magnesium batteries, focusing on chlorine&#8208;containing and chlorine&#8208;free systems. It highlights the interdependent relationship between electrolyte compositions, atomistic structures, and electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous magnesium (Mg) batteries have attracted considerable attention as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology, owing to the high Mg resource abundance and good safety. Nevertheless, the development of efficient non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes remains a critical challenge that hinders the practical deployment of Mg batteries. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advances, ongoing challenges, and future directions for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes in Mg batteries, emphasizing both chlorine&#8208;containing and chlorine&#8208;free electrolytes. Furthermore, it discusses how these electrolyte systems influence the Mg stripping/plating process, particularly in terms of compatibility with the Mg metal anode, and evaluates their electrochemical stability, including the applicable voltage window. Chlorine&#8208;containing electrolytes exhibit high ionic conductivities and reversibility but present challenges related to corrosion and limited electrochemical stability. In contrast, chlorine&#8208;free electrolytes offer a more eco&#8208;friendly alternative, though often with lower ionic conductivity and limited compatibility with Mg metal anodes. This review examines electrolyte design strategies, atomistic structures, and performance optimization to outline the advantages and drawbacks of each electrolyte type. Emerging methodologies for advanced electrolyte development are also discussed. This comprehensive analysis highlights the pivotal role of electrolyte innovation in realizing the full potential of non&#8208;aqueous Mg batteries and advancing sustainable, high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Giant Berry&#8208;phase&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Beam Translations in Strain&#8208;Engineered Semiconductor Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the Berry&#8208;phase effect, X&#8208;rays propagating in deformed crystals undergo large translations, interesting for X&#8208;ray optics applications. Here, the lattice expansion observed upon H irradiation of dilute&#8208;nitride semiconductors is exploited to engineer the deformation landscape of selectively hydrogenated GaAsN epilayers. Beam translations &gt;100&#160;&#181;m are subsequently observed and linked to specific deformation regions through the comparison with a dedicated model.








Abstract
The manipulation of light through its interactions with artificially structured media is a cornerstone of photonics. The rescaling of this concept to the X&#8208;ray realm&#8212;which will enable us to control X&#8208;ray light with the same precision routinely available in the visible/IR range&#8212;has so far been hindered by the inherent difficulty of realizing photonic structures with the sub&#8208;nanometric resolution dictated by X&#8208;ray wavelengths. A promising approach to this challenge is based on the so&#8208;called Berry&#8208;phase effect, the large beam translations undergone by X&#8208;ray photons propagating in a deformed crystal, due to the simultaneous presence of Berry curvatures in real and reciprocal space. In this work, the controlled crystal distortions required to rein in this effect are obtained by pairing the lattice expansion observed upon H irradiation of GaAsN with a spatially selective hydrogenation technique. The macroscopic beam translations measured here are striking manifestations of the Berry curvatures associated with the sub&#8208;nanometric lattice distortions induced by H incorporation. Through the comparison with a dedicated theoretical model, the individual translation branches observed in X&#8208;ray transmission can be traced back to specific deformation features present within the samples, establishing a predictive framework for the control of X&#8208;ray propagation in the fabricated structures.

         <title>Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Imaging: From Systemic Vasculature Visualization to Pathological Microenvironment Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic molecular design strategy that suppresses &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and reduces intramolecular charge transfer in the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl is developed to achieve record&#8208;high NIR&#8208;II quantum yield in aqueous nanoparticles for high&#8208;resolution dynamic mapping of vasculature and lymphatic networks and superior tumor/inflammation detection sensitivity.








Abstract
Highly emissive fluorescence probes are crucial for precise disease diagnosis. To overcome the persistent limitations of low quantum yield in near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) organic dyes, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen, TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl, has been strategically designed. By synergistically suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and minimizing intramolecular charge transfer, we engineered NIR&#8208;II nanoparticles that rank among the brightest organic probes reported (absolute &#934;PL = 0.9%). In vitro studies demonstrated that TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl nanoparticles exhibit exceptional colloidal stability and remarkable photostability. In vivo imaging displayed its high spatial resolution and prolonged tissue retention, enabling dynamic high&#8208;contrast visualization of systemic vasculature, cerebral microvasculature, and lymphatic networks. Remarkably, TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl nanoparticles show superior sensitivity in detecting tumor lesions in orthotopic 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice models and achieve precise spatial mapping of inflammatory regions in inflammatory bowel disease models, underscoring their transformative potential for clinical pathological diagnostics. This work establishes a molecular modulation paradigm for designing high&#8208;brightness organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, providing an advanced molecular tool for further clinical diagnostic applications.

         <title>Electroactive Organic Cage as Efficient Adsorbent and Ultrasensitive Transistor Sensor for Trace Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive organic cage can simultaneously fulfil two challenging tasks for high&#8208;efficient capture and ultrasensitive detection of trace radioactive iodine pollutants. It results in a record&#8208;high dynamic I2 vapor uptake of 1.28 and 5.16&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 dynamic I2 adsorption in solution. Fabricating it into a cage&#8208;based transistor sensor, it lowers the detection limit of I2 to 0.58 ppt, outperforming common spectroscopic methods by 106.








Abstract
Efficient capture and ultrasensitive detection of radioiodine from nuclear industrial waste and contaminated water are crucial for environmental safety, yet achieving both simultaneously with a single material remains challenging. Here, a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)decorated organic cage (TTFcage) is reported that serves as a high&#8208;performance adsorbent for trace iodine (I2) in both industrial off&#8208;gas and polluted water, and as a molecular cagebased organic field&#8208;effect transistor (cOFET) for ultrasensitive I2 detection. TTFcage shows strong I2 affinity through cooperative charge&#8208;transfer interactions of N and S sites, resulting in an ultrahigh I2 vapor uptake of 1.28&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 under &gt;150 &#176;C and &lt;150 ppmv of I2 conditions, 7.1&#160;times higher than industrial silver adsorbents. It also decontaminates iodine in flowing water below the secure criteria of World Health Organization (WHO, &lt;0.1&#160;ppm) with a high adsorption capacity of 5.16&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1. The electroactive TTF units impart tunable conductivity upon I2 binding, enabling an unreported cOFET sensor with a limit of detection (LoD) of I2 as low as 0.58&#160;ppt (&#8776;10&#8722;12&#160;M), exceeding conventional spectroscopic methods by 6&#160;orders of magnitude. Moreover, I2 adsorption and detection can be integrated into a miniaturized chip, providing a portable platform for on&#8208;site pollution treatment and synchronized environmental monitoring of radioiodine.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Afterglow of Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides for Multi&#8208;Dimensional Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a rationally designed Mn2+&#8208;doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is reported exhibiting dual&#8208;mode emission characteristics. The material demonstrates both UV&#8208;activated room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced long persistent luminescence. Leveraging these complementary photophysical properties, a multi&#8208;dimensional optical encryption platform is developed that operates across temporal, spatial, and energy domains, enabling sophisticated time&#8208;resolved information security applications.








Abstract
Organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials exhibiting room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have attracted growing attention for various time&#8208;resolved optoelectronic applications. To date, realizing intrinsically distinct RTP and LPL emissions within a single material system remains elusive, yet it is crucial for unlocking multifunctional applications such as multilevel optical encryption. Here, a Mn2+&#8208;doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is presented that exhibits bright yellow phosphorescence under UV excitation and a long&#8208;lasting red afterglow persisting for over 600 s under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These contrasting emission behaviors originate from distinct recombination pathways: triplet exciton emission from the organic ligand governs RTP, while LPL arises from Mn2+&#8208;centered emission. The latter is enabled by the thermally activated release of charge carriers trapped at radiation&#8208;induced defects. This excitation&#8208;dependent divergence in luminescence offers temporal and spectral control over optical signals, enabling a multidimensional time&#8211;space&#8211;energy encoded optical encryption platform. The findings introduce a pathway&#8208;engineered strategy for multi&#8208;mode phosphorescent materials, paving the way for further materials design for emerging intelligent optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a rationally designed Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is reported exhibiting dual-mode emission characteristics. The material demonstrates both UV-activated room-temperature phosphorescence and X-ray-induced long persistent luminescence. Leveraging these complementary photophysical properties, a multi-dimensional optical encryption platform is developed that operates across temporal, spatial, and energy domains, enabling sophisticated time-resolved information security applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials exhibiting room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have attracted growing attention for various time-resolved optoelectronic applications. To date, realizing intrinsically distinct RTP and LPL emissions within a single material system remains elusive, yet it is crucial for unlocking multifunctional applications such as multilevel optical encryption. Here, a Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is presented that exhibits bright yellow phosphorescence under UV excitation and a long-lasting red afterglow persisting for over 600 s under X-ray irradiation. These contrasting emission behaviors originate from distinct recombination pathways: triplet exciton emission from the organic ligand governs RTP, while LPL arises from Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-centered emission. The latter is enabled by the thermally activated release of charge carriers trapped at radiation-induced defects. This excitation-dependent divergence in luminescence offers temporal and spectral control over optical signals, enabling a multidimensional time&#8211;space&#8211;energy encoded optical encryption platform. The findings introduce a pathway-engineered strategy for multi-mode phosphorescent materials, paving the way for further materials design for emerging intelligent optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Efficiency Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries Enabled by Defect&#8208;Engineered Biomass Carbon and Dynamic Nickel Redox Mediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionothermal activation of eucalyptus waste constructs oxygen&#8208;rich confined domains, precisely generating carbon vacancies. These vacancies reconstruct pyridinic nitrogen coordination, redistributing electrons to balance *O/*OH adsorption&#8211;desorption and enhance ORR kinetics. Coupled with Ni&#8208;mediated self&#8208;oxidizing redox, reducing the voltage gap and stabilizing the interface, this synergy enables high&#8208;performance CZABs, achieving 82% energy efficiency and 77% after 400 h.








Abstract
Coupled zinc&#8208;air batteries (CZABs) are promising in future energy storage and conversion solutions because of their potential for enhanced energy efficiency and boosted power density. However, sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode remain a key challenge, leading to cycling instability and insufficient battery performance. In this study, a rational interfacial etching method is developed to fabricate nitrogen&#8208;doped and defect&#8208;rich carbon catalysts from the low&#8208;cost eucalyptus waste. The precise formation of carbon vacancies, driven by synergistic spatial confinement domains and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups exposed on eucalyptus precursors, promotes the reconstruction of pyridinic nitrogen (Py&#8208;N) coordination. This induces local electron redistribution, enhancing charge transfer efficiency at adjacent Py&#8208;N sites, and optimizing *O/*OH adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, thereby significantly boosting the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Additionally, the integration of self&#8208;adaptive Ni2+/Ni3+ redox pair into the cathode effectively mitigates the oxygen evolution reaction and thus reduces voltage delay by 0.12&#160;V. The resulting CZABs achieve 82% energy efficiency at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 77% after 400&#160;h, which is rarely reported. This work elucidates the intricate mechanism of defect formation during biomass pyrolysis and presents a scalable, cost&#8208;effective strategy for producing high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, offering a promising strategy toward advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Mechanical Metasurface Enabling Zero&#8208;Power&#8208;Consumption Thermal Management of Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective thermal management is essential for ensuring the reliability of electronic devices. In this paper, a zero&#8208;power&#8208;consumption, self&#8208;adaptive mechanical metasurface is implemented to provide efficient thermal management for multiple electronic devices, such as a mobile phone and a broadband antenna.








Abstract
Effective thermal management is essential for ensuring the reliability of electronic devices. However, conventional thermal management technologies often require significant space or consume substantial power, which limits system integration and alters the electromagnetic performance, including operating bandwidth and efficiency. Here, a zero&#8208;power&#8208;consumption, self&#8208;adaptive mechanical metasurface is introduced that provides dual&#8208;mode thermal management. Composed of liquid crystal elastomer and copper, the periodically arranged units harness a thermally driven strain mismatch between these materials to achieve temperature&#8208;dependent structural reconfiguration. This mechano&#8208;thermal transduction mechanism passively converts excess heat into mechanical energy, thereby providing efficient thermal management for multiple electronic devices in this experimental demonstration. As a proof of concept, by designing the deep&#8208;subwavelength unit cells of metasurface without perturbing the surface current distribution of a Vivaldi antenna, it is shown that the mechanical reconfiguration can be decoupled from electromagnetic functionality, thereby enabling the integration of adaptive thermal management with stable electromagnetic performance. This framework effectively combines multi&#8208;physics functionality, encompassing thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic domains. This work not only reveals a previously unexplored application for stimuli&#8208;responsive materials but also holds significant promise for various applications, including advanced communication and wearable systems.

         <title>Four&#8208;Dimensional Dynamic Multicolor Emission in MgGa2O4:Tb3+ Through Orthogonal Modulation of Excitation Wavelength, Time, Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic multicolor luminescence of MgGa2O4:Tb3+ across four dimensions of excitation wavelength, time, temperature, and pressure.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescence materials exhibiting multiple stimulus responses are highly favored in optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. However, this static luminescence under fixed stimuli remains vulnerable to replication. The development of dynamic multicolor luminescent materials offers an effective solution, yet integrating multidimensional dynamic luminescence within a single material remains challenge. Here, this work introduces Tb3+ capture centers into the self&#8208;activated luminescent host MgGa2O4&#8208;featuring an alternating layered structure and abundant defects&#8208;to construct efficient energy transfer channels. This design enables not only static multicolor luminescence dependent on concentration and interplanar spacing, but also, for the first time, stable dynamic multicolor luminescence modulated by four independent dimensions: excitation wavelength, time, temperature, and pressure. In particular, the time domain reveals dynamic photoluminescence with tunable evolution rates, as well as visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;band persistent luminescence. These unique optical properties provide strong potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and visual temperature/stress sensing. Moreover, this work proposes a 4D coupled dynamic encryption system that integrates self&#8208;destruction protection and memory fault&#8208;tolerance, thereby greatly reducing the risk of information leakage. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, opening new avenues for the design of multidimensional dynamic multicolor luminescent materials.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Enabled High In&#8208;Plane Anisotropy of Monolayer MoS2 Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a precise CVD method with in situ monitoring (OIRD) to fabricate centimeter&#8208;scale, aligned, crosstalked monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon arrays on sapphire. Unprecedented in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy (confirmed by RDS/Raman) and stark electrical contrast (parallel&#8208;to&#8208;perpendicular current ratio &#8776;63.2 at 30&#160;V), enabling polarized photodetection. Polarized TA spectroscopy further reveals the anisotropic carrier dynamics underlying the photoresponse.








Abstract
Researchers now successfully fabricate well&#8208;aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanowires and nanobelts. However, achieving efficient carrier transport perpendicular to the nanowire direction remains a significant challenge, which continues to limit their application in integrated polarization&#8208;sensitive devices. Based on the synergistic mechanism of precursor anisotropic diffusion and step&#8208;edge&#8208;guided growth, an effective chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach enabled by in situ coverage monitoring is developed to overcome existing limitations. By precisely terminating the growth process at its optimal stage, highly aligned and crosstalked monolayer MoS2 nanoribbons (NRs) are obtained. Crucially, these NRs demonstrate efficient current conduction along both the parallel and perpendicular directions, enabled by the inter&#8208;ribbon crosstalk structures. Reflection difference spectroscopy (RDS) and polarized Raman characterization confirm strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy within the arrays. Electrical measurements reveal a remarkably high parallel&#8208;to&#8208;perpendicular current ratio of up to 63.2 at 30&#160;V bias, enabling a distinct polarized light response. Furthermore, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy uncovers anisotropic carrier dynamics in the NR arrays. This work represents the first demonstration of mimicking the differential electrical transport behavior characteristic of intrinsically anisotropic materials using an otherwise isotropic TMD material system, opening new possibilities for anisotropic optoelectronics.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Liquid Metal Nanophotonic Platform for Color Display and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically reconfigurable nanophotonic platform is realized by combining electrowetting&#8208;actuated liquid metal and gold nanoantennas in a microfluidic system. Controlled movement of the liquid metal in the microfluidic channel leads to structural change of the nanophotonic resonators, which in turn induces drastic changes in their reflection spectra and colors. The demonstrated reconfigurable nanophotonic platform may find a wide range of display, imaging, and sensing applications.








Abstract
Dynamically tunable optical materials and device architectures are essential for future photonic technologies, yet conventional solid metals lack the intrinsic tunability required for advanced functionalities. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) present an appealing alternative thanks to their distinctive mechanical and optical properties; however, their practical integration in tunable photonic elements remains largely unexplored. Here, an electrochemically controlled nanophotonic platform is demonstrated that integrates a dynamically reconfigurable LM ground plane with gold nanoantenna arrays within a microfluidic system, enabling precise and reversible modulation of optical resonances across the visible to mid&#8208;infrared spectral ranges. By employing moderate operational voltages (1.5&#8211;3.0&#160;V), real&#8208;time tuning of high&#8208;resolution structural color patterns is achieved through nanoscale control of the interfacial gap between the LM and Au nanoantennas. This innovative platform facilitates electrically programmable, high&#8208;contrast color patterns suitable for dynamic optical displays, secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and imaging applications. Additionally, this platform enables tunable mid&#8208;infrared spectral responses, which may be utilized for chemical and biological sensing applications. This versatile integrated LM&#8208;based nanophotonic platform opens new paths toward multifunctional, actively tunable/reconfigurable photonic device and system technologies.

         <title>Liquid Metal Solvent Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Rhenium Nanoparticles with Ultrahigh Strength and Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid metal solvent strategy to synthesize high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles, where the liquid metal promotes the rapid diffusion and aggregation of refractory metal atoms is reported. Taking Re as an example, the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;crystal Re nanoparticles with highly symmetrical shape exhibit exceptional mechanical behaviors of ultrahigh strength and significant plastic deformability. 








Abstract
The unique properties of refractory metals, such as high melting point, high strength, and great corrosion resistance, qualify them as an intriguing option for harsh applications. However, internal defects and surface flaws inherent in currently prepared refractory metals compromise their mechanical properties, making them inadequate for practical applications. Here, a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated strategy enabling the preparation of single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles with a highly symmetrical shape is reported. Liquid metals provide a favorable solution environment that facilitates rapid diffusion and aggregation of refractory metal atoms, allowing them to self&#8208;rearrange into stable Wulff configurations. The exceptional mechanical properties of the synthesized single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles are highlighted by rhenium (Re) samples, which exhibit ultrahigh strength (up to 67.8&#160;GPa) exceeding that of any known metal and significant plastic deformability capable of retaining shape without cracking up to an 80% strain. This remarkable combination of mechanical properties arises from the synergistic effects of the highly symmetrical shape and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal structure. This strategy not only lays the groundwork for the controlled synthesis of high&#8208;quality refractory metals but also advances the fundamental understanding of their structure&#8208;property relationships for the rational design of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Chloride Ion Storage with Hierarchical Ternary Metal Hydroxides for Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free flow&#8208;through electrochemical system based on hierarchical FeCoNi&#8208;layered triple hydroxide nanosheets on porous nickel foam offers a high&#8208;capacity, energy&#8208;efficient solution for chloride ion removal. The system demonstrates superior desalination performance and remarkable cycling stability, with 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This work presents a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach for sustainable water purification, addressing the key challenges of traditional desalination technologies.








Abstract
The increasing demand for clean water and renewable energy drives the need for efficient chloride ion removal from saline water. Here, we present a membrane&#8208;free flow&#8208;through electrochemical system using hierarchical FeCoNi&#8208;layered triple hydroxide nanosheets grown directly on porous nickel foam (FeCoNi&#8208;LTH/NF). The ternary composition uniquely enhances chloride ion adsorption by modulating electronic structure and ion binding energy. The in situ electrode synthesis approach ensures direct, binder&#8208;free contact, enhancing charge transfer and ion storage. Consequently, the FeCoNi&#8208;LTH/NF electrode achieves outstanding chloride removal capacity (180.07 mg&#160;g&#8722;1), rapid adsorption rates, high energy efficiency, and exceptional stability (100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the potential of a hierarchical triple hydroxide electrode as a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and energy&#8208;efficient solution for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained 2D Bi2Ti2O7 for CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermally synthesized 2D Bi2Ti2O7 nanosheets display the asymmetric Bi&#8211;Ovac&#8211;Ti sites that create tensile strain, enhancing CO2 photoreduction through a distinct &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; electronic effect. This effect improved charge transfer and C&#9472;O bond cleavage, differing from the conventional Lewis acid&#8211;base mechanism.








Abstract
Although the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, such as CO, offers a sustainable path to carbon neutrality, the optimization of the charge separation and active site density remains challenging in conventional bulk photocatalysts. In this study, it is shown that atomically thin tensile&#8208;strained 2D layered Bi2Ti2O7 nanosheets (t&#8208;BT) possess high efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction. The tensile&#8208;strain&#8208;induced asymmetric Bi&#8211;Ovac&#8211;Ti sites enhance the directional charge&#8208;transfer pathway, concentrating photogenerated electrons at metallic active sites to achieve a charge separation efficiency of 91.5%. Additionally, these asymmetric sites laterally adsorb CO2 molecules, generating an electron &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; effect distinct from that of traditional Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, to synergistically optimize *COOH activation and *C&#9472;O bond cleavage, thereby accelerating CO2 conversion and CO desorption. Notably, t&#8208;BT produces CO at 31.06&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with &#8776;100% selectivity, outperforming the CO production rate of the unstrained bulk material (0.9&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This study highlights strain engineering in 2D pyrochlore architectures, revealing how defect&#8211;strain synergy overcomes conventional tradeoffs in photocatalyst design and promotes efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Molecular Architecture Encoded Stretchable Polyethylene Glycol Hydrogels and Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush molecular architecture prevents the crystallization of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) based polymers, enabling highly stretchable photocurable PEG hydrogels and elastomers for high&#8208;performance conductive solvent&#8208;free electrolytes at room temperature and for additive manufacturing of complex architectures and multi&#8208;material structures with seamless interface integration.








Abstract
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) networks are widely used in biomedical applications and are emerging as solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes for next&#8208;generation lithium batteries. Leveraging additive manufacturing technologies, such as digital light processing (DLP), PEG networks can be transformed into micro&#8208;architected metals and functional biomimetic vascular networks. However, developing stretchable PEG networks, let alone making them 3D printable, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, DLP printable, highly stretchable foldable bottlebrush PEG networks are reported. These networks are formed by rapid photopolymerization of low&#8208;cost commercial chemicals in ambient air. The bottlebrush architecture enables high molecular weight PEG network strands that do not crystallize and remain elastic without solvents at room temperature. Upon large deformation, the folded bottlebrush backbone unfolds to release stored length to enable extreme stretchability. The resulting hydrogels and elastomers exhibit tissue&#8208;like moduli ranging from &#8776;1 to &#8776;100 kPa and tensile breaking strains up to 1500%. The applications of bottlebrush PEG networks are demonstrated as matrices for highly stretchable and conductive solvent&#8208;free polymer electrolytes at room temperature (&#8776;900% strain and 1.2 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), as well as resins for DLP printing of complex architectures, cytocompatible organ&#8208;like geometries, functional devices, and multi&#8208;material structures with seamless interface integration. The developed photocurable bottlebrush PEG networks promise immediate applications in advanced (bio)manufacturing and beyond.

The applications of bottlebrush PEG networks are demonstrated as matrices for highly stretchable and conductive solvent-free polymer electrolytes at room temperature (&#8776;900% strain and 1.2 mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as resins for DLP printing of complex architectures, cytocompatible organ-like geometries, functional devices, and multi-material structures with seamless interface integration. The developed photocurable bottlebrush PEG networks promise immediate applications in advanced (bio)manufacturing and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Conductivity and Porosity of Interlayer for Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple Si/Carbon nanotube (CNT) interlayer with graded porosity and mixed ionic/electronic conductivity enables high&#8208;energy, safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. A dense LiSi layer, porous LiSi&#8211;CNT middle, and conductive CNT near the collector guide Li flux and electrons, suppress dendrites and sulfide&#8208;electrolyte decomposition, and ensure uniform plating/stripping, achieving room&#8208;temperature stability for 1800 cycles with 63.2% capacity retention.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions due to their high energy density and enhanced safety. However, persistent challenges such as dendrite formation, solid electrolyte (SE) decomposition, and unstable interfaces impede the utilization of lithium metal anodes. In this study, a triple Si/Carbon nanotube (CNT) interlayer featuring meticulously engineered gradients in conductivity and porosity is introduced. Thus, the designed interlayer consists of low electronic conductivity and high ionic conductivity with a densely low&#8208;porosity structure at the SE interface, balanced ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity in the porous middle layer, and high electronic conductivity adjacent the current collector. This strategic configuration effectively suppresses dendrite growth, minimizes SE degradation, and promotes uniform lithium deposition. Experimental results demonstrate that the triple Si/CNT interlayer achieves an initial Coulombic efficiency of 95.1% and maintains approximately 99.9% cycling efficiency over 150 cycles in half&#8208;cell tests. Notably, full&#8208;cell evaluations with an Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibit outstanding performance, delivering a capacity retention of 85.2% after 500 cycles and demonstrating long&#8208;term cycling stability up to 1800 cycles, alongside superior rate capabilities (85.2% at 2C, 76.3% at 5C, and 65.2% at 10C). These results highlight the efficacy of gradient&#8208;structured interlayers in enabling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;cycling ASSLMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Compaction Spherical Carbon with Tunable Rich Pore Structures for Efficient Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pre&#8208;pore engineered strategy was presented to tune pore structure of spherical hard carbon to balance sodium storage volume and compaction density. The obtained hard carbon achieves high initial Coulombic efficiency and simultaneous gains in gravimetric and volumetric capacities under high compaction. Multi&#8208;scale analysis clarifies how microscale electrochemistry, mesoscale packing, and fabrication methods dictate low&#8208;potential intercalation and pore&#8208;filling behaviors in lab&#8208;made versus practical electrodes.








Abstract
Hard carbon, owing to its tunable pore structure, is emerges as a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and holds a great potential to improve low&#8208;potential plateau capacity&#160;&#160;for boosting the energy density of full cells. However, a key challenge for large&#8208;scale SIBs applications is the trade&#8208;off between increasing sodium storage pore volume and maintaining high compaction density. Herein, a pre&#8208;pore engineering strategy is employed to fabricate high&#8208;compaction&#8208;density spherical hard carbon with tunable pore structures, realizing simultaneous enhancement of gravimetric and volumetric capacities. Importantly, it is found that pore structure regulation profoundly affects performance across multiple scales. Microscopically, adjusting pore structure alters intrinsic electrochemical properties, with a reversible capacity of 375.40 mAh g&#8722;1 and initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.1%. At the mesoscale, monodisperse spheres reduce packing voids and improve compaction. As a result, even under high compaction, the anode maintains a high reversible capacity of 359.49 mAh g&#8722;1 and exhibits an excellent volumetric capacity of 390.30 mAh cm&#8722;3. The assembly of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell further demonstrates its practical potential. In addition, fabrication methods determine electrode structure and sodium storage at the macroscopic scale, leading to clear differences in low&#8208;potential intercalation and pore&#8208;filling behaviors between lab&#8208;made and practical electrodes.

         <title>Bicontinuous Structure Mediated Microstructural Engineering of Hard Carbon for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microstructure of the hard carbon is modified by introducing an ordered bicontinuous mesoporous structure. The layer spacing of short&#8208;range ordered crystalline graphite regions is enlarged, and more active sites are generated. Hard carbon with a bicontinuous mesoporous structure achieves a specific capacity of 80 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 100&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising energy storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, including high irreversible capacity loss during initial cycles, poor rate performance, and structural instability. Here, a bicontinuous mesoporous hard carbon&#160;with a single primitive (SP) microstructure (coined SP&#8211;HC) is introduced that addresses these limitations through microstructural engineering. This SP&#8211;HC design increases the density and accessibility of Na+ storage sites, enhances carbon disorder, and expands interlayer spacing, leading to improved sodium storage capacity and kinetics. The 3D continuous meso&#8208;channels enable rapid Na+ transport, achieving an exceptional rate performance of 172 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 (full charge in 1 min). Remarkably, the SP&#8211;HC anode exhibits unprecedented cycle stability, retaining a high capacity of 80 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 100&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g&#8722;1, which represents the best cycle stability reported for hard carbon&#8208;based anodes of SIBs. This study provides an insight into the critical role of microstructural engineering in optimizing electrochemical storage of hard carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Rainbow Photonic Crystals: Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbohydrate Bottlebrushes Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color reflective 1D photonic crystals, capable of a tunable, responsive, and reversible color with high repeatability, are created from the self&#8208;assembly of carbohydrate&#8208;based brush block copolymers (BR01&#8208;04).








Abstract
Tunable and responsive photonic crystal systems are the subject of great research interest owing to their ability to actively respond to chemical, physical, biological, and other external stimuli. In this study, a new series of well&#8208;defined and novel carbohydrate&#8208;based bottlebrush copolymers are introduced, exhibiting narrow molecular weight (Mn) distributions in the range of 823.5 to 1455.0&#160;kDa. These bottlebrushes self&#8208;assemble into 1D photonic crystals (1D&#8208;PCs), and their self&#8208;assembly in lamellae structures is investigated using a wide range of techniques. The 1D&#8208;PCs formed from different bottlebrushes display a full spectrum of colors, ranging from colorless to rainbow colors, including blue, green, orange, and red, effectively spanning the entire UV&#8211;vis range. Remarkably, a very fast (a few seconds) change in the color is obtained simply by different solvent, a consequence of the lamellae domain swelling. This demonstrates the impressive tunability, fast responsiveness, and reversibility of these systems. Furthermore, by mixing the bottlebrushes with small carbohydrates, their optical properties can be further modified, achieving a red shift in reflective colors from orange to red. This approach provides a flexible strategy for tailoring the optical characteristics of photonic crystals without the need for synthesizing new carbohydrate&#8208;based bottlebrushes, thus offering a versatile platform for controlling their properties.

         <title>Monolithic 3D Integration of Vertical Memory with Phototransistor for Near&#8208;Sensor Cryptography and Homomorphic Data Searching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing security threats require neuromorphic hardware to move beyond biological mimicry and embed cryptographic capabilities within sensory systems. This work introduces a multifunctional wafer&#8208;scale monolithic 3D architecture that integrates quantum dot&#8208;sensitized phototransistors with vertical memories. By incorporating near&#8208;sensor cryptographic engines with homomorphic associative memory, the M3D platform addresses critical security gaps in neuromorphic systems operating within resource&#8208;constrained edge environments.








Abstract
Inspired by the human retina, retinomorphic systems achieve efficient near&#8208;sensor processing by tightly integrating sensing, memory, and computing. However, unlike biological vision, which evolved without selective pressure for data confidentiality, artificial edge systems face critical security demands. Therefore, next&#8208;generation hardware must extend beyond biological mimicry by combining bio&#8208;inspired efficiency with cryptographic capabilities. Here, a compact, multifunctional wafer&#8208;scale monolithic 3D (M3D) architecture is proposed for secure in&#8208;memory processing of optically acquired visual data. Integrating quantum dot&#8208;sensitized phototransistors with stacked high&#8208;density vertical resistive random&#8208;access&#160;memories (VRRAMs) provides multi&#8208;domain entropy sources, generating physical unclonable function (PUF) keys with &#8776;50% inter&#8208;device variability. Multi&#8208;layer encryption using functionally independent PUF keys enhances cryptographic resilience through key diversity. Concurrently, M3D ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (TCAM) array, implemented with wide&#8208;bandgap IGZO transistors, achieves high sensing margin (&#8776;1.58 &#215; 105), along with 9.61&#215; area efficiency and 6.25&#215; energy&#8208;delay product improvements over planar designs. Notably, M3D sensory and TCAM systems support near&#8208;sensor hashing and in&#8208;memory Hamming distance computation directly on encrypted data, enabling application&#8208;specific homomorphism with a 94.1% similarity preservation rate. Comparable classification accuracy for plaintext and encrypted hash inputs further underscores the potential of M3D&#8208;integrated platforms for secure, privacy&#8208;preserving machine vision at the edge.

         <title>Full Life Cycle Deicing and Efficient Anti&#8208;Icing Surface on Polymers with Triple Thermal Conversion Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic graphene@NiO/Ni surface on polymers with efficient anti&#8208;icing and photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/magnetothermal deicing capabilities is proposed. Employing different deicing strategies at various stages endows it with full life cycle deicing functionality. This surface is patternable, applicable to various substrates, and scalable, offering guidance for designing and fabricating full life cycle deicing materials.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electrothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for anti&#8208;icing and deicing, but their deicing ability often degrades with abrasion, thus failing to achieve full life cycle deicing. Herein, a superhydrophobic graphene@NiO/Ni&#160;surface on polymers with triple thermal conversion capability for efficient anti&#8208;icing/full life cycle deicing is prepared using laser activation, electroless plating, and electroplating. The hierarchical micro/nano structures of the uppermost graphene@NiO endow the surface with excellent hydrophobicity (162.9&#176; &#177; 2.3&#176;), delayed icing (1377.7 &#177; 180.3 s), photothermal deicing (150.0 &#177; 11.5 s), electrothermal deicing (141.3 &#177; 11.7 s), and mechanical robustness. The presence of the internal Ni layer results in the surface with superior magnetothermal deicing capability (41.0 &#177; 4.0 s). Importantly, prolonged use or abrasion can destroy the upper graphene@NiO layer, while the inner Ni layer remains unaffected. Consequently, the hydrophobicity and photo&#8208;/electrothermal deicing performance of the surface degrade after abrasion, but the magnetothermal deicing capability is enhanced. Employing different deicing methods at various stages endows the graphene@NiO/Ni surface with full life cycle deicing capability. The graphene@NiO/Ni surface is patternable, scalable, and compatible with various substrates, demonstrating successful applications in roofs and transmission lines. The method provides guidance for the design and preparation of full life cycle deicing materials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Terraced Stacking Engineering in Moir&#233; Ferroelectric Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; ferroelectricity promises ultracompact electronics but is hindered by topological constraints and complex polarization evolution. This work introduces a boundary confinement strategy to disrupt topological restrictions and achieve precise domain control. Through this strategy, stacking configurations and domain walls are directly visualized, enabling nonvolatile polarization switching. These findings elucidate the structure&#8208;polarization relationship, advancing the design of functional moir&#233; ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Emergent moir&#233; ferroelectricity, capable of realizing ferroelectricity down to the atomic scale, holds transformative promise for ultracompact electronics. However, directly visualizing the stacking&#8208;engineered interfacial ferroelectric phase is inherently difficult due to the intricate domain network involving overlapping lattice structures and complex polarization evolution. Moreover, the topological nature of the network inherently restricts nonvolatile switching, posing a fundamental barrier to practical implementation. In this work, a controlled boundary confinement engineering is proposed to disrupt topological constraints and enable precise domain engineering in moir&#233; superlattices. Utilizing scanning probe microscopy and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, atomic&#8208;resolution observation of the WSe2 stacking configuration is achieved, including R&#8208; (sliding ferroelectricity), H&#8208;stacking, and domain walls with broken C3 symmetry, from a cross&#8208;sectional perspective. Nonvolatile polarization switching is observed due to the elimination of nodes&#8217; pinning effects and the freedom of domain wall motion. The findings clarify the relationship between atomic structure and polarization distribution in the moir&#233; system, providing crucial insights for the design and manipulation of moir&#233; ferroelectrics in functional devices.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal Conductivity in Low Dielectric Polybutadiene via a Liquid Crystal Ordering Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal molecule is designed and synthesized with triphenyl mesogen and styrene end groups, which can cross&#8208;link in polybutadiene to form a network bearing LC polymers. This polymer with orderly&#8208;arranged structures exhibits an enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity, while displaying excellent dielectric properties with a low Dk and Df.








Abstract
Hydrocarbon polymers are ideal dielectric materials in microelectronic industry due to their extraordinarily low dielectric constant (Dk) and dielectric loss (Df). However, a challenge remains in improving their intrinsic thermal conductivity. This work establishes a novel method to develop hydrocarbon polymers with enhanced thermal conductivity by a liquid crystal (LC) ordering effect. An LC molecule is designed with triphenyl mesogen and styrene end groups (ST38), cross&#8208;linking in polybutadiene to form an LC polymer (ST38PB). The exploration of LC arrangement reveals that the formation of well&#8208;ordered LC domains is induced by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of triphenyl group, with its orientation being fixed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The LC domains demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, maintaining their structural integrity even at 260&#160;&#176;C. ST38PB exhibits an enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of 0.62&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, which is 3.4 times that of pristine polybutadiene. Meanwhile, it displays excellent dielectric properties (Dk = 2.40, Df = 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 at 10&#160;GHz). The use of ST38PB as thermal management materials for chip cooling and dielectric substrates for printed circuit boards is investigated. The findings confirm its promising potential for applications, and this strategy can be further extended to develop other LC&#8208;based thermally conductive polymers for demanding high&#8208;temperature applications.

The new Cu&#8208;containing MOF (Me2NH2)(CuICl2)@[Cu4(INA)4Cl2O]&#183;1.5dmf (3) contains a cation and an anion as guests and shows UV&#8208;near&#8208;mid&#8208;IR absorption and near&#8208;IR emission. MOF 3 shows gas&#8208;solid reactivity in the presence of NH3 and HCOOH to yield two new 3D MOF. In HCl and CH3COOH, MOF 3 forms two copper dimers, but it is stable in H2SO4, H3PO4, triethylamine, acetone, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile vapors.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that react spontaneously and selectively with gases or vapors are useful in separation and purification processes, but are very scarce since only a few MOFs are capable of undergoing structural transformations. Simultaneous incorporation of cations and anions in a MOF is, as far as is known, never been observed. Here a new MOF: (Me2NH2)(CuICl2)@[CuII4(INA)4Cl2O]&#183;1.5dmf (3) (INA = isonicotinate, dmf = N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylformamide) is presented that simultaneously incorporates Me2NH2+ cations and CuCl2&#8722; anions. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, MOF 3 is the first transition metal&#8208;based near&#8208;IR active MOF. A systematic reactivity study with highly reactive gases and vapors shows that, in the presence of NH3, MOF 3 presents a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to single crystal transformation into [Cu(INA)(OH)]&#183;H2O (4&#8208;NH3), a 3D MOF containing unprecedented [Cu(&#181;3&#8208;OH)]nn&#8211; chains. With HCl or HCOOH vapors, MOF 3 shows a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization structural transformation into (HINA)2[Cu2Cl6(H2O)2] (5&#8208;HCl) or the 3D MOF (Me2NH2)[Cu(HCOO)3] (6&#8208;For). In contrast, MOF 3 remains stable under vapors of H2SO4, H3PO4, Et3N, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, and pyridine. Theoretical calculations confirm the spontaneous nature of these transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the reduction of CuII to CuI in the host helps to explain such exceptional optical properties.

         <title>Observation of Topological Chirality Switching Induced Freezing of a Skyrmion Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Lorentz Transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that in the insulating van der Waals ferromagnet, CrBr3, a magnetic field can cause Bloch skyrmionic bubbles to spontaneously switch their chirality. As achiral type&#8208;II bubbles are an intermediate state, the bubbles rapidly elongate and shrink when switching, thereby inducing a freezing of the overall bubble lattice. The control over skyrmion chirality and order shown here can allow the creation of designer skyrmion crystals for utilization in unconventional computing.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected quasi&#8208;particles with a well&#8208;defined chirality. Control over their chirality is proposed as an additional feature for encoding data bits or as qubits in quantum computing due to their high efficiency and stability against achiral magnetic textures. Here it is shown that an in&#8208;plane magnetic field can be utilized to reshape the energy barriers between different skyrmionic bubbles (e.g., Bloch type, type&#8208;II) enabling spontaneous chirality fluctuations with a frequency that increases with the strength of the in&#8208;plane field. The insulating van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 is used as an archetypal system for low damping, reduced energy dissipation and a high number of magnetic phases to capture the chirality dynamics in real time through cryo&#8208;Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. It is observed that the interplay between the intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane field biased the chirality dynamics, favoring one handedness over the other. A remarkable consequence of the spontaneous chirality switching mechanism is that it induces a freezing (or crystallization) process in the skyrmion lattice. As the bubbles fluctuate between Bloch and type&#8208;II they elongate and shrink parallel to the in&#8208;plane field. Subsequently, the overall lattice crystallizes along the in&#8208;plane field direction, inducing a phase transition from a disordered liquid state to a hexatic phase where skyrmions are highly ordered resembling that of a solid. The results indicate chirality as an active element in the creation of topologically protected skyrmion crystals unveiling pathways toward chiral spintronic device platforms with tunable embedded&#160;configuration.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Chambered Branches of Hollow Nanoreactors Drive Spatiotemporal Regulation of *CO Intermediate for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a multi&#8208;chambered branched hollow nanoreactor (HoNR) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 photoreduction to CH4. The unique architecture regulates *CO intermediate coverage, promoting key *CH3O formation and achieving a high CH4 production rate of 215.5 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 92% electron selectivity without noble metals, offering a novel paradigm for efficient cascade photocatalysis.








Abstract
The high&#8208;calorific value and gas infrastructure compatibility of methane (CH4) position it as a key target in artificial CO2 photoreduction. However, the challenge of manipulating the surface coverage of *CO intermediate on catalysts significantly impedes the efficiency and selectivity of CH4 production during the eight&#8208;electron reduction process. Here, a hollow nanoreactor (HoNR) photocatalyst (hS&#8208;ZnSe/CdSe) with multi&#8208;chambered branches is demonstrated, achieving efficient and selective CH4 production under visible light. In situ DRIFTS reveals that the branched mesoporous shell can effectively regulate the dispersion and concentration of *CO intermediate, thereby promoting methoxy (*CH3O) formation, which is a significantly kinetic determinant of CH4 generation. The HoNR photocatalyst demonstrates a superior CH4 production of 215.5 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with an electron selectivity of 92%, which surpasses most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts, especially without using any noble metal cocatalyst. Moreover, the relationship between intermediate diffusion kinetics and final product selectivity in complex geometries cavities is quantitatively established via systematic simulation. This work revolutionarily leverages chamber&#8208;branched topological architectures to drive spatiotemporally coupled cascade reactions, establishing a potential paradigm for achieving high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis.

         <title>Literature on the Synthesis of Modulator&#8208;Assisted Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MA&#8208;COFs): A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulators play a pivotal role in steering covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) crystallization by slowing rapid polycondensation and enabling error correction during framework growth. Acting as competitive binders and capping agents, they regulate nucleation, suppress uncontrolled aggregation, and direct anisotropic crystal growth. This modulator&#8208;assisted strategy (MA&#8208;COFs) enhances long&#8208;range order, structural integrity, and tailored porosity compared to unmodulated systems. Residual modulators within COFs can further influence surface chemistry and open avenues for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Thus, modulators emerge as powerful kinetic controllers to bridge the gap between fast reactions and high&#8208;quality crystalline COFs.








Abstract
Covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) owe their remarkable efficiency and versatility to an array of superior structural attributes, including crystallinity, surface area, crystal size, pore distribution, and stability. Although myriad methods have sought to enhance these traits, a singular breakthrough emerged from our research: the strategic use of a lone modulator that elevates all these properties, yielding high&#8208;quality Modulator&#8208;Assisted COFs (MA&#8208;COFs). By deftly slowing monomer incorporation during synthesis, modulators orchestrate the creation of exquisitely ordered crystalline structures, amplify surface area, and foster larger, more resilient crystal domains. Beyond this, they refine pore distribution and fortify stability, unveiling a suite of extraordinary physical and chemical properties. The careful selection and optimization of modulators prove pivotal, directly shaping COF performance and integrity. This review meticulously explores the transformative influence of modulators in COF synthesis, shedding light on mechanisms that drive structural advancements and pinpointing critical efficacy factors. Such strategic deployment not only revolutionizes COF synthesis but also magnifies its potential across diverse scientific and industrial realms. Ultimately, these insights affirm modulators as essential instruments for sculpting COFs of unmatched performance and durability, charting new paths in catalysis and energy storage.

         <title>Nanomaterials Reinforced Antifouling Coatings: From Strategic Design to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances and emerging trends in antibacterial nanomaterials employed as surface coatings, emphasizing rational design strategies to enhance bactericidal performance and stability. Distinctive characteristics and interfacial engineering methodologies of nanocoatings tailored for combating marine biofouling, microbial corrosion, and biomedical infection are systematically discussed. Current challenges and future opportunities are also outlined for fostering economic viability and commercialization.








Abstract
Diverse microorganisms routinely organize into biofilms, posing a persistent threat to ecological contamination, industrial dysfunction, and public health. Engineered antibacterial nanomaterials, achieving several orders of magnitude reduction in bacterial viability, have emerged as broad&#8208;spectrum agents that suppress bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation while presenting a lower risk of resistance development. Embedding nanomaterials or creating nanostructures within surface coatings constitutes an effective, economical, and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for long&#8208;term biofouling mitigation in complex biological environments. Rational interfacial engineering enables mechanically robust and durable antifouling coatings on diverse substrates, unlocking applications across biomedical, environmental, and energy sectors. This review summarizes a comprehensive understanding of designing nanomaterial&#8208;integrated antifouling coatings (NACs) that correlates interfacial engineering with nano&#8208;microbe interactions. First, an overview of primary antibacterial nanomaterials employed in functional coatings, detailing fundamental properties, and antifouling mechanisms, is provided. Then, the principles of interfacial engineering for NACs are explored, emphasizing the structure&#8208;activity relationships that enhance antifouling activity, mechanical integrity, and durability. Emerging trends in the deployment of NACs for marine antifouling, antimicrobial corrosion protection, and biomedical use are subsequently highlighted. Finally, fundamental and practical challenges facing targeted NAC architectures are discussed, and perspectives for future research that bridge the gap between nanomaterial characteristics and macroscopic antifouling performance are offered.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Engineered Insulating Polymer Distribution Enables High&#8208;performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering insulating polymer side chains to regulate compatibility, chain diffusivity, and docking position within components, their spatial distribution is precisely controled in active layers. This enables decoupling of photovoltaic and mechanical properties at high PMMA additive loading through its dual functionality, namely forming entangled networks within PM6 amorphous regions for stress dissipation and enhancing crystalline ordering for efficient stretchable organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) face a critical efficiency&#8208;stretchability trade&#8208;off that limits wearable applications. Here, a breakthrough molecular design strategy employing side&#8208;chain&#8208;engineered insulating polymers&#8212;poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBMA)&#8212;as multifunctional additives to simultaneously enhance electronic and mechanical properties is presented. Through synergistic control of compatibility, chain diffusivity, and docking position with PM6/Y6 components, PMMA selectively distributes in the amorphous regions of the PM6 donor while promoting molecular packing in crystalline regions, enabling dual stress&#8208;dissipation networks and efficient charge transport pathways. As a result, the rigid 10PMMA (with 10 wt.% PMMA) devices achieve a record 19.01% power conversion efficiency (PCE), while maintaining 18.53% PCE (only 2% loss) for the rigid 20PMMA (with 20 wt.% PMMA) devices. More remarkably, the stretchable 20PMMA devices exhibit exceptional mechanical robustness with 10.8% fracture strain (2.2&#8208;fold improvement) and 87% PCE retention after 100 stretching cycles (10% strain), far surpassing the control devices (50% retention). The work establishes fundamental design principles for insulating polymer additives in is&#8208;OPVs, demonstrating how molecular control over micro&#8208;/nanoscale distribution can simultaneously optimize electronic and mechanical properties. These findings provide a universal materials platform for high&#8208;performance stretchable electronics, particularly for next&#8208;generation wearable energy technologies where both efficiency and durability are paramount.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azolate Framework&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon Nanocomposite Hydrogels Shielding Material with Tunable Dynamic Bonding&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This image demonstrates a multifunctional Fe@C/TPS nanocomposite hydrogel that concurrently offers enhanced ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and 56.97 dB EMI shielding in the X&#8208;band with rapid strain sensing. The hydrogel, enabled by a water&#8208;ethylene glycol solvent, functions at low temperatures and is self&#8208;reparable, recovering over 92% of its shielding effectiveness after mechanical damage.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising candidates for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in flexible and wearable electronics, yet their practical implementation remains hindered by low&#8208;temperature freezing and mechanical fragility. Although organohydrogels can enhance anti&#8208;freezing performance, their compromised conductivity often reduces shielding efficiency. Here, a multifunctional Fe@C/TPS nanocomposite hydrogel engineered through the incorporation of nitrogen&#8208;rich azolate framework&#8211;derived porous carbon is reported. The introduction of these nanomaterials simultaneously enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness through strong interfacial interactions. As a result, the hydrogel achieves an outstanding EMI shielding effectiveness of 56.97&#160;dB in the X&#8208;band, alongside rapid strain response (response time: 200&#160;ms, GF = 4.7). Remarkably, stable shielding and sensing performance are maintained even under harsh conditions, including &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 60% tensile strain, owing to the binary water&#8211;ethylene glycol solvent system that sustains a robust conductive network. Moreover, the dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions impart excellent self&#8208;healing behavior, enabling over 92% recovery of the original shielding efficiency after mechanical damage.

         <title>Synergistic Material&#8208;Interface Engineering: Unlocking Superior Performance in PbSe Thermoelectric Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic material&#8208;interface engineering strategy combining light Te alloying, trace Bi doping, and MgNi+Cu multilayer contacts unlocks superior thermoelectric performance in PbSe. The optimized modules exhibit an average ZT &gt;1.0 (300&#8211;773 K), 9.5% conversion efficiency, and a maximum cooling temperature difference of &#8776;63 K, enabling cost&#8208;effective power generation and thermoelectric cooling.








Abstract
The scarcity of tellurium (Te) critically restricts the large&#8208;scale deployment of advanced thermoelectric technologies. Here, Te&#8208;free PbSe is demonstrated as a cost&#8208;effective alternative for both power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling through crystal growth, a two&#8208;step compositional optimization, and multilayer interface engineering. Light Te alloying (&lt;1%) effectively suppresses lattice thermal conductivity while preserving high carrier mobility, and subsequent trace Bi substitution (&lt;0.2&#8240;) optimizes carrier concentration without degrading carrier mobility, yielding a high power factor of &#8776;37.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 and excellent thermoelectric performance (ZT&#8776;0.6 at 300&#160;K and a peak ZT&#8776;1.3 at 773&#160;K). Furthermore, replacing conventional Ni contacts with MgNi+Cu multilayers reduces interfacial resistivity by more than twofold. Benefiting from these advances, a segmented leg with an average ZT above 1.0 over 300&#8211;773&#160;K achieves a conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.5%, while a 7&#8208;pair module delivers a maximum cooling temperature difference of &#8776;63.2&#160;K. These results establish PbSe as a cost&#8208;effective and competitive candidate for high&#8208;performance thermoelectric power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling across wide operating temperatures.

Here, Te-free PbSe is demonstrated as a cost-effective alternative for both power generation and solid-state cooling through crystal growth, a two-step compositional optimization, and multilayer interface engineering. Light Te alloying (&amp;lt;1%) effectively suppresses lattice thermal conductivity while preserving high carrier mobility, and subsequent trace Bi substitution (&amp;lt;0.2&#8240;) optimizes carrier concentration without degrading carrier mobility, yielding a high power factor of &#8776;37.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent thermoelectric performance (&lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;0.6 at 300&#160;K and a peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;1.3 at 773&#160;K). Furthermore, replacing conventional Ni contacts with MgNi+Cu multilayers reduces interfacial resistivity by more than twofold. Benefiting from these advances, a segmented leg with an average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; above 1.0 over 300&#8211;773&#160;K achieves a conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.5%, while a 7-pair module delivers a maximum cooling temperature difference of &#8776;63.2&#160;K. These results establish PbSe as a cost-effective and competitive candidate for high-performance thermoelectric power generation and solid-state cooling across wide operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional 2D&#8208;Conjugated BDT Polymer Interlayer Enables Over 20% Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;conjugated BDT&#8208;based polymer PBDB&#8208;tvt is designed and synthesized. Acting as a multifunctional interlayer, it enhances light absorption, optimizes phase distribution, and charge behavior, enabling SD&#8208;hybrid devices to reach a PCE of 20.3% with good stability. This work highlights the importance of rational molecular design for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
The bicontinuous active layer morphology plays a crucial role in affecting the charge transport/recombination in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the conventional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blending typically results in an uncontrollable vertical phase distribution, hindering further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we designed a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymer donor PBDB&#8208;tvt by incorporating a long&#8208;conjugated side chain, chlorinated alkylthio&#8208;thiophene&#8208;vinyl&#8208;thiophene (tvt), onto the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit. The extended structure up&#8208;shifts energy level, enhances optical absorption, and improves charge transport. Interestingly, PBDB&#8208;tvt shows selective solubility in common processing solvents, making it suitable for sequential deposition. By using it as the interlayer between the electrode modification layer and bulk heterojunction, we constructed a hybrid device (functional modification layer/BHJ) configuration. The tailored structure not only brings improved phase distribution but also enhances light utilization in the short&#8208;wavelength region, which leads to a simultaneous increase of photovoltaic parameters, including open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor. As a result, the best device achieves a maximum PCE of 20.3%. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of a multifunctional interlayer in enhancing the light absorption and controlling the active layer morphology, providing a feasible method to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Strain Engineering and Interfacial Energy Transfer Boosting Optoelectronic Properties in C60/WS2 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, combining molecular semiconductors and atomically flat nanomaterials, offer vast opportunities to tailor optoelectronic properties at heterointerfaces. Heteroepitaxial growth of C60 on monolayer WS2 induces anisotropic compressive strain at the heterointerface due to lattice mismatch, driving the formation of 1D polymeric chains along the c&#8208;axis and activating otherwise symmetry&#8208;forbidden optical transitions. Coupled with interfacial energy transfer, photoluminescence of C60 film is enhanced by 310% over disordered aggregates, highlighting how heteroepitaxial growth, interfacial strain, and energy alignment can tailor the optoelectronic properties of vdW heterostructures. 








Abstract
Engineered van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, combining molecular semiconductors and atomically flat nanomaterials, offer vast opportunities to tailor optoelectronic properties at heterointerfaces. Here, the heteroepitaxial assembly of C60 molecules on monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML&#8208;WS2), where an anisotropic compression strain within the C60 lattice at the heterointerface induces the formation of 1D polymeric C60 strings and activates otherwise symmetry&#8208;forbidden S1 &#8594; S0 optical transitions, is reported. This, coupled with interfacial energy transfer from ML&#8208;WS2 to C60, results in a remarkable 310% enhancement in the PL intensity compared to disordered C60 aggregates. The resulting C60/ML&#8208;WS2 transistors exhibit superior electrical and optoelectronic performance, achieving a charge carrier mobility of 10.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, facilitated by an ultralow 230 meV contact barrier with Au electrodes. These devices demonstrate a superior photoresponsivity of 46.4 A W&#8722;1 and a detectivity of 3.6 &#215; 1012 Jones, greatly outperforming pristine ML&#8208;WS2 counterpart devices.

         <title>Robust Metal and Semiconductor Phase Transition Memristor Using Ag&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; intercalation in MoTe2 induces reversible 2H&#8211;1T/1T&#8242; phase transitions, as confirmed by microscopy and spectroscopy. The resulting Ag&#8314;MoTe2 PTMEM achieves a 200&#160;000 on/off ratio, enhanced retention, near&#8208;ideal linearity, and 91.7% MNIST accuracy. Compared to Li&#8314;&#8208;based PTMEMs, it offers superior stability and performance for advanced memory&#8208;based neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Metal (1T/1T')&#8208;semiconductor (2H) phase transition memristors (PTMEMs) based on intercalated alkali metal ions (Li+) in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit excellent electrical properties, including heterosynaptic plasticity. However, the low stability of Li+ ions limits retention and on/off ratios of the PTMEMs. Here, a phase transition in MoTe2 induced by intercalated Ag+ ions is demonstrated for the first time, enabling robust memristor operation. The migration of Ag+ ions, controlled by voltage biases, clearly realizes reversible 2H&#8208;1T/1T&#8217; phase transitions, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman mapping. The memristive mechanism of MoTe2 shifts from doping (4&#8211;8&#160;h) to phase transition (12&#160;h) as Ag intercalation time increases, achieving a 200&#160;000 on/off ratio at a 4&#160;nm thickness. MoTe2 exhibits the most evident phase transition due to its low transition barrier (0.84) compared to other TMDs (&gt;1.22). Intercalated Ag+ ions provide outstanding memristive performance over Li+ ions, with a 100 times higher on/off ratio, 300 times better retention, and 8 times lower non&#8208;linearity (&#946;Ag = 0.5&#8211;0.6, &#946;Li = 4.0). Ag+MoTe2 PTMEM achieves 91.7% accuracy in MNIST recognition, surpassing the 81.7% accuracy of Li+MoS2 PTMEM. These findings demonstrate that Ag+MoTe2 PTMEM holds great potential for advanced memory&#8208;based neural network applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Superwetting Nanomaterials and Beyond: Ultralow Energy Consumption in High&#8208;Efficiency Bio&#8208;Synthesis, Energy Conversion, and Information Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group. Beyond superwettability, A crucial question is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission? The physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes is revealed, and a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission in artificial systems are provided.








Abstract
This Perspective first briefly summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group over the past 25 years, starting by studying the effect of nanostructure and micro/nanostructure on surface wettability. The intrinsic wetting thresholds for different liquids according to the transition point of superlyophilicty and superlyophobicity on nanostructured surface are experimentally determined, and over 10 superwetting interfacial materials are invented. Recently, the study of dynamic superwettability is focused, which refers to the property of liquids superspreading on 1D or 2D surfaces with micro/nano structures, or partial ordered flow in micro/nano channels, and even the ordered flow of ions and molecules in biological ion channels/water channels/enzyme channels. Furthermore, a crucial question in life science is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission? It is revealed that the ordered directional collective motion of ions/molecules in biological nanochannels is the physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes, and provides a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission in artificial systems.

         <title>Integrating Hierarchical Vasculature into Engineered Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vascularization remains one of the greatest challenges in cardiac tissue engineering. Current approaches to developing myocardial and vascular structures can be broadly classified into biologically driven and engineering&#8208;driven, each offering distinct advantages and having inherent limitations. This review attempts to combine key insights from both domains to guide the integration of perfusable hierarchical vasculature into engineered cardiac tissues.








Abstract
The integration of hierarchical, perfusable vasculature remains one of the most critical and unresolved challenges in engineering human cardiac tissues. Although substantial progress has been made in independently advancing myocardial and vascular tissue constructs, integrating both into a single functional platform remains a major barrier to translation. This review categorizes and evaluates two overarching strategies for engineering vascularized cardiac tissues: biologically driven approaches that leverage cell&#8208;driven self&#8208;organization, and engineering&#8208;driven methods that impose tissue structure through biofabrication. Each strategy is examined in terms of its contributions to structural fidelity, functional maturation, and scalability, and a benchmarking framework is introduced to assess their physiological and translational relevance. Key insights are then synthesized to outline a path forward, with particular emphasis on the need for hybrid strategies that unite the complementary advantages of both approaches.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at the Full&#8208;Cell Level: A Review of Methodology Advances, Data Analytics, and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical assessment of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, covering measurement methods and data analysis across formats and chemistries and under dynamic operating conditions. It highlights methodological limitations, proposes benchmark protocols, and outlines future directions for cell&#8208;level thermal conductivity, including in situ methods, comprehensive datasets, and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted diagnosis, to enable safer and more predictable battery systems.








Abstract
The knowledge of anisotropic thermal conductivity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is paramount for accurate battery thermal modeling and diagnosis because of its decisive influence on the internal temperature distribution and overall thermal behaviors of LIBs. However, due to the complex materials, geometries, and dynamic state variations of LIBs, obtaining accurate anisotropic thermal conductivity at the full&#8208;cell level remains challenging. Here, a comprehensive review is provided on the latest methodologies and data analytics of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of battery cells with different chemistries and geometries under dynamic operating conditions. The applicability, uncertainty, advantages, and limitations of current measurement methods are examined, providing guidance for method selection and future improvement. The anisotropic thermal conductivity data across various cell formats and electrode materials are evaluated, and their variations with temperature, state of charge, state of health, and charge/discharge rates &#160;are analyzed. Additionally, future applications are highlighted for thermal conductivity to serve as a key input for thermal modeling and an indicator for battery diagnostics, with the development of in situ and real&#8208;time measurement methods and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven models. These efforts collectively support an integrated framework for next&#8208;generation thermal management systems toward improving the performance, safety, and lifespan of LIBs and other emerging batteries.

         <title>Prolonged&#8208;Nucleation Strategy via an Asymmetric Brominated Acceptor Enables &gt; 20% Efficiency in Five Different Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite efficient BTP&#8208;core acceptors, rapid nucleation limits device performance. An asymmetric acceptor, T10, is designed to regulate nucleation. Its extended core and bromination prolong nucleation time and optimize the fibrillar network. The resulting ternary device achieves a high efficiency of 19.91%, superior stability (T90 = 1609 h), and broad universality, with efficiency over 20% in five systems.








Abstract
Despite efficient charge transfer and molecular stacking in BTP&#8208;core acceptors, overly rapid nucleation often causes growth of unfavorable donor/acceptor (D/A) fibrillar networks and metastable morphologies, limiting device efficiency and stability. Herein, an asymmetric acceptor T10, featuring a brominated acenaphtho&#8208;quinoxaline central core, is developed as a nucleation&#8208;regulating ternary component. The extended 2D core promotes multi&#8208;site molecular stacking, prolonging nucleation time to 280 ms&#8212;twice that of classical eC9&#8208;4F. The strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between asymmetric T10 and PM6/eC9&#8208;4F suppress excessive D/A mixing while forming a tailored fibrillar network. Thus, the ternary device demonstrates an extended carrier lifetime (3.224 &#181;s) and a reduced defect density (1.37 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3), resulting in low energy disorder (21.82 meV). These effects enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage (0.873 V) and fill factor (80.68%), leading to a high efficiency of 19.91%. Additionally, the ternary device provides a superior photostability (T90 = 1609 h) compared with the two binary systems (127 and 726 h). More importantly, the T10&#8208;mediated prolonged nucleation has been successfully validated in five BTP&#8208;based acceptors, achieving PCEs of 20.07% (D18:eC9:T10), 20.40% (D18:BO&#8208;4Cl:T10), 20.47% (D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X:T10), 20.52% (D18:L8&#8208;BO:T10), and 20.67% (D18:eC9&#8208;4F:T10, certified 20.1%). This study demonstrates a molecularly engineered strategy with broad universality for extending nucleation kinetics in acceptor.

         <title>Tuning the Surface State and Zeta Potential of Aged CuO Nanoparticles by Additive&#8208;Free Surface Treatments as Guided by XPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging of CuO nanoparticles (NP) involves a surface reconstruction induced by hydroxylation and concurrent organic&#8208;O adsorption, which introduces O defects in the NP subsurface region. The defective surface results in a diffuse surface space region, as reflected by a low &#950;&#8208;potential of the aged NPs in ethanol solvent. Air&#8208;annealing or ozonation of the aged NPs successfully restores the pristine CuO surface state, resulting in a much higher &#950;&#8208;potential which enables the fabrication of nanoporous CuO coatings by electrophoretic deposition.








Abstract
Broad application of nanoparticles, for e.g., catalysis, antimicrobial coatings, medicine, electronics, batteries, and nanojoining technologies, is hindered by their limited shelf&#8208;life due to ambient aging. This study traces the changes in the surface chemistry of nanoparticles during atmospheric aging by monitoring the changes in the C 1s, O 1s, Cu&#160;2p core&#8208;level spectra using XPS. The atmospheric aging of nanoparticles proceeds via hydroxylation and the adsorption of organic&#8208;O surface species, which introduces defects in the subsurface region. The position and shape of the main Cu&#160;2p3/2 peak and its satellite provide a sensitive fingerprint of the nanoparticle surface state, while the O 1s spectra reveal the formation of subsurface O defect species. Air annealing at 300&#176;C and room&#8208;temperature ozonation provide additive&#8208;free, environmentally friendly surface treatments that can convert arbitrarily aged surface back to well&#8208;defined (pristine) CuO nanoparticle surface states. Thus, reproducible dispersion characteristics of CuO nanoparticles in ethanol can be obtained independently of the aging history. These findings help to extend the shelf&#8208;life of nanoparticles and enable reproducible processing routes for CuO nanopowders to be established for advancing nanotechnologies such as nanoporous oxide membranes, catalysts, functional coatings, and&#160;batteries.

         <title>Optoacoustic&#8208;Guided Magnetic Microrobot Platform for Precision Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoacoustically guided FePt@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based microrobots are designed with high drug loading capacity, controllable locomotion, and deep&#8208;tissue imaging capability. By integrating navigation, drug release, and real&#8208;time monitoring into a single platform, they provide a versatile tool for precise intervention, opening new possibilities for treating neurological disorders and tumors located in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach regions.









Abstract
Precision drug delivery remains a significant challenge due to limitations in drug loading, targeted release, precise navigation, and real&#8208;time monitoring. Here, the study reports a magnetic microrobot platform (MMP) that integrates high&#8208;capacity drug loading, magnetically actuated collective navigation, controlled drug release, and real&#8208;time 3D optoacoustic imaging in a single system. The MMP exploits synergistic advantages by embedding hard&#8208;magnetic FePt nanoparticles in a degradable ZIF&#8208;8 shell, achieving a drug loading efficiency of &#8776;93.9% and enabling precise release in response to pH changes and radiofrequency&#8208;induced heating. Reconfigurable swarm behavior strategies significantly enhance the navigation efficiency of microrobots against physiological blood flows within complex cerebral vasculature. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrate strong contrast characteristics of the microrobots, enabling high&#8208;resolution visualization of deep vascular structures and dynamic tracking of MMP with real&#8208;time 3D optoacoustic imaging. This multifunctional strategy paves the way for clinical translation and precision therapy in complex biological settings.

         <title>Operando Neutron Imaging of Lithium Flux and Gradient Cathode Design for Enhanced Kinetics in High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#9472;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando neutron imaging directly visualizes lithium flux in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, revealing sluggish Li&#8208;ion transport and nonuniform reactions as key barriers in Li&#8211;S solid&#8208;state batteries. A gradient cathode design with tailored catholyte concentrations enhances charge transfer, promotes more uniform reactions, and significantly improves sulfur utilization, offering a higher mass loading, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to their inherent safety, high energy density, and abundant sulfur resources. However, slow redox kinetics greatly limit sulfur utilization during solid&#8208;solid sulfur reactions, leading to significant challenges to achieve efficient performance in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading ASSLSBs. Here, operando neutron image is employed to directly visualize, for the first time, that sluggish Li+ transport kinetics and the uneven distribution of Li+ during cathodic reactions are critical factors limiting sulfur conversion. To address this issue, gradient cathode architectures comprising three and five layers are designed, in which catholyte concentrations are strategically varied to optimize Li&#8208;ion flux and enhance ionic conductivity of the whole composite cathode electrode. Operando neutron imaging distinctly visualizes and confirms that three&#8208;layer gradient approach significantly enhances Li&#8208;ion mobility, resulting in more uniform redox reactions and greatly improved sulfur utilization compared to traditional non&#8208;gradient structures. Consequently, the three&#8208;layer gradient cathode achieves superior rate performance and reduced electrode polarization at high sulfur mass loadings of 4.5 and 6.0 mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the applicability and scalability of this design are demonstrated in a five&#8208;layer gradient cathode architecture, achieving an impressive discharge specific capacity increase from 656 mAh g&#8722;1 (three&#8208;layer gradient) to 1232 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/20 C for ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading of 7.5 mg cm&#8722;2. This innovative gradient cathode design offers substantial advancements in understanding and overcoming Li&#8208;ion transport limitations, paving the way toward practical, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLSBs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Negative Photoconductivity Transistors via Long&#8208;Afterglow Doping for All&#8208;Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance negative photoconductivity transistor is developed with the innovation of bulk doping of D/A long&#8208;afterglow materials into polymer semiconductors. The generation of long&#8208;lived charge separation states improves the device responsiveness, thus achieving organic optoelectronic synapse simulation and high&#8208;accuracy information encryption/decryption systems.








Abstract
Negative photoconductivity (NPC)&#8208;based devices, characterised by the light&#8208;induced suppression of electrical conduction, have garnered significant interest for their multifunctional optoelectronic applications, fast light response and broadband spectral adaptability. However, conventional planar heterostructured NPC&#8208;based devices exhibit poor device performance owing to interfacial defects that disrupt carrier transport and recombination dynamics. In this study, an innovative bulk doping strategy is presented that incorporates organic long&#8208;afterglow materials into polymer semiconductors to achieve high&#8208;performance negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs). The long&#8208;afterglow dopants generate long&#8208;lived charge separation states that effectively trap gate&#8208;modulated majority carriers of polymer semiconductors, enabling persistent NPC with photosensitivity (5.29 &#215; 10&#8310;) and detectivity (3.40 &#215; 1013 Jones). In addition, this bulk doping strategy creates abundant trapping sites, which enable intralayer carrier recombination within the doped semiconductor film while maintaining an ultrahigh photosensitivity. Notably, this strategy can be generalised across diverse dopant&#8208;semiconductor systems. Furthermore, leveraging these exceptional NPTs, the negative synaptic functionalities are successfully emulated. To highlight its practical potential, system&#8208;level applicability is demonstrated by integrating NPTs into a recurrent neural network (RNN) for all&#8208;optical encryption/decryption, achieving up to 91% accuracy. This study establishes a general paradigm for high&#8208;performance NPC&#8208;based devices, unlocking their potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics and secure neuromorphic systems.

In situ, thermally driven radial spatial gradient heterophase evolution of &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs, mediated by lignin&#8208;derived carbon nanofibers, modulates the p&#8208;block Bi 6p orbitals and p&#8208;band center, enhancing sulfur redox reactions and mitigating the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides based on Sabatier principles, ultimately improving the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is hindered by challenges such as the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), slow sulfur redox reaction kinetics, and poor electrical conductivity. The electronic configuration of the p&#8208;block Bi 6p orbitals is modulated through an in situ thermally&#8208;induced reduction strategy using lignin&#8208;based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This approach enables the radial gradient heterophase transformation of &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3, leading to the formation of a high&#8208;density heterojunction network composite (&#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs) rich in oxygen vacancies (OVS), which effectively moderates the adsorption of LiPSs and enhances the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions. Based on the &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density (377&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) pouch cell with a capacity of 1.8&#160;Ah is fabricated and successfully used in drone flights, highlighting its potential for practical applications. This work elucidates the mechanism of in situ thermally&#8208;induced radial&#8208;gradient heterophase evolution of p&#8208;block metal oxides and the influence of 6p&#8208;orbital electron modulation on the sulfur redox reaction.

In this work, a bottom&#8208;up molecular design strategy is proposed to construct M&#8208;COFs with in&#8208;plane exposed metal sites, enabling the full utilization of the metal active sites toward accelerating sulfur redox in Li&#8211;S batteries.









Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring structural tunability and high porosity, have attracted great interest and are being developed into metal&#8208;COFs (M&#8208;COFs) by introducing metal atoms to boost their electrocatalytic performance. However, current M&#8208;COFs in Li&#8211;S batteries are fully metal coordinated in&#8208;plane environments, showing less exposed metal sites due to eclipsed (AA/AA') stacking modes. Here, a bottom&#8208;up molecular design strategy is proposed to construct M&#8208;COFs with in&#8208;plane exposed metal sites by precisely incorporating pyridine N atom pairs into the COF framework. Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the in&#8208;plane exposed active sites significantly reduce activation barriers for polysulfides conversion, thereby achieving excellent rate performance (1412&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;C, 842&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C) and cycle stability (0.027% capacity fade per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1&#160;C).

         <title>Universal Water Transfer Printing Enables Scalable Structural Coloration of Responsive Textile Fibers for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meter&#8208;long core&#8208;multishelled electronic fibers are judiciously fabricated via the integration of water transfer printing and coaxial extrusion, which consist of radially aligned CLC photonic sheath with highly saturated structural color, uniform liquid crystal elastomer actuation layer, and liquid metal sensing core. When woven into textiles, the strategically designed sensing gloves enable real&#8208;time visualization of stress distribution in the human hand and achieve unprecedented human&#8211;machine interaction for controlling robotic hand movements.








Abstract
Bioinspired structural coloration of&#160;responsive functional fibers&#160;is of paramount significance for smart wearable textiles and electronics. Advanced chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates, yet scalable self&#8208;assembly onto sophisticated surfaces of microscale curved fibers remains challenging. Here, water transfer printing (WTP) is pioneered as a universal strategy to judiciously transfer and radially align CLC&#8208;based structural color onto various fiber surfaces. Well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of CLCs with radially aligned helical nanostructures onto fiber surfaces are achieved by elucidating the WTP hydrodynamics of CLCs at the air&#8208;water interface. Integrating WTP with coaxial extrusion, meter&#8208;long core&#8208;multishelled electronic fibers (StructroE&#8208;fibers) are continuously fabricated, which comprise a radially aligned CLC photonic sheath, a uniform liquid crystal elastomer actuation layer, and a liquid metal sensing core. StructroE&#8208;fibers demonstrate excellent mechano&#8208;thermo&#8208;electrochromic optical outputs under external stimuli. When woven into textiles, resulting sensing gloves enable real&#8208;time stress visualization in human hand and unprecedented human&#8211;machine interaction for controlling robot hand movements. This research can offer significant insights into bioinspired structural coloration of sophisticated fibers, and large&#8208;scale fabrication of StructroE&#8208;fibers for bridging&#160;optical and electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for their practical applications in smart textiles, wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

         <title>In Situ 3D Conductive Networks and Interfacial Bonding to Stabilize Oxygen Vacancies for Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LASTP) conductive network with a fast Li+ transport channel is in situ constructed at the SCNCM interface by using the uniform liquid film strategy. This network links SCNCM particles and LASTP through of Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds. The LASTP network promotes the rapid transport of Li+, Sc&#9472;O, and Al&#9472;O bonds, stabilizes oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of the interface, slowing down the irreversible phase transition from layered structure (O3) to rock&#8208;salt (RS).








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal nickel&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (SCNCM, x &#8805; 0.9) has emerged as a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to high energy density and robust crystal structure. However, severe phase transitions contribute to performance degradation and mechanical instability during long&#8208;term cycling. To address these challenges, a uniform liquid film strategy is proposed for the in situ construction of a 3D Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LASTP) conductive network at (003) plane of SCNCM interface. This network establishes an interface bonding&#8212;via Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds&#8212;between SCNCM particles and LASTP. The LASTP framework facilitates rapid lithium&#8208;ion conduction, while the Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds stabilize oxygen vacancies, thereby suppressing oxygen evolution and enhancing interfacial structural integrity. This mitigates the irreversible phase transition (especially O3 to O1) and lattice deformation. The feasibility and effectiveness of this 3D network approach are substantiated through a combination of experimental investigations, DFT calculations, BEVL network analysis, and COMSOL simulations. As expected, the pouch&#8208;type full battery can achieve a satisfactory capacity retention of 83.7% after 1900 cycles (85.8% at 2.8&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 1200 cycles). Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 79.1% with 161.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles in 2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V at 50&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Inspired Microneedle Platform for NIR&#8208;responsive Immunomodulation and Accelerated Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research demonstrates a Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;inspired microneedle platform (MSCi@MN) that addresses chronic diabetic wounds by combining MSC&#8208;derived extracellular nanovesicles (NV)&#8211;DNA conjugates in microneedle tips with photothermal MXene in the patch layer. The NV&#8211;DNA conjugates act synergistically to regulate immune responses and promote angiogenesis, proliferation, and matrix remodeling, thereby accelerating chronic wound repair.








Abstract
Chronic diabetic wounds present substantial clinical challenges owing to sustained inflammation, compromised vascularization, and inadequate retention of therapeutic medications. Accordingly, motivated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that actively secrete bioactive exosomes in response to stimuli from the tissue microenvironment, a biomimetic microneedle (MN) platform (MSCi@MN) is created to address these challenges. The MSCi@MN exhibits a dual&#8208;compartment structure composed of MSC&#8208;derived extracellular nanovesicles (NV) conjugated with polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN; DNA), referred to as NV&#8208;DNA, encapsulated within dissolvable MN tips, and photothermal&#8208;responsive MXene nanoparticles (MX) incorporated into the base layer for targeted near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;activated drug delivery. Upon NIR irradiation, MSCi@MN quickly releases NV&#8208;DNA, effectively modifying the immune responses by facilitating anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization and activating tolerogenic dendritic cells, thereby establishing a regenerative microenvironment. Transcriptomic research has verified that NV&#8208;DNA synergistically promotes angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling by activating complementary molecular pathways. In animal models of diabetes, MSCi@MNs markedly expedite wound repair, diminish inflammation, enhance angiogenesis, and restore skin appendages without systemic adverse effects. This MSC&#8208;inspired approach, which integrates biologically sensitive controlled release with robust immunoregenerative capabilities, has substantial potential for clinical use in chronic wound treatment and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Deformability Enables Nanozyme&#8208;Integrated Vaccine for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This dynamic, multifunctional nanovaccine addresses the limitations of static, single&#8208;feature designs by combining intelligent morphology regulation with catalytic functionality. By achieving precise antigen delivery, robust DC activation, and potent CTL induction, this strategy represents a significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy leveraging vaccine&#8208;based approaches has emerged as a promising strategy for long&#8208;term tumor regression and metastasis prevention. However, the design of effective vaccines remains challenging due to the need for efficient lymph node (LN) targeting, dendritic cell (DC) uptake, and robust cellular immunity activation. Here, a proton&#8208;driven, multifunctional nanovaccine (PP@Pt&#8208;OVA) is presented that combines intelligent morphology regulation and nanozyme catalysis to address these challenges. The nanovaccine, comprising PVP@Pt nanozymes and OVA257&#8211;264 peptides encapsulated in PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PAE micelles, undergoes proton&#8208;driven morphology transformation in acidic LN microenvironments, enhancing particle size and reducing PEGylation for optimized LN retention and DC uptake. Once internalized, PVP@Pt nanozyme catalyzes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, facilitating endosomal escape, antigen cross&#8208;presentation, and DC maturation. PP@Pt&#8208;OVA demonstrated efficient LN targeting, robust CD8+ T cell activation, and significant tumor inhibition in both prophylactic and therapeutic melanoma models, with excellent biocompatibility and minimal systemic toxicity.

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic, multifunctional nanovaccine addresses the limitations of static, single-feature designs by combining intelligent morphology regulation with catalytic functionality. By achieving precise antigen delivery, robust DC activation, and potent CTL induction, this strategy represents a significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapy leveraging vaccine-based approaches has emerged as a promising strategy for long-term tumor regression and metastasis prevention. However, the design of effective vaccines remains challenging due to the need for efficient lymph node (LN) targeting, dendritic cell (DC) uptake, and robust cellular immunity activation. Here, a proton-driven, multifunctional nanovaccine (PP@Pt-OVA) is presented that combines intelligent morphology regulation and nanozyme catalysis to address these challenges. The nanovaccine, comprising PVP@Pt nanozymes and OVA&lt;sub&gt;257&#8211;264&lt;/sub&gt; peptides encapsulated in PEG-b-PAE micelles, undergoes proton-driven morphology transformation in acidic LN microenvironments, enhancing particle size and reducing PEGylation for optimized LN retention and DC uptake. Once internalized, PVP@Pt nanozyme catalyzes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, facilitating endosomal escape, antigen cross-presentation, and DC maturation. PP@Pt-OVA demonstrated efficient LN targeting, robust CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell activation, and significant tumor inhibition in both prophylactic and therapeutic melanoma models, with excellent biocompatibility and minimal systemic toxicity. These findings highlight the potential of PP@Pt-OVA as a versatile nanovaccine platform, offering a rational design framework for overcoming the limitations of subunit vaccines and advancing cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Matched C&#8211;N Coupling within Carbon Defect Confined Interlayer Fe Clusters for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, spatially matched interlayer Fe clusters (Feacs)&#160;is constructed via multiple layer defective graphite. Such as&#8208;synthesized interlayer Feacs catalyst achieves a high urea Faradaic efficiency (39.8%) and an outstanding intrinsic activity of 3643.65&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gFe&#8722;1. This work reveals that the spatial distribution of active sites is the key for C&#9472;N coupling electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Tailoring spatially matched multi&#8208;site structure to simultaneously coordinate CO2 and NO3&#8722; activation and coupling remains a significant challenge for urea electrosynthesis. Herein, interlayer Fe atomic clusters is constructed (Feacs) in expanded 2H&#8208;graphitic carbon via a carbon defect&#8208;confinement strategy, where spatially matched Feacs between graphite layers act as ideal nanoreactors for cooperative C&#9472;N coupling. These interlayer Feacs are achieved by kinetically modulating cascade reactions (FeOx reduction, H2/CO2&#8208;mediated carbon etching, and vacancy trapping) during pyrolysis under H2/Ar atmosphere with low flow rates. As a result, the interlayer Feacs catalyst exhibits a high urea Faradaic efficiency of 39.80% and a normalized production rate of 3643.65&#160;mm h&#8722;1 gFe&#8722;1, which is 7.98&#8208; and 9.88&#8208;fold higher than control samples (Fe particles without interlayer structure). In&#8208;situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the spatial matched interlayer Feacs structure promotes the adsorption of *CO intermediate and lowers energy barriers for the dehydration of NH2OH, while carbon defects favor water dissociation kinetics, accelerating subsequent hydrogenation steps and promoting C&#9472;N coupling within the interlayer Feacs. This work provides a paradigm for designing catalysts with spatial matched active sites for sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Dark Current Suppression by Engineering PIET&#8208;Active Discrete Donor&#8211;Acceptor Architecture for High&#8208;Sensitivity Semiconductor Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a discrete donor&#8211;acceptor structure and employing photoinduced electron transfer, it is demonstrated that a viologen&#8208;based, bismuth&#8208;halide photochromic semiconductor significantly reduces the dark current by &#8776;94%. This reduction far surpasses those reported for external field&#8208;induced modification methods. Correspondingly, the detection sensitivity is doubled. This synergistic strategy provides an efficient pathway to ultra&#8209;high sensitivity photodetectors and intelligent semiconductor materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitivity photodetectors are of paramount importance for astronomy, night vision, and bioimaging. Current methods for enhancing sensitivity still face the challenges of complex preparation processes and the dependence on low&#8208;temperature environments. This work demonstrates that constructing a discrete, donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) structure and employing the photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) technique may simultaneously reduce dark current and increase photocurrent efficiently, thereby significantly enhancing the detection sensitivity. With this synergetic strategy, a viologen&#8208;based photochromic semiconductor with a discrete bismuth halide structure may reduce its dark current by &#8776;94% &#8212;a reduction far exceeding those reported using external field&#8208;induced modification methods&#8212;while simultaneously enhancing the photocurrent by &#8776;83% after PIET and coloration. This value corresponds to a two&#8208;fold increase of the detection sensitivity (S). This finding opens a new effective strategy to explore ultra&#8208;highsensitivity photodetectors and smart semiconductors.

         <title>Reducing Energy Loss of 2D Perovskite Single Crystal for Stable and Efficient X&#8208;Ray Detection by Quenching the Radioluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational ion substitution strategy is designed to quench the radioluminescence (RL) intensity, reduce the interlayer spacing, and extend the RL lifetime of 2D perovskite single crystals (SCs). Therefore, the 2D SC detectors with low energy loss and then achieve a high detection sensitivity of 5217.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.5&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, excellent stability, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are demonstrated as promising materials for X&#8208;ray detection because of their large resistivity, excellent stability, tunability of interlayer spacing, and strong X&#8208;ray absorption. However, the high exciton binding energy of 2D perovskites usually generates obvious radioluminescence (RL) under X&#8208;rays, which causes non&#8208;negligible energy loss during detection. In this work, the RL intensity is successfully reduced and the carrier recombination lifetime is extended through rational design of ion (Bi3+) substitution to greatly improve the X&#8208;ray detection performance of the 2D perovskite single crystals (SCs). Specifically, the quenched RL reduces energy loss, and the extended RL lifetime improves the carrier collection efficiency during X&#8208;ray detection. In addition, 2D SCs with Bi incorporation exhibit higher ion migration activation energy and shorter interlayer spacing than the pristine SCs, thus realizing lower current drift and higher carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product. Therefore, the 2D SC detectors achieve high detection sensitivity of 5217.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, low detection limit of 2.5&#160;nGy s&#8722;1 and excellent response stability. The rare combination of these excellent properties enables the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This work provides a new design idea and a specific manipulation strategy for further improving the X&#8208;ray detection performance of 2D SCs.

         <title>Electrolyte Li+ Chemical Potential Correlates with Graphite Negative Electrode Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential (&#181;Li+) is a quantitative descriptor of electrochemical Li+ intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. Solvent cointercalation can be generally suppressed, and Li+ intercalation is enabled by employing electrolytes with t high &#181;Li+ exceeding the boundary region, which provides a design principle for advanced battery electrolytes.








Abstract
Novel electrolytes for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density and safety are being extensively explored. A major challenge in developing new electrolytes is achieving reversible Li+ intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. In commercial LIBs, this reaction is reversible in ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolytes, whereas unfavorable Li+&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs in many other electrolytes. Recently, EC&#8208;free Li+ intercalation has been achieved in some types of advanced electrolytes, including (localized) highly concentrated electrolytes and weakly coordinating electrolytes. However, an essential factor that dominates whether Li+ intercalation or Li+&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs has yet to be identified. Herein, the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential is reported as a quantitative descriptor of the Li+ intercalation behavior. Solvent cointercalation is generally inhibited above a certain threshold of the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential. This work provides a novel guideline for designing advanced LIB electrolytes.

Solvent cointercalation is generally inhibited above a certain threshold of the electrolyte Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemical potential. This work provides a novel guideline for designing advanced LIB electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Data&#8208;Driven Decoupled Multimodal Ionic Skin
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508795), Geng Yang, Kaichen Xu, and co&#8208;workers report a machine learning&#8208;enhanced modular ionic skin capable of large&#8208;range multimodal decoupled sensing. Its outstanding performance is enabled by a synergistic sensor&#8208;algorithm optimization strategy, including hard&#8208;segment modulation of ionic gels and data&#8208;driven decoupling model. Functional validation via operator hand recognition and robotic sensing feedback underscore its potential for advanced human&#8208;robot interaction.

Firefighting Applications
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508606), Sheng Wang, Liping Gong, and co&#8208;workers report a nacre&#8208;mimetic self&#8208;assembly strategy aimed at enhancing the flame and impact resistance of aramid composites. The integration of hydrogen bonding and boron&#8208;oxygen crosslinking strengthens interfacial interactions, resulting in mechanical properties that surpass those of many advanced fabrics. This approach holds significant potential for improving fabrics used in firefighting applications.

&lt;p&gt;In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202508606"&gt;DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508606&lt;/a&gt;), Sheng Wang, Liping Gong, and co-workers report a nacre-mimetic self-assembly strategy aimed at enhancing the flame and impact resistance of aramid composites. The integration of hydrogen bonding and boron-oxygen crosslinking strengthens interfacial interactions, resulting in mechanical properties that surpass those of many advanced fabrics. This approach holds significant potential for improving fabrics used in firefighting applications.

         <title>Defect Engineering toward High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to offer an in&#8208;depth comprehension of defect properties in Sn&#8208;based perovskites and to summarize the latest advancements in passivation strategies toward high&#8208;performance of Sn&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), which provides critical insight into the relationships between defect properties and FET device performance in Sn&#8208;based perovskites.








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics due to their exceptional charge transport properties, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, owing to facile Sn vacancy formation, serious oxidation as well as uncontrollable crystallization, Sn&#8208;based perovskites generally suffer from inferior film quality with high&#8208;density defects, resulting in unfavorable self&#8208;doping effects with high hole concentrations. Furthermore, defects within the relatively thin films (tens of nanometers) of these FETs, primarily located at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films, significantly impact the charge transport, ion migration, and structural stability during device operation, thereby impeding the achievement of high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs. Herein, a comprehensive overview of defect properties, origins, and their influence on the performance of Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs is present. In particular, the advanced defect passivation strategies, including compositional engineering, dopant modification, dimensional engineering, interface passivation, and crystallization regulation are summarized systematically. Lastly, the existing challenges and potential future prospects regarding defect engineering are proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite FETs, which will pave the way for further large&#8208;scale integration applications.

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208; and Perylene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based Chiral Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines recent advances in designing chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide (PDI). It categorizes structures (macrocycles, cages, aggregates, crystalline frameworks) and details chirality sources (covalent chiral modification, intrinsic PDI core distortion, exogenous induction). Key applications in circularly polarized luminescence, optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) possess significant potential for chiroptical applications due to their physical properties, including large molar extinction coefficient, high fluorescence quantum yield, reversible redox activity, and robust photochemical/thermal stability. The chirality of NDI/PDI&#8208;based supramolecular architectures primarily originates from three sources: i) covalent modification of NDI/PDI with chiral substituents, ii) intrinsic axial chirality through distortion of the PDI conjugated plane, and iii) supramolecular asymmetric assembly of achiral NDI/PDI induced by exogenous chiral environments. This review systematically outlines recent advancements in the design principles of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, including macrocycles, cages, aggregates, and crystalline frameworks, with an emphasis on the structure&#8211;activity relationship for chirality induction, transmission, and amplification. Advancements for their functional applications in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are also listed. Despite such progress, challenges persist in expanding the diversity of chiral NDI/PDI motifs, regulating the weak interactions for chiral supramolecular structures, elucidating chirality transfer and amplification mechanisms, and realizing diverse chiral applications. This review provides a comprehensive guide for the rational design of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, facilitating their full exploitation in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies, like CPL light&#8208;emitting diode and chiral biomedicine.

         <title>Responsive Polyelectrolyte Brushes in Applications: Functions, Stimuli, and Design Considerations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With advances in the synthesis of polyelectrolyte brushes, these coatings of surface&#8208;grafted chains find uses in an increasing number of applications. This review summarizes three core aspects of these brushes: how they introduce functionality to surfaces; how external stimuli influence their properties; and what practical considerations should be taken into account when designing these&#160;coatings.









Abstract
Polyelectrolyte brushes are stimulus&#8208;responsive coatings that change surface properties such as friction, adhesion, and interaction with biomolecules. Brush coatings are becoming increasingly available with improving synthesis and fabrication methods, but their use in real&#8208;world applications is trailing behind. With their stimulus&#8208;controlled properties, brushes can fulfill a variety of functions when they are applied in a broad spectrum of use cases ranging from tunable lubrication to ionic current rectification. In this review, summarizes the functional roles polyelectrolyte brushes can play in applications by affecting the mechanical, molecular, and electrical properties of surfaces; the main stimuli that are used to exploit the responsiveness of these coatings are discussed; and design considerations to choose an initial brush when designing systems for new applications are provided. This review concludes with a short outlook on the outstanding challenges and opportunities for applying stimulus&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte&#160;brushes.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer a powerful approach for cancer immunotherapy, but their clinical impact remains limited by delivery challenges and suboptimal immune activation. This review discusses key biological barriers and design strategies&#8212;including structural optimization, immunomodulation, organ targeting delivery, and advanced nanocarriers&#8212;to enhance vaccine efficacy. Emerging innovations and translational challenges are highlighted to guide next&#8208;generation mRNA cancer vaccine development.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy, enabling the induction of precise and robust immune responses against tumor antigens. Nevertheless, enormous challenges remain, in particular its limitations in achieving optimal immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy, result in modest clinical benefit. Here, the biological barriers are reviewed that impede the functionality of mRNA cancer vaccine and describe the design considerations, including structure engineering, chemical modification, and development of next&#8208;generation delivery materials for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Recent advances are highlighted aimed at improving vaccine efficacy through targeted delivery, modulation of immune cell interactions, and stimulation of innate immune responses. Finally, the challenges are examined in clinical translation and explore future directions for improving the therapeutic potential of mRNA cancer vaccines. By synthesizing current progress and identifying critical hurdles, this review provides a framework for advancing mRNA&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts: Hidden Gems for Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, covering catalyst design, performance optimization, and comparison to noble and transition metals, outlining reaction mechanisms by a synthesis of DFT calculations reported in the literature. Considering the merits and limitations of different metals, it outlines key challenges, actionable strategies, and future prospects for the field.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a sustainable alternative for the traditional anthraquinone method. p&#8208;block metals exhibit unique electronic structures and tunable surface properties, showing great potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. However, a systematic review focusing on recent progress in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis is lacking. To fill the gap, this work first shows a marked increase in p&#8208;block metal research over the past decade by bibliometric analysis of over 300 publications. Research on 2e&#8722; ORR has surged since 2019, while research on 2e&#8210; water oxidation reaction (WOR) has declined. Strategies for the synthesis and optimization of various p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Based on a synthesis of DFT calculations in the literature, the reaction mechanisms of p&#8208;block metal catalysis proceeding are summarized via a 2e&#8722; pathway. Finally, considering the merits and limitations of different metals, this review outlines the primary challenges and future directions in this area, emphasizing the importance of improving catalyst stability, deepening mechanistic understanding, and developing cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods. It also offers novel perspectives on the engineering of p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts and promotes the development of sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Oxygen Spillover: Revolutionizing Catalytic Performance and Disrupting Mechanistic Paradigms in Sustainable Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illuminates oxygen spillover as a transformative interfacial phenomenon that decouples adsorption/desorption energetics and reconfigures reaction pathways. It systematically details mechanistic principles, characterization advances, and rational catalyst design strategies across energy&#8208;critical reactions. By overcoming scaling relationships and stability limitations, oxygen spillover provides a universal framework for optimizing efficiency, selectivity, and durability in sustainable catalysis.








Abstract
Oxygen spillover, a dynamic interfacial phenomenon in catalysis, enables the migration of active oxygen species (*O, *OH) across catalyst interfaces, overcoming the limitations of traditional static active sites and establishing a new paradigm for optimizing catalytic performance in sustainable chemistry. This review systematically examines mechanistic advances in oxygen spillover and its applications in energy&#8208;related catalytic reactions (e.g., oxygen evolution reactions, oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions, hydrogen oxidation reactions, organics oxidation reactions), highlighting its core advantage in decoupling intermediate adsorption/desorption energetics and reconstructing reaction kinetic pathways. By integrating in situ characterization and theoretical simulations, the regulatory mechanisms of electronic structure gradients, defect engineering, and heterojunction design on spillover kinetics are elucidated, along with rational design strategies for atomically precise catalysts. The oxygen spillover mechanism not only addresses the trilemma of catalytic efficiency&#8208;selectivity&#8208;stability but also provides unified design principles for cross&#8208;disciplinary catalytic systems, driving the paradigm shift in catalysis science from phenomenological description to predictive design.

         <title>Low&#8208;Energy, Ultrafast Spin Reorientation at Competing Hybrid Interfaces with Tunable Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin reorientation transition is generated at hybrid interfaces of Pt&#8208;Co&#8208;organic molecules in the vicinity of room temperature. This spin reorientation transition happens at an ultrafast scale and is controlled either through electrical current or fs laser pulse, introducing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in formerly planar magnetised samples through heating.








Abstract
Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to rewrite&#160;the information by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo&#8208;molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, a spin reorientation transition is demonstrated in molecular interfaces of 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in&#8208;plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 &#8211; 1.9&#160;nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen, and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 105&#8197;A&#8197;cm&#8722;2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12&#8197;mJ&#8197;cm&#8722;2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.

Here, a spin reorientation transition is demonstrated in molecular interfaces of 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in-plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 &#8211; 1.9&#160;nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, hydrogen, and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&#8197;&lt;b&gt;cm&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12&#8197;&lt;b&gt;mJ&lt;/b&gt;&#8197;&lt;b&gt;cm&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering a Lipid Nanoparticle with Atypical Calcium Crystal Structure for Enhanced IFN&#946;&#8208;Mediated Immunotherapy</title>

The engineered lipid nanoparticles (NanoCa) demonstrate potent anti&#8208;tumor effects by activating type I interferons, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, and enhancing antigen presentation.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy; however, many patients exhibit suboptimal responses, which is due to inadequate T cell priming by the innate immune response. Metal ions play a critical role in modulating the innate immune response. However, the mechanisms by which metal ions facilitate dendritic cell maturation through the activation of interferon remain poorly understood. This research identifies a nanomaterial Calcium phosphate&#8208;containing liposome (NanoCa), characterized by an atypical crystal structure and pH&#8208;responsive profile. NanoCa promotes bone marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cell maturation and exhibits antiviral effects and anti&#8208;tumor properties in different tumor models. Also, NanoCa acts as an immunostimulant by fostering antibody production. Furthermore, when combined with programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD&#8208;1)&#160; blocking antibodies, NanoCa synergistically enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy in CT26 models. Mechanistically, NanoCa rapidly releases Ca2+ via the lysosome pathway post&#8208;endocytosis, subsequently triggering interferon through the Ca2+&#8208;calcineurin (CaN) &#8208; nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc2) &#8208; protein kinase C beta (PKC&#946;) &#8208; interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signal pathway. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) shows NanoCa increases the population of tumoral infiltrating dendritic cell (DC), C1qc+ TAM, and CD8T_eff cells and decreases the CD8T_ex and immunosuppressive SPP1+ TAM population in tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes. Overall, NanoCa shows translational potential for anti&#8208;tumor immune therapeutics.

         <title>Decoupling the Exciton&#8208;Carrier Interaction for Highly Efficient Pure Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exceeding 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel De&#8208;EML, which can decouple the interaction between excitons and charge carriers and anchor the recombination zone to the center of the EML, is fabricated, perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on the De&#8208;EML exhibit the pure blue emission at 469nm and record an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.3%, a record lifetime of 184.7 h.








Abstract
Pure blue emission (wavelength &#8804; 470&#160;nm) is essential for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) in the application of future displays. However, the performance of the pure blue PeLEDs is far away from the application requirement and theoretical values. The charging of excitons plays a crucial role in the non&#8208;radiative decay of the high&#8208;energy blue perovskite emitters under electric fields. Here, a designed exciton&#8208;carrier decoupling emitting layer (De&#8208;EML) is reported which can simultaneously suppress the formation of charged excitons and facilitate the injection of carriers. By tuning the energy levels of each QD layer in the De&#8208;EML, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reached 83.7%, and the Auger recombination related to exciton&#8208;carrier coupling in high excitation intensities is suppressed. Based on the designed De&#8208;EML, high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs (emission at 469&#160;nm) with an EQE of 20.3% and an operational lifetime (T80) of 4.8 h at 1070&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is demonstrated. A record maximum brightness of 31&#8201;407&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is also achieved.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Ion&#8208;Exchange Enabled Active Swarming System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;regulated swarm intelligence system is developed through the integration of ionic communication and photochemical regulation, successfully replicating predator&#8208;prey ecological dynamics. This platform demonstrates spatiotemporally programmable collective behaviors through light modulation, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. This intelligent swarm design paradigm opens new avenues for smart collective robotics and applications in environmental remediation and beyond.








Abstract
Swarming behavior often enables systems to achieve intelligent responses that surpass the capabilities of individual components, allowing for complex tasks to be accomplished. Despite significant advances in active swarm research, achieving precise control over swarm responsiveness remains a challenge. In this study, a light&#8208;controlled chemical communication&#8208;mediated swarming system through integrating the ion&#8208;exchange and light decomposition reactions to emulate predator&#8208;prey interactions is designed. In this system, ion exchange resin particles (acting as &#8220;predators&#8221;) actively approach and aggregate silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) nanoparticles (acting as &#8220;prey&#8221;), which in turn exhibit light&#8208;triggered escape responses driven by photodecomposition&#8208;induced ionic gradients. These swarms exhibit a range of novel, light&#8208;modulated dynamic behaviors, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. These behaviors provide valuable insights into active swarm dynamics. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of the collective swarming, active interactions, and light&#8208;induced Ag&#8314; production establish a robust antibacterial platform capable of rapid and efficient bacterial eradication. This intelligent swarm design presents new possibilities for the development of multifunctional, responsive swarms, offering valuable applications in environmental treatment and beyond.

         <title>Environmental Control of Ferroelectricity in Hafnia Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible transition from nonferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior is achieved in hafnia films by modulating the surrounding atmosphere. The domain relaxation dynamics exhibit high sensitivity to environmental factors, including gas composition (ambient, N2, CO2, O2) and relative humidity, highlighting the crucial role of the measurement environment in determining the ferroelectric properties of hafnia films.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity in hafnia films has triggered significant research interest over the past decade due to its immense promise for next&#8208;generation memory devices. However, the origin of ferroic behavior at the nanoscale and the means to control it remain an open question, with the consensus being that it deviates from conventional ferroelectrics. In this work, a novel approach is presented to tune ferroelectric properties of hafnia through environmental control using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A reversible transition from non&#8208;ferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior by modulating the surrounding atmosphere is demonstrated. Notably, the domain relaxation dynamics exhibit striking sensitivity to environmental factors, including ambient conditions, specific gas compositions (N2, CO2, O2), and humidity levels. The critical role of surface water removal, gas molecule adsorption, and their interactions with near&#8208;surface oxygen vacancies is identified and the injected charge in determining ferroelectricity in uncapped hafnia films. These insights reveal a significant strategy for stabilizing ferroic responses by carefully regulating the chemical environment, offering new possibilities for precise control in hafnia&#8208;based films.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Grayscale Digital Light Processing for Mechanically Robust 3D&#8208;Printed Gradient Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>

A machine learning&#8208;driven grayscale digital light processing (g&#8208;DLP) platform integrates optimization of gradient structures and photocurable resin materials with extensive tunability. The optimized gradient structure, fabricated from developed polyurethane acrylates with enhanced damping and customizable stiffness, reduces stress concentration, confirming the mechanical robustness of the g&#8208;DLP platform. This technology offers versatile solutions for applications, ranging from biomedical to automotive.








Abstract
Grayscale digital light processing (g&#8208;DLP) is gaining recognition for its capability to create material property gradients within a single resin system, enabling programmable mechanical responses, enhanced shape accuracy, and improved toughness. However, research on the mechanical robustness of g&#8208;DLP is constrained by the limited range of tailorable properties in photocurable resins and insufficient exploration of structural optimization for complex geometries. This study presents a synergistic g&#8208;DLP strategy that integrates the synthesis of dynamic bond&#8208;controlled polyurethane acrylate (PUA) with a machine learning&#8208;based multi&#8208;objective optimization, enabling mechanically robust 3D&#8208;printed gradient materials. A PUA&#8208;based resin system is developed that expands the achievable elastic modulus from 8.3&#160;MPa to 1.2&#160;GPa, while maintaining superior damping performance, making it suitable for diverse applications. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization framework is constructed to efficiently identify optimal gradient structures, reducing strain concentrations and controlling effective stiffness. This approach is applicable to various 3D and arbitrary geometries, achieving a significant strain concentration reduction of up to 83% and demonstrating delayed crack initiation. By combining the developed material with this optimization framework, a versatile platform is established for creating mechanically robust g&#8208;DLP printed components, applicable in areas ranging from biomimetic artificial cartilage to automotive energy&#8208;absorbing structures.

         <title>Two&#8208;Stage Bipolaron Formation in Molecularly Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates bipolaron formation in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ)&#8208;doped conjugated polymer P(g32T&#8208;T) films with glycol sidechains at two stages of both low and high doping levels. At the early stage, bipolarons mainly form from double doping, enhancing structural ordering, and carrier transport. In contrast, late&#8208;stage bipolarons, mostly generated by polaron combination, exhibit adverse effects on those properties.








Abstract
The formation and dynamics of bipolarons are crucial in determining the electrical properties of molecularly doped conjugated polymers. Traditionally, bipolarons are known to form at very high doping levels through the combination of two adjacent polarons, a process that is generally accompanied by structural disorder and impaired carrier transport. Here, it is demonstrated that bipolaron formation can occur at both the early stage with low doping levels and the late stage with high doping levels in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) dip&#8208;doped conjugated polymer films with glycol sidechains. Bipolaron formation at the early stage is discovered to be mainly associated with double doping, which is uncommon in conventional doped polymer systems. In contrast, bipolaron formation at the late stage is dominated by combining two polarons. Furthermore, these bipolarons are observed to behave differently: early&#8208;stage bipolarons generated through double doping enhance both the molecular ordering and carrier transport, whereas late&#8208;stage bipolarons resulting from polaron combination occur alongside detrimental effects in structural and transport properties. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of bipolaron formation across different doping levels and underscore the potential for optimizing doping strategies. A deeper understanding of bipolarons can guide the design of next&#8208;generation molecularly doped conjugated polymers with improved performance.

         <title>Solar Trap&#8208;Adsorption Photocathode for Highly Stable 2.4&#160;V Dual&#8208;Ion Solid&#8208;State Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic||I2 battery system with a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism is developed. This design offers accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhanced utilization of iodine ions, avoided polyiodide's shuttle, and four&#8208;electron reaction mechanism for iodine species conversion. Leveraging the above merits, the photo&#8208;assisted PTCDI||I2 battery delivers a high energy density of 0.66&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2 alongside remarkable long&#8208;term cycling durability and excellent bending capability.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous iodine&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage systems offer a cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional alkali metal batteries for grid&#8208;scale applications. However, their practical deployment is hindered by sluggish iodine redox kinetics and the shuttle of polyiodides, which severely limit their lifespan. To address these challenges, a novel solid&#8208;state organic||I2 battery leveraging a Co3O4&#8208;TiO2 heterojunction photocathode is developed. By integrating a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism with an innovative device architecture, the system achieves accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhances iodide ion utilization, and enables a four&#8208;electron redox pathway. Theoretical calculation combined with electrochemical analysis reveals that the photo&#8208;assisted mechanism promotes electrostatic adsorption of polyiodides, accelerates interfacial charge transfer, and significantly improves iodine redox kinetics. As a result, the organic||I2 battery delivers a high specific capacity of 1.36&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a discharge voltage of 2.4&#160;V, and excellent cycle stability over 1000 cycles, retaining 80.9% of its capacity at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This photo&#8208;enhanced battery exhibits strong competitiveness compared to previously reported iodine&#8208;based batteries. The remarkable performance of this photo&#8208;assisted prototype offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solution for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Spin Frustration and Unconventional Surface Spin Canting State in Van der Waals Ferromagnet/Antiferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigate Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 heterostructures by characterizing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spins separately. Three equivalent in&#8208;plane AFM domains are identified in NiPS3. We provide evidence of an interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and surface spin canting, with Fe5GeTe2 spins gradually rotating from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane near the interface to in&#8208;plane. Such interfacial spin canting is a unique property of van der Waals magnetic materials.








Abstract
Atomically flat surfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials pave an avenue for addressing a long&#8208;standing fundamental issue of how a compensated antiferromagnet (AFM) surface frustrates a ferromagnetic (FM) overlayer in FM/AFM heterostructures. We investigate Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 vdW heterostructures by characterizing AFM and FM spins separately. We find that in&#8208;plane zig&#8208;zag AFM NiPS3 develops three equivalent AFM domains, which are robust against external magnetic field and magnetic coupling with Fe5GeTe2. Moreover, evidence is provided of in&#8208;plane&#8208;AFM&#8208;induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in adjacent Fe5GeTe2, and an unconventional out&#8208;of&#8208;plane surface spin canting state with the Fe5GeTe2 spins spatially turn from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction near the interface to in&#8208;plane direction away from the interface in Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane surface spin canting is a unique property of spin frustration in vdW magnetic heterostructures.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein Mimicking Nanodiscs with Pt(IV) Prodrug Enable Tumor Targeting and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway Activation for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

A synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), activating the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites.








Abstract
Cisplatin is a first&#8208;line, broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;tumor drug used to treat various types of cancer. However, immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) are often induced by cisplatin. Here, a first synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), inducing a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in dsDNA release compared to cisplatin. This further activates the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites. The sHDL@Pt can induce severe DNA damage, which subsequently results in a more pronounced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. This work introduces a novel approach for delivering Pt(IV) prodrug that effectively initiates and activates innate immunity through the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Highly Linear Bipolar Photoresponse in Se@SWCNT Adaptive Neurons for Dynamically Programmable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamically programmable synaptic transistor with a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling both positive and negative responses via gate&#8208;tunable modulation. The transistor achieves high symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation, demonstrating excellent performance across complex tasks, offering promising applications in brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems with high accuracy.








Abstract
The development of tunable and highly controllable photoconductive devices for brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems remains challenging. Previous neuromorphic devices are limited by asymmetric and nonlinear conductive properties, which impose specific restrictions on training tasks and weight learning rules in dynamic and complex visual environments. A programmable synaptic transistor based on a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling gate&#8208;controlled positive and negative responses is presented. This approach eliminates the need for multilayer heterojunctions or complex circuits, simplifying array integration and wafer&#8208;scale fabrication. This phototransistor shows improved symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation following optical stimulation, and simultaneously achieves linear persistent photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity with over 128 memory states, which is not reported previously. By adjusting light intensity and wavelength range, consistent weight rule processing across three tasks of increasing complexity is demonstrated. Notably, different visual tasks require distinct neural structures and decay rates. The proposed transistor facilitates transitions between bio&#8208;inspired brain regions via optical hybrid programming, adapting to dynamic visual environments. This innovation contributes significantly to brain&#8208;like computing and bio&#8208;inspired vision, due to its exceptional accuracy and dynamic switch models.

         <title>Spatial Crystallization Homogenization Boosts Scalable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative and facile strategy is proposed to delay rapid nucleation and mitigate spatial crystallization heterogeneity, which enables the applicability to efficient and large&#8208;area device fabrication. The fabricated small&#8208;area (0.1 cm2) green PeLED delivers an impressive EQE of 30.98% at 515&#160;nm. At the same time, a remarkable EQE of 23.21% is also achieved when the active area expands to 6.25 cm2.








Abstract
Conventional antisolvent dripping methods face fundamental limitations in controlling crystallization kinetics, particularly manifesting as instantaneous nucleation and severe spatial inhomogeneity in scaled&#8208;up perovskite films. Herein, a microdroplet&#8208;phase antisolvent deposition technique is developed that establishes a controlled crystallization environment through delayed nucleation kinetics via mild antisolvent interaction and uniform microdroplet diffusion across extended substrates. The resulting small&#8208;area (0.1 cm2) device attains an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.98% at 515&#160;nm, ranking among the best&#8208;performing green perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). A remarkable EQE of 23.21% is also realized when the active area expands to 6.25 cm2. This work provides a fundamental advancement in perovskite crystallization control and demonstrates a viable pathway toward industrial&#8208;scale production of PeLEDs.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermo Cooperative Responsiveness of Cholesteric Heliconical Photonics Architectures Featuring Adaptative Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents electro&#8208;thermal cooperative cholesteric heliconical photonic architectures that achieve unprecedented control over thermochromic behavior, enabling linear and programmable temperature sensitivity, full&#8208;visible range structural color modulation, and customizable operating ranges. By harnessing these advanced capabilities into intelligent sensing and high&#8208;dimensional information encryption, this study paves the way for multi&#8208;functional soft matter systems and next&#8208;generation photonic technologies.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive structural color materials hold immense promise for environmental monitoring, adaptive camouflage, and advanced photonic technologies. However, conventional systems suffer from fixed temperature sensitivity, nonlinear responses, and limited tunability due to intrinsic physicochemical properties. Herein, cholesteric heliconical architectures are established to achieve unprecedented control over thermochromic behaviors. The system demonstrates impressive temperature sensitivity with near&#8208;linear correlation, characterized by a reflection wavelength shift of 5&#160;nm per 0.05&#160;&#176;C across the entire visible spectrum. Remarkably, the sensitivity can be dynamically programmed from 100 to 50&#160;nm&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 via electric field modulation, offering unparalleled flexibility in designing application&#8208;specific responsive profiles. The electro&#8208;thermal synergy originates from the interplay between temperature&#8208;dependent bend elastic effect and field&#8208;induced dielectric torque within LC dimer&#8208;based material systems, which collectively regulate heliconical pitch and cone angle. By integrating digital photolithography, spatially heliconical microdomains with distinct thermal responsive behaviors, enabling cutting&#8208;edge multiplexed temperature visualization and dynamic information encryption are further fabricated. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for multifunctional photonic materials, opening new avenues for soft matter photonics, adaptive optics, and next&#8208;generation photonic devices.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand ER Stress Modulation in Tumor Cells and TAMs via an Adaptively Transformable Nanoplatform Enhances Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptively transformable nanoplatform prolongs circulation and transforms into the core and shell parts at the tumor site, which enable targeted delivery of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#160;stress inhibitor to tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and a photosensitizer to tumor cells respectively. This allows for on&#8208;demand regulation of ER stress in both cell types, thus establishing a cooperative anti&#8208;tumor immune network and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor activity.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) primarily through activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in tumor cells. However, ER stress is shown to promote the activation and proliferation of the immunosuppressive tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which are pivotal drivers of immune evasion. Coordinating the conflicting demands of ER stress signaling pathways in tumor cells and TAMs is crucial for potentiating PDT&#8208;based immune therapy. Here, an adaptively transformable nanoplatform (G@MDHP) is developed to facilitate the respective delivery of a photosensitizer and an ER stress inhibitor into tumor cells and TAMs efficiently. G@MDHP, which mimics the surface change of erythrocytes throughout their life span to cater for the rejection or phagocytosis by macrophages, exhibits prolonged circulation due to its surface CD47 peptide, while undergoing shell exfoliation in the presence of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9) to expose mannose&#8208;functionalized core nanoparticles (G@MD). The disassociated G@MD, carrying the inhibitor, specifically inhibits ER stress in immunosuppressive TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. Meanwhile, the disassociated shell containing a photosensitizer is rapidly internalized by tumor cells to exert PDT&#8208;induced ER stress amplification and provoke a robust ICD. This dual action of core and shell components thus establish a cooperative anti&#8208;tumor immune network, bringing about significant therapeutic benefits.

&lt;p&gt;An adaptively transformable nanoplatform prolongs circulation and transforms into the core and shell parts at the tumor site, which enable targeted delivery of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#160;stress inhibitor to tumor-associated macrophages and a photosensitizer to tumor cells respectively. This allows for on-demand regulation of ER stress in both cell types, thus establishing a cooperative anti-tumor immune network and enhancing anti-tumor activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) primarily through activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in tumor cells. However, ER stress is shown to promote the activation and proliferation of the immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are pivotal drivers of immune evasion. Coordinating the conflicting demands of ER stress signaling pathways in tumor cells and TAMs is crucial for potentiating PDT-based immune therapy. Here, an adaptively transformable nanoplatform (G@MDHP) is developed to facilitate the respective delivery of a photosensitizer and an ER stress inhibitor into tumor cells and TAMs efficiently. G@MDHP, which mimics the surface change of erythrocytes throughout their life span to cater for the rejection or phagocytosis by macrophages, exhibits prolonged circulation due to its surface CD47 peptide, while undergoing shell exfoliation in the presence of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to expose mannose-functionalized core nanoparticles (G@MD). The disassociated G@MD, carrying the inhibitor, specifically inhibits ER stress in immunosuppressive TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. Meanwhile, the disassociated shell containing a photosensitizer is rapidly internalized by tumor cells to exert PDT-induced ER stress amplification and provoke a robust ICD. This dual action of core and shell components thus establish a cooperative anti-tumor immune network, bringing about significant therapeutic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Co&#8208;Free Medium&#8208;Ni Layered Oxide Cathodes via Additional Li Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based layered cathodes are crucial for constructing next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. This work proposes a promising design strategy of introducing Li richness in LiNiO2 by incorporation of Li2MnO3, exhibting suppressed Li/Ni disordering and evoking proper amount of reversible O redox that stabilizes the structure under high voltage.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity cathode materials are requisite for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries. Although efforts are being concentrated on exploring ultra&#8208;Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides, the structural instability of these cathodes remains a hard nut to crack before reaching their practicality. Alternatively, raising the upper cutoff voltage of medium&#8208;Ni oxides can equivalently increase the capacity, but it also devastates the structure. Here, a strategy is proposed to circumvent this dilemma by enriching the Li ions in medium&#8208;Ni layered oxides, and meanwhile remaining Co&#8208;free. Through surveying a range of compositions of Li1+yNi1&#8722;3yMn2yO2 (0.03&#8804; y&#8804;0.15), a threshold for Li richness in this class of compounds is pinpointed, as represented by Li1.12Ni0.64Mn0.24O2, which is crucial to reach optimum capacity and cycling. This is delicately mediated by the proper amount of reversible anionic redox, as evidenced by electrochemistry and spectroscopy, that contributes to the structural stability even cycled to 4.5&#160;V. We also found that the existence of additional Li ions in the lattice can effectively suppress the Li/Ni mixing, thereby weakening the necessity of Co in Ni&#8208;based cathodes. As a result, Li1.12Ni0.64Mn0.24O2 shows a capacity of &#8776;200&#160;mA h&#160;g&#8722;1 that can be sustained for 100 cycles, which is further validated by an excellent long&#8208;life full&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Covalent Tridentate Molecule Anchoring Enhances Nickel Oxide for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiOx suffers from high surface defects and an energy level mismatch with perovskite. Conventional organic modifiers, limited by weak binding, fail to deliver effective surface passivation and energy level regulation. We design [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), forming strong tridentate bonds with NiOx to reduce surface defects, while its terminal dipole group optimizes energy alignment, enabling efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material for perovskite solar cells, but its high surface defect density and energy level mismatch with perovskite limit&#160;device efficiency. Conventional organic surface modifiers, relying on weak hydrogen bonds or single covalent bonds, fail to anchor stably to NiOx, hindering their functional effectiveness. Here, A multidentate anchoring organic molecule, [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), is presented, forming robust tridentate covalent bonds with the NiOx surface and significantly enhances interfacial binding strength and surface coverage compared with conventional groups (e.g., carboxyl). As a result, the interfacial defect density is reduced by 2.5&#8208;fold compared with carboxyl&#8208;modified counterparts and significantly suppresses the deprotonation reaction between NiOx and perovskite, thereby greatly improving interfacial contact. The designed trifluoromethyl terminal group further enables precise tuning of NiOx energy levels, achieving near&#8208;ideal band alignment with perovskite (energy offset &#916;E = 0.01&#160;eV). Incorporating this modified NiOx into inverted devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% is achieved, along with outstanding operational stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1500 h&#160;of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking (65&#160;&#176;C, 60% relative humidity, AM 1.5G illumination, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 protocol).

         <dc:description>
Adsorption isotherms serve as descriptors which is accessible via both experiments and simulations. A training set optimization strategy based on descriptor similarity significantly reduces the training costs of AI model. The combination of AI, simulation and experiment accelerates the discovery of the high&#8208;performance MOF for separating n/i&#8208;butane.








Abstract
There are significant challenges in developing efficient adsorbents as alternatives to the energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes for n/i&#8208;butane separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential in addressing this issue. However, the vast diversity of MOFs makes the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Here, the high&#8208;throughput screening based on artificial intelligence (AI)&#160;is employed to accelerate the identification of MOFs for n/i&#8208;butane separation. An integrated descriptor system, accessible via both experiments and simulations, is proposed and broadly validated, demonstrating better performance over those widely&#8208;used descriptors. In addition, an optimization strategy for training dataset is proposed based on similarity, allowing for the efficient model training with only 10% samples from the entire database and thus significantly reducing the costs. Leveraging the integrated descriptors and optimization strategy, MOFs with exceptional n/i&#8208;butane separation performance are successfully identified through neural network model. As a proof of concept, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn is synthesized for validation because it has the largest n&#8208;butane capacity among top 20 MOFs. The SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn demonstrates outstanding n/i&#8208;butane separation performance with nearly zero uptake of i&#8208;butane. This work introduces a novel research paradigm integrating AI, simulation and experiment, and presents an efficient process with broad applicability for material discovery.

Wool fibers, commonly used in autumn&#8208;winter clothing, are prone to generating static electricity, leading to discomfort and safety concerns for wearers, thus posing a long&#8208;standing challenge for the textile industry in developing simple and effective anti&#8208;static solutions. Herein, a core&#8208;sheath yarn (CSY) is introduced, produced at a large scale (&#8776;6 m&#160;min&#8722;1) through wrap spinning to transform wool's static nuisance into triboelectric energy. The CSY knitted fabric (CSYF) can simultaneously achieve excellent static elimination half&#8208;life (&#8776;0.21 s) and efficient energy conversion (&#8776;430&#160;V, &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;A at 2&#160;Hz). With good dyeability, considerably high flexibility (&#8776;200% stretchability), and exceptional output power (&#8776;740&#160;mW m&#8722;2), surpassing most yarn&#8208;based triboelectric textiles, CSYF demonstrates applications in power sources and self&#8208;powered sensing. This work offers a dual&#8208;benefit proposal for the green and sustainable conversion and utilization of challenging energy sources.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Direct Photocatalytic Patterning for Efficient Perovskite Nanocrystal LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;strategy is presented direct photocatalytic patterning that enables high&#8208;resolution, nondestructive patterning and fabrication of efficient crosslinked perovskite nanocrystal&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeNC&#8208;LEDs). The first strategy systematically identifies thiol crosslinkers for advanced direct photocatalytic patterning. The second applies film&#8208;state ligand exchange to enhance optical and electrical properties. Dual strategy demonstrates CsPbBr3 PeNC&#8208;LEDs with 14.7% external quantum efficiency and &#8776;25,400&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 luminance after patterning process.








Abstract
Achieving nondestructive, high&#8208;resolution patterning of perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs)&#160;is essential for next&#8208;generation near&#8208;eye displays. However, the intrinsic instability of PeNCs renders conventional patterning methods detrimental to their optical and electrical properties. Herein, a dual strategy is reported that enables both high&#8208;resolution patterning and the fabrication of efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). The first strategy involves an advanced direct photocatalytic patterning method. Thiol crosslinkers are systematically investigated and identified 1,8&#8208;octanedithiol and 1,10&#8208;decanedithiol as optimal candidates due to their solvent compatibility, colloidal stability, and ability to achieve nondestructive patterning with high resolution and fidelity. The second strategy introduces a film&#8208;state ligand exchange (FLE) process to enhance the optical and electrical properties of patterned PeNC films. Replacing long&#8208;chain ligands with short&#8208;chain ammonium halides results in denser surface passivation and enhanced charge transport capability. Dual strategy enabled high&#8208;performance crosslinked PeNC&#8208;LEDs, including a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.7% and luminance of &#8776;25,400&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 for green CsPbBr3 LEDs, representing the highest values reported for green CsPbBr3 PeNC&#8208;LEDs obtained via direct optical patterning. Furthermore, FLE enabled post&#8208;patterning halide exchange, representing the first demonstration of a red crosslinked CsPbBrxI3&#8722;x PeNC&#8208;LED via direct optical patterning. This study establishes molecular and lithographic design principles for integrating colloidal nanocrystals into next&#8208;generation displays and optoelectronics.

         <title>Unlocking Fast Lithium Ion Migration in Zirconium&#8208;Based Fluoride Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates ionic conduction mechanisms of fluoride solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) (Li2+xZr1&#8208;xYxF6) and proposes carrier&#8208;vacancy compensation, unit cell distortion mitigation, and defect engineering. By employing a lithium&#8208;rich strategy to regulate 0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, and 2D defects, a significant enhancement in ionic conductivity is achieved. The optimized zirconium&#8208;based fluoride electrolyte enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) to achieve a capacity retention of 66.83% after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Fluoride solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted significant interest due to the extremely high oxidation limits, excellent air stability, and favorable compatibility with metallic lithium, while the structure&#8208;property relationship remains unknown. Although crystalline Li2ZrF6 (LZF) synthesized at high temperatures exhibits extremely low ionic conductivity, the ionic conductivity of its quasicrystalline counterpart synthesized via lithium&#8208;rich strategies can be enhanced by at least an order of magnitude. The enhanced ionic conductivity is attributed to effective modulation of 0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, and 2D defects in the structure, which manifests as an optimized carrier&#8208;vacancy concentration equilibrium, structural rearrangement of framework units, and adjustment of dislocation and grain boundary configurations. Driven by these mechanisms, the sample with x = 0.5 exhibits the highest ionic conductivity and lowest activation energy. To elucidate this trend, combining simple theoretical models and experiments demonstrates the guiding role of the carrier&#8208;vacancy theory, unit cell distortion theory, and defect theory in advancing ion transport of fluoride SSEs. In addition, the zirconium&#8208;based fluoride exhibits superior oxidation stability and excellent compatibility with lithium metal, enabling the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) fabricated with it as a cathode additive to achieve a capacity retention rate of 66.83% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Capacitance&#8208;Enhanced Battery: Integrating High&#8208;Density Battery Capacity with Supercapacitive Swiftness in an Ultra&#8208;Large MXene Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional C@BiZnS@V4C3 material exhibits both battery&#8208;like and supercapacitive behaviors, providing robust energy retention at lower current densities and swift ion adsorption at higher current densities. This unique combination delivers a good specific capacity and exceptional durability over 10&#160;000 cycles. The findings highlight the potential of ultra&#8208;large MXene&#8208;based composites as pioneering materials for advanced energy storage systems.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of electrochemical energy storage based on earth&#8208;abundant sodium (Na) ions necessitates the seamless integration of high energy density and fast charge&#8211;discharge kinetics. A persistent challenge in this domain is the sluggish ion migration kinetics associated with the large ionic radii of Na+ ions, which significantly impact high&#8208;energy output applications, such as acceleration and climbing. Herein, a concept of Capacitance&#8208;Enhanced Battery (CEB) is proposed that leverages an ultra&#8208;large MXene framework interfaced with a Bi2S3@ZnS composite(hereafter abbreviated as BiZnS) to form a C@BiZnS@V4C3 heterostructure for reaching a dynamic dual&#8208;mechanism response. At low current densities, the system operates predominantly in a battery mode, wherein sodium&#8208;ion alloying and conversion reactions within the BiZnS framework ensure high energy retention. At high current densities, the heterostructure facilitates a supercapacitive mode, where active sites at the MXene and BiZnS surfaces and interfaces engage in rapid ion adsorption&#8211;desorption, enabling instantaneous energy delivery. This dual functionality imparts exceptional electrochemical performance of the Na&#8208;ion batteries, with a remarkable specific capacity of 270.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 100 A g&#8722;1 and extraordinary durability, maintaining outstanding electrochemical stability over 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. These findings underscore the transformative potential of CEBs and establish dual&#8208;mechanism electrodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Stacking III&#8208;Nitride Ultraviolet&#8208;B Light Emitters with High Efficiency via a Lattice&#8208;Engineered Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;engineered architecture through in situ surface pretreatment is proposed, by which dense and discrete nanocrystalline graphite (NC graphite) masks, owing to the decomposition of metal organics, are introduced to bring about controllable epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Stress in AlN is then continuously modulated from a compressive state to a high tensile one of 2.51 GPa with a strain of 0.51%.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light emitters in the range of 280&#8211;320&#160;nm (UVB band) show irreplaceable prospects in the field of medical care, but suffer from a low&#8208;efficiency issue known as the &#8220;UVB gap.&#8221; This issue stems from the large lattice mismatch between low&#8208;Al&#8208;content AlGaN and AlN, which causes the AlGaN epilayer to endure a significant compressive stress during structural stacking, resulting in dislocation multiplication and surface roughening, and thus seriously deteriorating the device performance. Herein, a lattice&#8208;engineered architecture through surface pretreatment is proposed, by which dense and discrete nanocrystalline graphite masks, formed by the decomposition of metal organics, are introduced to bring about controllable epitaxial lateral overgrowth and consequent stress. The stress in AlN is then continuously modulated from a compressive to a tensile state of 2.51&#160;GPa with a strain of 0.51%, making its in&#8208;plane lattice constant equivalent to that of freestanding Al0.79Ga0.21N. As such, high&#8208;quality full&#8208;Al&#8208;content AlGaN epitaxy, in particular with an Al content below 50%, is realized, which brings about a significant performance improvement in 310&#8208;nm UVB LEDs, with a maximum wall&#8208;plug efficiency achieving 4.88%. This study makes a major breakthrough in the stacking of AlGaN&#8208;based UVB light emitters and definitely speeds up their further applications.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Water Transport Properties in Thiol&#8208;yne Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigorous understanding of thiol&#8208;yne crystallization in a series of stoichiometrically identical stereocontrolled elastomers with variations in cis vs trans backbone stereochemistry provides a path forward to design and utilize structural elements in films for barrier applications. Varying the isomer content in these elastomers directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior which affords control overmicron&#8208;scale structure.








Abstract
Barrier polymers underpin almost every commercial sector, yet the needs of several emerging areas remain unmet by commercially&#8208;available materials, including temporary orthopedic implants, transient health monitors, neural implants, and other long&#8208;term implants. The ability to tune polymer composition independently of polymer structure positions thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry as a promising platform to serve these emerging technologies. This work describes the differences in the hierarchical structure of stoichiometrically identical materials which differ only in the proportion of the cis versus trans backbone alkene stereochemistry. Varying the isomer content in this way directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior, which affords control over micron&#8208;scale structure. This investigation focuses on how these stereochemical features affect the water vapor permeation process by several methods and develops an understanding of how this unique structural regularity improves barrier performance relative to a commercially available water barrier polymer, poly(ethylene terephthalate).

         <title>Proteolysis&#8208;triggered RNA Interference for Mitochondrial Iron Dyshomeostasis to Activate Antitumor Immunity in Hepatic Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;triggering proteolysis RNA interference system (namely cRGD&#8208;VFs) is elaborately designed. Specifically, cRGD&#8208;VFs release abundant Fe2+ by self &#8208;triggering proteolysis of the ferritin shell and ENO1&#8208;targeted siRNA for the regulation of ENO1&#8208;IRP1&#8208;Mfrn1 pathway, which synergistically induce severe mitochondrial iron dyshomeostasis, resulting in immunogenic tumor cell death and activating strong antitumor immunity to eliminate hepatic carcinoma.








Abstract
Although the disturbance of iron metabolism holds significant promise for antitumor therapy, the specific regulation of the precise acting site remains challenging. Here, a self&#8208;triggering proteolysis RNA interference system (cRGD&#8208;VFs) is elaborately constructed to precisely disturb mitochondrial iron homeostasis, the core hub of cellular iron regulation, for evoking antitumor immunity. Specifically, ferritin is conjugated with E3 ligase ligand VH032 and tumor&#8208;targeting cRGD peptide through click chemistry, and further loaded with ENO1&#8208;targeted siRNA to prepare cRGD&#8208;VFs. Following the targeted uptake by tumor cells, cRGD&#8208;VFs recruits E3 ligase to initiate the ubiquitination process to trigger the proteolysis of ferritin, resulting in the release of abundant Fe2+ and the loaded siRNA. siRNA&#8208;mediated ENO1&#8208;targeted knockdown would upregulate the mitochondrial iron transport channel through the ENO1&#8208;IRP1&#8208;Mfrn1 pathway, which subsequently leads to mitochondrial iron overload and the increase of detrimental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby triggering severe mitochondria destruction and causing mass death of tumor cells. Noteworthily, it is found that cRGD&#8208;VFs&#8208;mediated mitochondrial iron overload can activate powerful antitumor immunity by upregulating immune&#8208;related pathways to eliminate tumors, achieving notable tumor suppression in multiple murine liver cancer models, which represents a promising strategy of disturbing mitochondrial iron homeostasis for potentiating antitumor immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
Squid bone&#8208;derived carboxylated &#946;&#8208;chitin nanofibers (1.2 &#215; 2.2 nm) form ultra&#8208;permeable membranes achieving record water flux (46 207 L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;bar&#8722;1) with complete rejection of nanoplastics (100% for 50&#8211;100 nm) and &gt;99% removal of organic dyes. Electrostatic repulsion&#8208;enhanced porosity enables breakthrough performance, validated by mathematical modeling. Life cycle and techno&#8208;economic analyses confirm scalable eco&#8208;solutions for water purification and waste valorization.








Abstract
As emerging contaminants like nanoplastics, organic dyes, and inorganic particles proliferate, traditional water purification faces significant challenges. Here, a novel solution grounded in sustainability and efficiency: ultra&#8208;permeable membranes crafted from carboxylated &#946;&#8208;chitin nanofibers derived from squid bone is introduced. The 124&#8208;nm&#8208;thick membrane exhibits an exceptional pure water flux of 46 207 L&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1 with complete rejection (100%) of 100&#160;nm nanoplastics. The 247&#8208;nm&#8208;thick membrane achieves 100% rejection of 50&#160;nm nanoplastics, whereas the 1.8&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick membrane attains 99.2% rejection of 1.5&#160;nm rhodamine B dye. The breakthrough performance is attributed to the nanofibers' ultrafine dimensions (1.2 &#215; 2.2&#160;nm) and enhanced porosity resulting from carboxylate&#8208;mediated electrostatic repulsion. The mathematical models substantiate that this optimized porosity dramatically enhances filtration efficacy. Moreover, life cycle and techno&#8208;economic assessments affirm the approach's sustainability and economic feasibility. By marrying advanced material science with circular economy principles, this squid bone&#8208;derived membrane not only tackles global water purification challenges but also exemplifies how nature&#8208;inspired innovation can lead to scalable, eco&#8208;friendly solutions.

         <title>Photoinduced Cation Coupled Electron Transfer for Efficient Ionic Power Harvesting Based on CNT/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic CNT/MoS2 nanofluidic system, inspired by photosynthetic proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, enables photo&#8208;driven active ion transport in isotonic electrolytes through synergistic photothermal&#8208;photoelectric coupling, achieving robust ionic energy harvesting and opening new avenues for sustainable photoiontronics.








Abstract
Inspired from the light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer during photosynthesis in green plants, an engineered CNT/MoS2 biomimetic nanofluidic system has been successfully developed, which achieves photo&#8208;activated ion transport in iso&#8208;concentration electrolytes through synergistic photothermal&#8208;photoelectric coupling.

&lt;p&gt;A biomimetic CNT/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanofluidic system, inspired by photosynthetic proton-coupled electron transfer, enables photo-driven active ion transport in isotonic electrolytes through synergistic photothermal-photoelectric coupling, achieving robust ionic energy harvesting and opening new avenues for sustainable photoiontronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired from the light-driven proton-coupled electron transfer during photosynthesis in green plants, an engineered CNT/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; biomimetic nanofluidic system has been successfully developed, which achieves photo-activated ion transport in iso-concentration electrolytes through synergistic photothermal-photoelectric coupling. Under light irradiation, localized photothermal effects in CNT generate a temperature gradient, driving thermophoretic ion migration, while the same irradiation triggers a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated surface charge gradient via photoexcited carrier redistribution, encompassing both vertical charge transfer and horizontal carrier diffusion. The resultant dual gradients of surface charge asymmetry and temperature differential cooperatively drive autonomous ion pumping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the temperature gradient dominates the initial unidirectional migration of ions, whereas the surface charge gradient further enhances active ion transport. The synergistic interplay of these gradients yields a unidirectional ion flux, enabling efficient ionic energy harvesting with an output power density of 18.98&#160;mW&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy conversion efficiency of 8.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;%.

         <title>Ion Valency as a Molecular Switch for Salt&#8208;Resistant Underwater Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monovalent K+ ions weaken adhesion by forming K+&#8208;&#960; complexes with weak bridging capacity. In contrast, multivalent cations like Y3+ enhance adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; bridging networks, which are resistant to salt and capable of compensating for the loss of native &#960;&#8211;&#960; and NH3+&#8208;&#960; interactions. Through these contrasting effects, K+ and Y3+ function as molecular switches that regulate adhesion in cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;based adhesive systems.








Abstract
Achieving underwater adhesion remains challenging due to the disruption of interfacial interactions by hydration layers and the ionic environment. This study shows how high adhesion in a saline environment can be achieved in adhesive peptide systems relying on &#960;&#8211;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions using multivalent ions. Monovalent ions (K+) disrupt native peptide&#8208;peptide interactions, drastically reducing adhesion strength. Conversely, multivalent ions (Mg2+ and Y3+) enable robust interfacial adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; networks, effectively compensating for disrupted native pairings. The adhesion enhancement by Y3+ is particularly pronounced, highlighting its unique capability for multidentate bridging. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical analyses confirm that Y3+ ions stabilize extended interfacial interactions, enabling stronger stress dissipation during tensile deformation. Additionally, NMR spectroscopy supports these observations by demonstrating significant cation&#8208;dependent perturbations of aromatic (Phe) and cationic (Lys) peptide residues. A thermodynamic model further elucidates the competitive binding dynamics underpinning adhesion modulation and capturing all experimental trends. This work provides detailed molecular insights into ion valency effects on cation&#8208;&#960; mediated underwater adhesion, guiding the development of bio&#8208;inspired materials with tailored ionic responsiveness suitable for biomedical and technological applications in saline environments.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Ruthenium&#8211;Amino Acid Conjugates Enable Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8211;Nucleus Cascade Targeting for Cell Pyroptosis and DNA Destruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;assembly delivery nanoplatform based on the direct coordination of amino acids with a Ru(II) center is developed, enabling targeting from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus to induce pyroptosis and DNA damage. This distinctive conjugate achieved high therapeutic efficacy through combined photodynamic therapy and photoactivated chemotherapy, providing a transformative framework for the rational design of metallodrugs.








Abstract
The distinct photophysical and photochemical properties of ruthenium (Ru) complexes have made them potent therapeutic agents in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) for tumors. Simple synthesis, precise self&#8208;assembly delivery and specific subcellular distribution are essential for Ru complexes but remain significant challenges. Herein, a simple building block, Fmoc&#8211;methionine (Fmoc&#8211;M), is directly coordinated with a Ru center to construct a pH and light responsive Ru&#8211;amino acid conjugate (FmocRu), which directly self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles, thus avoiding using polymeric and inorganic nanocarriers. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, the acidic microenvironment protonated the carboxyl groups in the amino acids, disrupting the supramolecular force balance and reducing particle size to enhance tumor penetration. The newly&#8208;formed small nanospheres exhibit programmable cascade targeting by first accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum, then rapidly disassembling upon light irradiation to enable nuclear delivery of the released Ru complexes. This feature enabled FmocRu to induce cell death via the pyroptosis pathway and DNA damage. As a result, the Ru conjugate eliminated subcutaneous tumors and suppressed orthotopic breast tumor growth and metastasis in tumor&#8208;bearing mice model, offering a valuable platform to develop Ru complexes for anticancer research in PDT and PACT.

         <title>Unlocking Grotthuss Proton Energy Storage in Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Tungsten Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel trace&#8208;Ni2+&#8208;implanted pyrochlore&#8208;type tungsten oxide is developed to showcase unique Grotthuss proton conduction abilities based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding topochemistry, which has realized ultrafast and stable electrochemical proton storage performance in aqueous proton batteries up to 500C.








Abstract
It is of momentous significance to identify suitable proton&#8208;storage electrode materials inherent with Grotthuss topochemistry toward high&#8208;power aqueous proton batteries. However, currently reported oxide electrode materials have seldom conformed to the Grotthuss mechanism. Here Grotthuss mechanism&#8208;dominated proton storage is showcased in a novel 3D&#8208;tunnel&#8208;structured pyrochlore&#8208;type WO3&#183;0.5H2O (WOH), together with a reliable and effective approach to amplifying its Grotthuss conduction effect. Different from other phases of tungsten oxide (e.g., orthorhombic, monoclinic, and hexagonal), the zeolitic&#8208;water&#8208;enriched cubic pyrochlore WOH favors proton&#8208;hopping akin to &#8220;Newton's cradle&#8221; instead of traditional &#8220;vehicle&#8208;like&#8221; transport. Interestingly, introducing trace Ni(II) ions into the WOH (NWOH) is find to notably increase the content of structural water in lattice, thereby reframing the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network along with enhanced proton transfer capability as a consequence of its largely reduced activation energy as low as 0.08 eV. Hence, NWOH shows boosted reversible capacity of 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100C, ultrafast charging capability up to 500C, and ultralong cycling life over 30,000 cycles. Once coupled with Prussian blue analogue cathodes with identical Grotthuss conduction mechanism, the resultant high&#8208;output&#8208;voltage full&#8208;cells (&#8776;1.1 V) sustain high&#8208;rate cycling with high energy/power density and operate at a wide working temperature from &#8722;20 to 50&#160;&#176;C.

         <dc:description>
An integrated porous cathode/composite polymer electrolyte is successfully fabricated by using dynamic reversible nature of Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) chemistry, imparting solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with continuous Li&#8314; transport networks to achieve excellent cycling stability (30&#160;000 cycles at 10 C). 3D printing technique enables the production of customizable batteries with complex geometries, highlighting the potential for application in personalized electronics.








Abstract
Customized solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with high safety hold promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, yet they suffer from rapid capacity decay due to unstable solid&#8208;solid interfaces and uneven Li+ transport. To break the bottleneck, an in situ 3D&#8208;printed integrated porous cathode/composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) is developed using reversible Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) covalent chemistry. Typically, the reversible crosslinked CPE are produced from a furan&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol oligomer, tris&#8208;(2&#8208;maleimidoethyl)amine, and maleimide&#8208;modified Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12. During the thermal printing of CPE, its viscosity significantly decreases due to the dissociation of DA bonds in polymeric matrix and the ceramic particle/polymer interfaces, allowing the CPE to diffuse into the pre&#8208;printed porous cathode and form a continuous Li+ transport network. Upon cooling, the DA crosslinkages reform to create a robustly adaptive interface layer with low impedance and uniform Li deposition during battery operation. The resulting integrated system achieves remarkable cycling stability in SSLMBs, with 30&#160;000 cycles at 10 C in LiFePO4||Li cells and stable Li plating/stripping over 4150&#160;h in symmetric cells. Moreover, the 3D printing technique enables the fabrication of customized batteries and integrated functional devices that maintain stable operation under mechanical deformation, showing potential for wearable and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Oriented Nanochannel Aerogels for High&#8208;Transconductance Organic Transistors and Ultrasensitive Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differently oriented nanochannel semiconductor aerogels are developed via a liquid crystal templating strategy. Compared with dense and random (or horizontal) porous structures, the vertical nanochannel structure shows significantly enhanced ion penetration/transport, enabling an ultrahigh transconductance (118.5 mS) of organic electrochemical transistors. The vertical nanochannel aerogel&#8208;based multi&#8208;channel microfluidic biosensor system exhibits ultralow detection limits in response to different biomarkers.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are promising for various sensors, but their transconductance and sensitivity are restricted by limited ion penetration/transport of dense active layers. Here, inspired by oriented biological ion channels, differently oriented nanochannel semiconductor aerogels and the aerogel&#8208;based OECTs are developed via a liquid crystal templating strategy. Compared with dense and random (or horizontal) porous structures, the vertical nanochannel structure shows significantly enhanced ion penetration/transport, enabling an ultrahigh transconductance of 118.5 mS, significantly higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECTs with a similar channel size. The vertical nanochannel OECT&#8208;based multi&#8208;channel microfluidic biosensor system exhibits ultralow detection limits of 1 pM, 0.01 fg mL&#8722;1, and 0.1 pM in response to uric acid, immunoglobulin G, and deoxyribonucleic acid, respectively, approximately one to three orders of magnitude lower than those of dense devices. It can detect trace amounts of different biomolecules in body fluids like urine and serum for accurate disease diagnosis/prevention. This work presents a versatile strategy for creating oriented nanochannel materials and electronics for various advanced applications.

         <title>Single Organic Cation Engineering Cu(I)&#8208;Based Ionic and Coordinate Type Halides as High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogel Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed two Cu(I)&#8208;based hybrid metal halides, Cu2I4&#8208;IC (Ionic compound) and water&#8208;stable Cu4I4&#8208;CC (Coordination compound), by bonding mode control engineering, and develops a high&#8208;performance scintillator hydrogel based on Cu4I4&#8208;CC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;H2O/DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide), demonstrating excellent X&#8208;ray imaging performance and environmental stability.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based halide scintillators are promising candidates for X&#8208;ray detection due to excellent scintillation and low&#8208;cost solution processability. However, the rational design of Cu(I)&#8208;based halide scintillators remains challenging due to insufficient theoretical frameworks elucidating their structure&#8208;property correlations. In this work, two Cu(I)&#8208;based hybrid metal halides, Cu2I4&#8208;IC (Ionic compound) are designed and Cu4I4&#8208;CC (Coordination compound) via bonding mode control engineering. The Cu2I4&#8208;IC exhibits blue emission, and the Cu4I4&#8208;CC exhibits yellow emission, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cu2I4&#8208;IC and Cu2I4&#8208;IC are 91% and 100% respectively. The non&#8208;radiative transitions are reduced due to the high rigidity of Cu4I4, resulting in a light yield up to 67&#160;500 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a detection limit as low as 47.3 nGy s&#8722;1 of Cu4I4&#8208;CC. Additionally, a high&#8208;performance scintillator hydrogel based on Cu4I4&#8208;CC with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),H2O and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)&#160;is innovatively developed. Owing to the high transmittance, the large&#8208;area scintillator hydrogel film (10 &#215; 10 cm2) achieves an X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 14 lp mm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of hydrogen bonding and coordination bonding endow the hydrogel scintillator with excellent plasticity and flexible stretchability.&#160;The Cu4I4&#8208;CC@PVA hydrogel proves promising for X&#8208;ray imaging with excellent stability in harsh environments, matching state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scintillators.

         <title>Reconfigurable and Giant Bulk Ionicphotovoltaic Effect in 2D Quaternary Metal Thio(Seleno)Phosphates Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal bulk ionicphotovoltaic effect is revealed in 2D quaternary metal thio(seleno)phosphates crystals. The reversible ion migration within 2D CuBiP2Se6 channel, driven by an electric field, leads to the conductance rectification with a high ratio exceeding 103, and facilitates the giant and programmable short&#8208;circuit current of 1.6 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, with an ideal nonlinearity factor of 0.09.








Abstract
Lamed by the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit, complex device architectures and material selection, traditional photovoltaic (PV) technologies based on heterojunctions are difficult to implement reconfigurable PV generation with high power efficiency. Here, the universal bulk ionicphotovoltaic (BIPV) effect in 2D quaternary metal thio(seleno)phosphates (QMTPs) crystals is reported, and demonstrates the giant photocurrent generation with excellent reconfigurability. The programmable ion migration driven by an electric field not only leads to the in&#8208;plane electric potential gradient, but also contributes to the reversible modulation of crystal inversion asymmetry. The formation of reconfigurable in&#8208;plane homojunction in 2D CuBiP2Se6 channel results into the pronounced conductance rectification with a high ratio exceeding 103, contributing to an extremely large short&#8208;circuit PV current density of 1.6 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 under 532 nm illumination, among the highest values of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D PV devices. More importantly, the electric potential gradient and degree of centrosymmetric of 2D QMTPs channel can be precisely controlled by the direction and magnitude of programming voltage pulses, which enables the linearly programmed BIPV current generation with an ideal nonlinearity factor of 0.09. The photoelectric conversion relying on the BIPV effect breaks the integration bottleneck of reconfigurability and power efficiency, providing a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation PV devices.

         <title>Graph Neural Network Driven Exploration of Non&#8208;Precious Metal Catalysts for Air&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning&#8208;driven microkinetic framework, based on graph neural networks is developed, for screening non&#8208;noble catalysts in NH2OH hydrogenation. This approach enables the discovery of efficient catalysts for plasma&#8211;electrochemical ammonia synthesis directly from air under ambient conditions. CuMnSb is identified as a top&#8208;performing, sustainable candidate among all synthesizable alloy phases.








Abstract
Efficient ammonia production directly from the air with minimal energy consumption remains one of the most challenging and ambitious scientific goals. NH2OH has proven to be a promising stable intermediate in producing NH3, with the direct generation of NH3 from air achieved by coupling a continuous flow plasma reactor with an electrolyzer. However, the requirement of noble metal&#8208;doped Cu alloys as the cathode catalyst limits the scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the coupled plasma&#8208;electrochemical system. In this work, graph neural networks, density functional theory calculations, and microkinetic modeling are combined to exhaustively explore the catalytic properties of all experimentally accessible alloy phases for NH3 production, ultimately identifying the non&#8208;noble CuMnSb system as highly active for the conversion of air to NH3. The experiments confirm an ammonia production rate of 28.47 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a coupled plasma&#8208;electrolyser system. Such a finding confirms the future of machine learning and microkinetic theory in guiding the experimental exploration that transcends the constraints of conventional methods.

         <title>Breakdown Resistant Dielectrics and Self&#8208;Extinguishing Engineering for Air Breakdown</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are critical for powering the Internet of Things, yet their development is significantly hindered by breakdown problems. This work proposes a strategy to synergistically enhance the breakdown resistance of air and dielectric applying a single aluminum nitride coating, thereby improving TENG output performance and operational stability, offering insights for developing high&#8208;performance and durable TENGs.








Abstract
The increasing energy demands of Internet of Things devices necessitate high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, the performance of TENGs is severely constrained by air and dielectric breakdown, which not only limits the energy output but also accelerates dielectric degradation and device failure. Here, a strategy is proposed to synergistically enhance the breakdown resistance and facilitate self&#8208;extinguishing of air breakdown by introducing an aluminum nitride (AlN) coating on dielectrics. The coating improves thermal dissipation capability and modulates the electric field and energy level distribution, enhancing dielectric breakdown resistance. Additionally, a spontaneously induced reversed electric field effectively suppresses air breakdown, preventing excessive discharge damage. Consequently, the modified polyimide (PI) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) exhibit significant improvements in both air and dielectric breakdown resistance. Corresponding TENGs achieve &#8776; 50% increase in energy density and prominently extend operational stability by over 360 folds. This work provides insights into the thermal and interfacial processes of air breakdown, promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and durable TENGs.

         <title>Selective Crystallization Delay in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Enables Initial Homogeneous Phase for Square Centimeter Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film with initially homogeneous phase distribution is obtained by using 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide additive, which selectively suppresses bromide precipitation during crystallization to mitigate halide phase segregation while demonstrating weak size dependence. The resulting 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandem solar cells achieved a remarkable 25.21% power conversion efficiency, coupled with impressive operational stability maintaining &#8776;90% initial performance over 1500 h.








Abstract
Mixed halide wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, used in high&#8208;performance perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs), are prone to phase segregation under light irradiation. Particularly, the initial inhomogeneous halide phase distribution in WBG perovskites can accelerate the phase segregation under operational stressors, thus hindering scaling of TSCs that require high phase homogeneity. Here, a selective delayed crystallization strategy is proposed in which a functional agent (3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide; AFBA) is used to regulate the initial halide phase distribution. The &#8208;NH2 of AFBA, with a low electron&#8208;cloud density, shows a higher binding affinity with bromide than with iodide, thus selectively delaying the rapid crystallization of bromide; this phenomenon induces a homogeneous halide distribution across the film. The initial homogeneous film is phase&#8208;stable under operational stressors. As a result, the square&#8208;centimeter WBG perovskite front cell achieves a high efficiency of 18.61%. When stacked with organic subcells, the square&#8208;centimeter perovskite/organic TSC exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 25.21%, showing a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size from 0.062 to 2.000 cm2, as well as a prolonged operational lifetime with a T90 of 1500&#160;h. Perovskite/organic TSCs are also connected in series with electrochromic devices to dynamically monitor the TSC performance via the color variation, providing insights for their future applications.

         <title>Confined Polymer Electrolyte Synthesis in Porous Frameworks for Cold&#8208;Climate Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A Zn2+&#8208;conductive solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is fabricated by in situ polymerization of 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (EtOx) within sulfonated porous aromatic frameworks (SPAF). The solvation effect of PEtOx and the anchoring effect of SPAF synergistically promote the transport of Zn2+ ions, reduce the migration energy barrier, and improve the performance of the battery at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are vital for zinc&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state batteries (ZSSBs) for dendrite suppression but face low&#8208;temperature hurdles from poor ionic conductivity and crystallization. Here, a supramolecularly engineered SPE is constructed by in situ polymerization of 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (EtOx) within sulfonated porous aromatic frameworks (SPAFs), acting as macroinitiators and nanoconfined reactors. Resulting poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEtOx) chains assemble with the SPAF via strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, forming cohesive SPAF&#8208;PEtOx (SPP) with interconnected ion transport pathways. &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups anchor Zn2+, while confined PEtOx chains modulate solvation dynamics, facilitating efficient Zn2+ migration. SPE based on SPP embedded in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#160;matrices (SPP@PVDF) achieves high ionic conductivity (5.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical window (2.74&#160;V) at room temperature. A Zn || Zn symmetric battery exhibits stable plating/stripping over 3000&#160;h, while a full Zn || V2O5 battery retains capacity over 1000 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with no decay. Notably, the ionic conductivity of SPP@PVDF at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C is 8&#8208;fold higher than SPAF@PVDF, as PEtOx reduces Zn2+ migration barriers. This work offers a molecular&#8208;level strategy for designing cryogenically robust SPEs, advancing ZSSB technologies for extreme environments.

Dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and transformation mechanism is investigated using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, including 0D carbon nanocage and fullerene, 1D nanotube and 3D graphite. The critical temperature and pressure of nanocarbon precursors becomes more stringent as their dimensionalities rise up. This work can shed light on the controllable preparation of diamond and related materials.








Abstract
Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensionalities is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, the imperative dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and the physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure is reported, by comparing the distinct transition processes of 0D carbon nanocages (CNCs) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrate that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure&#8208;temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimensionality effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Guided Ion Orchestration for Multi&#8208;Chemistry Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is developed to stabilize zinc metal batteries. By leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers and solvation configurations, the EF&#8208;IO design enables ultra&#8208;long cyclability and wide temperature adaptability. It also unlocks new reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes, advancing multi&#8208;chemistry zinc battery designs.








Abstract
While nonaqueous cosolvents alleviate hydrogen evolution reaction and dendritic growth in aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs), persistent H2O activity at Zn|electrolyte interfaces originating from unregulated ion distribution leads to premature failure. Here, an electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is proposed, leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers (EDLs) and solvation configurations. Interfacial simulations combined with experimental investigations verify that the ion&#8208;orchestrated&#8208;EDL synergistically diversifies Zn2+/Na+ solvation configurations and homogenizes localized electric fields, thereby forming an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that suppresses parasitic reactions. This enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating with 3400&#160;h cyclability in Zn||Zn symmetric cells, while Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O full cells exhibit exceptional durability along with wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;45 to 55&#160;&#176;C). Crucially, this EF&#8208;IO strategy unlocks ClO4&#8722;&#8208;based reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes. By bridging interfacial dynamics and multi&#8208;chemistry compatibility, this work establishes a promising paradigm for robust and versatile ZMBs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustainable, Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Triboelectric Nanogenerator for In Situ Powering of Marine Internet of Things</title>

         <dc:description>
By synergizing charge supplementation with a multiphase electrode strategy, record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh durability and power output for TENGs is achieved, and further integrated a self&#8208;developed ultralow&#8208;power management circuit to enable fully self&#8208;sustained, continuous operation of marine IoT nodes with GPS functionality&#8212;powered solely by TENG energy.








Abstract
The sustainable operation of marine Internet of Things (IoT), as a critical enabler for marine resource utilization, is hindered by the lack of robust energy solutions capable of powering advanced functionalities in unpredictable oceanic environments. Here, a self&#8208;sustainable, highly reliable triboelectric nanogenerator system is presented that synergizes a non&#8208;contact architecture with dynamic charge supplementation and multiphase electrode design to overcome persistent limitations in durability, energy storage, and water wave adaptability. The system achieves a 3&#8208;fold enhancement in output charge with 97% performance retention over 20 million cycles&#8212;5.2 times more durable than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts. A chaotic double&#8208;pendulum structure further broadens operational bandwidth to 0.4&#8211;1.0 Hz with the charge accumulation rate of 4.6 times, enabling record&#8208;breaking average power density of 13.53 W m&#8722;3 Hz&#8722;1. Furthermore, an adaptive ultralow&#8208;powered (244 nW) integrated management circuit with on&#8208;demand direct current supply functionality ensures a 394&#8208;fold energy storage speed, successfully sustaining real&#8208;time GPS communication and water quality monitoring in autonomous buoys. This work establishes a scalable, maintenance&#8208;free paradigm for marine energy harvesting, directly addressing the energy paradox in IoT deployment while advancing sustainable resource management and climate resilience strategies.

         <title>Autonomous Signaling and Recording of Electrical and Photodegradation in Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric polymers play a crucial role in optoelectronic spin devices. However, during long&#8208;term operation, they are prone to photo&#8208;aging or electrical degradation, which cannot be visually detected. By incorporating fluorescent indicators, self&#8208;monitoring and permanent recording of the aging process are enabled, providing a low&#8208;cost and convenient method for dielectric failure early warning in electrical equipment and systems.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers are crucial to optoelectronic and spintronic devices. However, electrical stress and/or light irradiation significantly accelerate polymer degradation and can trigger catastrophic failures of many devices, especially in the presence of oxygen. The detection and early warning of these degradations remain challenging. Herein, a class of versatile fluorescent markers is introduced, capable of autonomously signaling and recording both electrical and photodegradation through a visually discernible warning characterized by pronounced fluorescent color changes (up to 195&#160;nm redshift). These changes, induced by chemical reactions between embedded fluorophore indicators and oxygen or radicals generated during degradation, provide quantitative insights into the electrical properties of the polymers. Further, these fluorescent indicators demonstrate superior sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of nmol (several times lower than the best reported values), rapid response (less than 5 s, the highest speed ever reported) to radicals, good memory behavior, excellent generality, and robust resistance to false&#8208;positive signals compared to conventional methods, thus providing a robust approach to mitigate or even eliminate the risk of device failure.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Quasi&#8208;BIC&#8208;Driven Emission Enhancement via Quantum Dots&#8208;Hydrogel Integrated Meta&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic QDs&#8208;hydrogel integrated meta&#8208;crystal is demonstrated for active tuning quasi&#8208;BIC and enhanced PL emission. Leveraging the humidity&#8208;scalable behavior of the hydrogel, the meta&#8208;crystal enables dynamic control of quasi&#8208;BIC in the visible range. Furthermore, QDs&#8208;integrated meta&#8208;crystal radiates a narrowband (5 nm) PL with twofold enhancement and a divergence angle of 1.4&#176;, and inherits active tuning capability for the radiation wavelength.









Abstract
Optical manipulation of incoherent light is essential for light&#8208;emitting fields and nanophotonic devices. The integration of luminescent materials with metasurfaces enables the flexible wavefront engineering of spontaneous emission, offering unprecedented opportunities for incoherent light manipulation. However, current light&#8208;emitting strategies are mostly based on the static resonant structure, and it remains a challenge to realize dynamic control for photoluminescence (PL) enhancement via active mechanisms. Here, a quantum dots (QDs)&#8208;hydrogel integrated meta&#8208;crystal platform for actively tuning of quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (quasi&#8208;BIC) is demonstrated along with its shaped PL emission. The meta&#8208;crystal supports quasi&#8208;BIC resonance with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandwidth (&#8776;3.2&#160;nm, quality factor &#8776;200) in the visible range, which can be notably tuned by &#8776;10&#160;nm due to the hydrogel humidity&#8208;scalable behavior. Furthermore, due to the quasi&#8208;BIC shaping, such QDs&#8208;integrated meta&#8208;crystal radiates a narrowband (5&#160;nm) PL with two fold enhancement and a divergence angle of 1.4&#176;, and it also inherits active tuning capability for the radiation wavelength peak during the hydrogel scalable process. Such tunable light&#8208;emitting meta&#8208;crystal platform provides a promising approach for incoherent radiation control and biocompatible fluorescence imaging.

The meta-crystal supports quasi-BIC resonance with an ultra-narrow bandwidth (&#8776;3.2&#160;nm, quality factor &#8776;200) in the visible range, which can be notably tuned by &#8776;10&#160;nm due to the hydrogel humidity-scalable behavior. Furthermore, due to the quasi-BIC shaping, such QDs-integrated meta-crystal radiates a narrowband (5&#160;nm) PL with two fold enhancement and a divergence angle of 1.4&#176;, and it also inherits active tuning capability for the radiation wavelength peak during the hydrogel scalable process. Such tunable light-emitting meta-crystal platform provides a promising approach for incoherent radiation control and biocompatible fluorescence imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Fiber Oxidation in 4D</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of porous carbon fiber heat shield material at high temperatures is imaged using time&#8208;resolved synchrotron X&#8208;ray microtomography. Resolving the interplay between species diffusion and carbon&#8208;oxygen reaction rate reveals spatially and temporally varying degradation across oxidation regimes, with profound implications for in&#8208;depth material properties, structural integrity, and the predictive design of aerospace thermal protection systems.








Abstract
The oxidation of carbon fibers at high temperatures is the primary degradation process in the thermal protection system of many hypersonic flight vehicles. Predicting the rate and the extent of oxidation is critical to ensure a safe and effective design. An oversized thermal protection system adds unnecessary mass, while an under&#8208;designed one risks system failure and mission loss. Resolving high&#8208;temperature material degradation due to oxidation has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in designing for re&#8208;entry flight environments. Using time&#8208;resolved in situ X&#8208;ray microtomography, the oxidation of carbon fibers at high temperatures is directly imaged, resolving the two limiting degradation regimes: diffusion&#8208; and reaction&#8208;limited. The ability to resolve material degradation in time at the sub&#8208;micron scale sheds light on the ablation phenomenon and enables predictions of material constitutive properties evolving in time, with profound implications on the ability to model the aerothermal response of heat shield materials in hostile&#160;environments.

By combing high&#8208;crystal quality single&#8208;crystal diamond MEMS cantilevers with multi&#8208;mode resonance, the groundbreaking microscale ultra&#8208;high sensitivity &#8776;22 nK&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2 and resolution of 100 &#181;K thermometry is achieved. The diamond MEMS thermometry can operate over a wide temperature range from 6.5 to 380 K. This work underscores diamond MEMS resonators as a cutting&#8208;edge platform for microscale high&#8208;resolution thermometry.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation thermometry requires ultrahigh temperature sensitivity, precision, and microscale or nanoscale spatial resolution for bio&#8208;calorimetry, optoelectronic sensing, quantum science, energy storage, and thermal management of electronic devices. Current thermometry approaches based on thermocouple, resistive, and optical mechanisms suffer from various problems such as large volume, low resolution, high noise level, and narrow temperature range. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators hold great potential as thermometry due to the small size, batch fabrication, and facile integration with electrical circuits. However, mainstream silicon MEMS thermometry struggles with the trade&#8208;off between responsivity, temperature resolution, and sensitivity. In this work, we utilize the highest crystal quality single&#8208;crystal diamond and multi&#8208;mode resonance for MEMS cantilever thermometry to address these challenges. The resulting diamond MEMS thermometry exhibits unparalleled performance, with an ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of &#8776;22 nKHz&#8722;1/2, a high temperature resolution of 100 &#181;K, and a wide&#8208;temperature range from 6.5 to 380 K. The groundbreaking sensing performance highlights the versatility and transformative potential of diamond MEMS resonator as the next&#8208;generation platform for ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution temperature sensing in microscale or nanoscale space.

         <title>Variable&#8208;Temperature X&#8208;Ray Scattering Unveils the Solution Aggregation Structures and Processing Resiliency of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics with Iodinated Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable&#8208;temperature small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering is used to investigate the solution aggregation behavior and processing resiliency of high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics with an iodinated electron acceptor. The iodinated acceptor exhibits superior processing stability compared to its fluorinated counterpart. A direct link between the solution aggregation structure, active layer morphology, and photovoltaic performance is established, which can guide the optimization of device efficiency.








Abstract
Polymer photovoltaics are promising for low&#8208;cost, flexible, and lightweight power supplies. Their performance is heavily influenced by the morphology of the polymer: acceptor blend, where the aggregation structures of both components play a crucial role in charge generation, transport, and overall device performance. This study probes and resolves the solution aggregation behavior and processing resilience of high&#8208;efficiency polymer photovoltaics incorporating an iodinated electron acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, using variable&#8208;temperature small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and neutron scattering. By comparing BO&#8208;4I with its fluorinated counterpart, it is found that BO&#8208;4I exhibits excellent solution processing stability, whether in chlorobenzene or toluene. In addition, temperature&#8208;induced change in the donor:acceptor blend aggregation structure leads to significant alterations in film morphology, ultimately affecting device performance. Particularly, the stable solution aggregation structure of the BO&#8208;4I system confers processing resilience to device performance and achieves higher long&#8208;term device stability. Combining film structural analysis and device performance characterization, a structural inheritance is identified from solution to film, and determined that a organic photovoltaics&#160;polymer aggregate length of 27 &#177; 3&#160;nm in solution is a key feature for achieving optimal efficiency in polymer photovoltaics. These findings provide valuable insights and guidance for designing future polymer photovoltaic systems.

         <title>Host&#8208;Dependent Tunable Phosphorescence Based on Aromatic Heterocyclic Derivatives: Highly Efficient and Photo&#8208;Activated Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP is achieved by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. If they are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA, the resultant powders exhibit a high phosphorescence efficiency of 66.2% under ambient conditions. If the guests are doped into PDMA or PVP, the resultant films demonstrate photo&#8208;activated room temperature phosphorescence with a long lifetime of 578.6&#160;ms.








Abstract
Achieving high phosphorescence efficiency and photo&#8208;activated ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on the same molecule remains a formidable challenge. Here, a concise strategy is proposed to obtain highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. Aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA polymers to produce high phosphorescence efficiency. Impressively, the highest phosphorescence quantum yield can reach up to 66.2% at room temperature, which can be attributed to isolating the chromophore to reduce the excimer and the rigid environment from the polymer to restrict the non&#8208;radiative transitions. In addition, phosphorescence emission color can be tailored from green to deep blue by varying the guests. After aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PDMA or PVP, the phosphorescence lifetime is prolonged from 1.2 to 578.6&#160;ms. These polymers are successfully applied to multicolor displays and high&#8208;level information storage. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP materials based on the same molecule.

         <title>Inverted Device Engineering for Efficient and Bright Quantum Rod LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>

Equivalent circuit model and micro&#8208;surface analysis prove that horizontally aligned rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods films (82% in&#8208;plane dipoles) enable high outcoupling yet suffer from carrier leakage within the conventional device structure. An inverted device structure suppresses carrier leakage and achieves 31% and 20.2 % EQE in red and green QR&#8208;LEDs, respectively, unlocking the potential of anisotropic nanocrystals.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) have approached the theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE) determined by outcoupling efficiency. To achieve further improvements, novel optical designs must be explored, such as constructing optical microcavities, utilizing light scattering, or tuning the orientation of transition dipole moments (TDM). This study reports advances in red rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods (QRs) film that exhibits a high in&#8208;plane dipole orientation of 82%, achieved through shape&#8208;induced horizontal self&#8208;alignment. Also a critical issue is discovered: the carrier leakage through irregular quantum rod films, which hinders the EQE of quantum rod light&#8208;emitting diodes (QR&#8208;LEDs) and limits its competitiveness with QD&#8208;LEDs. An equivalent circuit model comprising two diodes clearly illustrates the impacts of the leakage current within conventional QR&#8208;LED structures. By transforming the QR&#8208;LEDs device structure, balanced carrier injection and suppressed leakage current are simultaneously enhanced, achieving a red QR&#8208;LEDs with a peak EQE of 31% and a peak brightness of 110&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, these strategies are applied to green dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod QRs, demonstrating a peak EQE of 20.2% with ultra&#8208;high luminance of 250&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work is expected to pave the way for further improvements in the LED performance based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>A Noninvasive and Highly Effective Inhaled Nanovaccine Based on Natural Polysaccharide for Lung Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;modified cationic vector is optimized for delivery Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) antigens. The assembled nanovaccine (dextran with N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine and 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (DDP/LLC) demonstrates potent adjuvant effects in promoting dendritic cell maturation. Remarkably, such nanovaccine demonstrates significant advantages over subcutaneous vaccination in activating of thoracic lymph node B cells and T follicular helper cells, as well as upregulation of tissue&#8208;resident memory T cells.








Abstract
Lung cancer is the most widespread malignancy globally and the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related deaths, highlighting the need for innovative treatments. Herein, a novel inhaled vaccine carrier is presented by modifying dextran (Dex) with N,N&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine (DMEN) and 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid (PBA) (Dex&#8211;DMEN&#8211;PBA, DDP). The optimized DDP demonstrates a potent adjuvant effect in promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation by multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the nanovaccine (DDP/Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)) forms through electrostatic interactions between DDP and protein antigens derived from LLC cells. Upon inhalation, it induces DC maturation, T cell activation, and germinal center B cell activation in the thoracic lymph node. In the mouse model, the inhaled DDP/LLC nanovaccine displays impressive prophylactic effects against lung cancer, with 50% of mice alive after six months and 33% surviving a subsequent challenge, indicating strong long&#8208;term immune memory. Remarkably, it surpasses subcutaneous vaccination, particularly in activating germinal center B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, and upregulating tissue&#8208;resident memory T (TRM) cells in the lung. This self&#8208;adjuvant nanovaccine effectively prevents tumor growth and induces robust immune memory, offering valuable insight for treating lung cancer and related diseases.

         <title>Ionically Conductive Elastic Polymer Binder for Ultrahigh Loading Electrode in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionically conductive elastic polymer (ICEP) binder is introduced for fabricating ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading NCM811 cathodes, offering enhanced elasticity, adhesion, and ionic conductivity for improved structural and interfacial stability. The ICEP&#8208;based ultrahigh loading cathode delivers 377.6&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1/1016.8&#160;Wh&#160;Lcell&#8722;1 (including packaging) when paired with Li metal anodes, demonstrating excellent electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Despite the increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, the development of high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes remains challenged by structural instability and poor charge transfer. Herein, an ionically conductive elastic polymer (ICEP) binder, designed to enable the fabrication of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), is introduced. The ICEP binder integrates mechanical elasticity, strong adhesion, and ionic conductivity through diverse functional groups, addressing challenges in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrode fabrication. Hydrogen bonding between the ICEP binder and NCM811 particles ensures uniform electrode morphology, forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). This stable interface mitigates surface side reactions, suppresses phase transitions in NCM811, and improves long&#8208;term electrochemical stability. Additionally, the ICEP binder enhances Li&#8208;ion diffusivity, reduces interphase resistance, and promotes faster electrochemical kinetics, while preventing solvent&#8208;drying&#8208;induced cracking. As a result, high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes (62.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2, 12.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2) are successfully fabricated with the ICEP binder and demonstrate 94.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, a double&#8208;stacked pouch&#8208;type lithium metal full cell incorporating ICEP&#8208;based cathodes achieves energy densities of 377.6&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8315;1 and 1016.8&#160;Wh&#160;Lcell&#8315;1 (including package materials), setting new benchmarks for lithium metal batteries. These findings establish ICEP as a highly effective binder for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, offering a scalable and commercially viable solution for ultrahigh&#8208;loading cathodes.

         <title>Stiff yet Tough, Moisture&#8208;Tolerant, Room Temperature Self&#8208;Healing and Thermoconductive Biomimetic Nanocomposites</title>

         <dc:description>
A layered BNNS skeleton is incorporated into a presynthesized room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane network using a solvent exchange&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy, yielding high&#8208;performance nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposites. These composites exhibit an exceptional combination of high stiffness, strength, and toughness, along with superior humidity/heat resistance, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing capability, and high thermal conductivity, making them promising for diverse applications.








Abstract
Stiff yet room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers are designed using molecularly engineered hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). However, they often suffer from high brittleness, moisture sensitivity, and limited functionality. To overcome these challenges, high&#8208;performance biomimetic nanocomposites inspired by inverse nacre structures are developed. A layered boron nitride nanosheet (BNNSs) skeleton is embedded within a previously synthesized room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane network, leveraging a solvent exchange&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy. This approach resolved the problem of BNNSs agglomeration and reconstructed robust yet dynamic noncovalent interfacial interactions, maximizing the reinforcing and toughening effects of BNNSs. Consequently, the nanocomposite exhibited significant mechanical enhancements, including 6.6&#8208;fold, 14.4&#8208;fold, 490&#8208;fold, and 35.7&#8208;fold increases in flexural modulus, strength, toughness, and fracture toughness, respectively, achieving a balance between stiffness and toughness. Furthermore, the nanocomposite retained room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing properties through the secondary relaxation of H&#8208;bonds. The impermeability of BNNSs effectively shielded H&#8208;bonds from moisture, fundamentally altering the hygroscopic nature of self&#8208;healing glassy polyurethanes. Additionally, the highly oriented and interconnected BNNSs skeleton endowed the nanocomposite with an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of up to 11.54&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, making it a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance intelligent thermal interface materials.

         <title>Durable Ceramicization&#8208;Induced Uncoated Superhydrophobic Surfaces for Anti&#8208;Icing Propeller Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;durable superhydrophobic anti&#8208;icing surfaces have been successfully realized using laser&#8208;processed silicone rubber surfaces to form ceramicized microstructures. The laser&#8208;processed silicone rubber surface has a static delayed icing time of 2880 s and a dynamic anti&#8208;icing time of 132 s in a wind tunnel. After mechanical abrasion and chemical corrosion, it still shows stable superhydrophobic performance.








Abstract
The chemical and mechanical instability of conventional coated decorative superhydrophobic anti&#8208;icing surfaces on propeller leading edges has been a major limitation for practical applications. Here, a self&#8208;starting, uncoated, and ultra&#8208;durable superhydrophobic anti&#8208;icing surface fabricated on silicone rubber via laser&#8208;induced ceramization microstructuring is demonstrated. The laser&#8208;processed surface achieves a water contact angle of 168&#176; and a sliding angle of 0.3&#176;, exhibiting a static ice delay time of 2880 s at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C and a dynamic anti&#8208;icing duration of 132 s in wind tunnel tests. Remarkably, after mechanical abrasion (&gt;600 s), chemical corrosion (&gt;240&#160;h), and 30 ice&#8208;adhesion cycles, the surface maintains stable superhydrophobicity and anti&#8208;icing performance. These properties are ascribed to the synergistic effect of laser&#8208;generated microstructures and surface ceramization, which enhance environmental durability and deicing efficiency. This work provides a viable strategy for achieving long&#8208;term anti&#8208;icing performance on equipment surfaces under extreme conditions.

         <title>Permeable, Wet&#8208;Adhesive, and EMI&#8208;Resistant Liquid Metal Electronic Skin for High&#8208;Fidelity Electrophysiological Monitoring in Sweaty and Electromagnetic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and EMI&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is developed to enable stable, high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under humid and high&#8208;interference conditions. By integrating oxidation&#8208;resistant liquid metal inks, a conductive sandwich textile structure, and a permeable adhesive layer, the e&#8208;skin offers a promising solution to the adhesion&#8211;breathability trade&#8208;off in next&#8208;generation wearable bioelectronics.








Abstract
Textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skins possess outstanding permeability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them ideal for wearable health monitoring and human&#8211;machine interfaces. However, the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between breathability and adhesiveness poses a major challenge to maintaining a stable and comfortable skin&#8211;electrode interface. This often results in elevated interfacial impedance, signal artifacts, and reduced signal fidelity under extreme conditions. Herein, a breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is engineered for stable and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring, particularly in sweaty and strong electromagnetic environments. Liquid metal particles (LMPs) are encapsulated within polysaccharide molecules to prevent surface oxidation and enhance printability. The conductive ink is directly patterned onto a sandwich&#8208;structured textile substrate, which integrates a wet&#8208;adhesive yet permeable fibrous layer, and an EMI&#8208;shielding interlayer coated with silver nanoparticles. The resulting e&#8208;skin demonstrates excellent permeability (1439.1&#160;&#177;&#160;13.3&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1), strong wet adhesion (2.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2), and robust EMI shielding effectiveness (&gt;50&#160;dB in the X&#8208;band), these advantages collectively empower comfortable, stable, and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals including electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and electrooculography (EOG), even in humid and EMI conditions. This functional synergy represents a key innovation that enhances long&#8208;term stability and fidelity in complex, real&#8208;world bio&#8208;monitoring scenarios.

         <title>Anomalous Phase Change in SbSex Memristors for Ultrafast Image Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized Joule&#8208;heating induced anomalous phase change in which it not only includes conventional phase change process (amorphous to crystalline) but also involves Sb metal nucleus growth is detected, enabling the SbSex memristor to manifest N&#8208;shape negative differential resistance that can execute ultrafast image encryption.








Abstract
Complex electrical nonlinearity process in neurons is believed to be the origin of high&#8208;level cognition, highly desired for an electronic device with rich dynamics. Here, an anomalous phase transition in the semiconducting SbSex thin film is observed in situ, which includes not only the conventional phase transition process (amorphous to crystalline) but also involves the Sb metallic nucleus growth that has never been observed before. Theoretical simulation results show that when Sb or Se vacancies are introduced into the SbSex, Joule heat will accumulate near the vacancy centers, causing an anomalous phase transition in a localized region, thereby giving the defective memristor a unique N&#8208;shape negative differential resistance (NDR) effect. These rich nonlinear electric switching dynamics provide a chaotic system for ultra&#8208;fast image encryption that is at least two orders of magnitude faster than current techniques. This work builds a novel theory horizon as well as extends brand&#8208;new application area of phase change electronics.

         <title>A 2D&#8208;3D Perovskite Memristor&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Induced Sensitized Neuron for Visual Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 2D passivated 2D&#8208;3D OHPs memristor and explores its electronic and optical properties in detail. A neural spike circuit is designed to emulate light&#8208;induced sensitized neurons. Leveraging its frequency conversion excitation characteristics and wavelength selectivity, the visual image color filtering processing and the improved sensitized spiking neural network for computer image recognition are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Implementing Leaky Integrate&#8208;and&#8208;Fire (LIF) neurons in hardware is poised to enable the creation of efficient, low&#8208;power spiking neural networks (SNNs). This is attributed to the ability of LIF neurons to mimic the rapid response and sensitivity of biological neurons, thereby reducing unnecessary computational resources. The fixed firing frequency of conventional LIF neurons limits their adaptability to complex, dynamic environments. Existing variable&#8208;frequency LIF neurons often require additional circuitry, which increases system complexity. In this study, a 2D&#8208;3D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OHPs) memristor is presented, incorporating 2D passivation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The introduction of the 2D layer increases the migration energy barrier and restricts the diffusion of ions, thus enabling the modulation of the current decay and light responsivity. By leveraging the tunable decay and wavelength selectivity of the memristor, a light&#8208;induced sensitized neuron (LISN) with an enhanced firing frequency is developed using a fundamental circuit design. Furthermore, LISN, which exhibits improved temporal processing and long&#8208;term dependency management, are integrated into sensitized spiking neural networks (SSNNs) to demonstrate their superior classification capabilities. This study underscores the potential of LISN&#8208;based neuromorphic systems in visual information processing and offers new insights for applications in complex scenarios.

         <title>Diatomic Zn&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Sphere for Microplastics Remediation in Natural Seawater at Environmentally Relevant Concentration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is presented for the in situ capture and degradation of polyester microplastics using diatomic zinc&#8208;functionalized carbon material in natural seawater at environmentally relevant concentrations. The capture of microplastics is driven by their multilevel non&#8208;covalent interactions with the high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon, while the degradation is realized by the nucleophile bridged to the dinuclear zinc sites.








Abstract
Microplastics remediation in natural seawater is challenging due to their low environmental concentrations and chemical inertia under environmental conditions. Here, a novel approach is presented for the in situ capture and degradation of polyester microplastics using zinc&#8208;functionalized carbon material, for the first time at environmentally relevant concentrations in natural seawater. The capture of microplastics is driven by their multilevel non&#8208;covalent interactions with the high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon, while the degradation is realized by the nucleophile bridged to the dinuclear zinc sites. In natural seawater, polyester microplastics are quickly enriched onto the material and depolymerized into biodegradable substances with a conversion rate of 70% in 15 weeks. The robustness of the material is demonstrated across a wide range of dissolved organic matter and impurity concentrations, highlighting its potential applicability in diverse aquatic environments. This work offers a promising approach for addressing microplastic pollution in real&#8208;world settings.

         <title>Bioinspired Flame&#8208;Retardant and Impact&#8208;Resistant Aramid Composites via Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Self&#8208;Assembly for Firefighting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening aramid composites, featuring both rigidity and flexibility through interfacial hydrogen bonding and internal boron&#8208;oxygen bonding, are developed using a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. The strength and modulus of the composite after combustion are 4006% and 2519% higher than those of shear&#8208;stiffening&#8208;gel&#8208;based Kevlar, respectively, highlighting its mechanical&#8208;thermal coupling protection. Consequently, composite&#8208;based firefighter uniforms absorbing 190.04&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 ballistic impacts are designed.








Abstract
Frequent fire accidents pose serious threats to firefighter security, necessitating progressively stringent demands on the performance of protective materials for firefighting clothing. This work proposes an advanced nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening gel (SSG)&#8208;magnesium hydroxide (MH) coating engineered aramid Kevlar composite, which exhibits exceptional anti&#8208;impact and flame&#8208;retardant properties. The SSG&#8208;MH&#8208;Kevlar (SMK) composite is fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking method, facilitating the self&#8208;assembly of SMK into a highly oriented and long&#8208;range lamellar structure. The hydrogen bonding and dynamic boron&#8208;oxygen crosslinking further enhance the interface interaction, thereby contributing to extraordinary mechanical properties superior to many commercially available fabrics. After combustion, SMK composite maintains its outstanding thermal and mechanical properties, demonstrating a 46% reduction in thermal radiation temperature and a 4006% increase in tensile strength compared to the unmodified SSG&#8208;Kevlar (SK) fabric. Post&#8208;fire SMK composite can withstand projectile impacts, maintaining shape integrity upon the 100&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 loading, whereas both Kevlar and SK composites are penetrated. Ultimately, an SMK&#8208;integrated firefighter uniform is manufactured, providing desirable defense efficiency during continuous 1&#8208;h burning and blast impact excitations. Furthermore, SMK cloth demonstrates exceptional thermal protection and stability in accordance with the GA10&#8208;2014 standard, outperforming conventional commercial firefighting uniforms.

         <title>A Microalgae&#8208;Probiotic&#8208;Nanozyme Robot for Alleviating Intestinal Inflammation and Microbiota Dysbiosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed by encapsulating Lactobacillus plantarum armed with AuCe nanozyme onto Spirulina platensis (SP@LP@AuCe) to improve gut retention, deliver antioxidant protection, and regulate microbiota composition. The SP@LP@AuCe reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, enhances probiotic viability, and restores gut microbiota balance, demonstrating superior efficacy over conventional probiotic or nanozyme therapies.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease is chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by persistent intestinal inflammation, which can lead to severe complications such as impaired intestinal barrier function and dysbiosis. Conventional therapies have challenges such as oxidative stress and insufficient intestinal colonization that hinder the treatment efficacy. Therapeutic strategies based on micro&#8208;nano robotic delivery are promising to address the limitations of current treatments by enabling precise targeting, enhancing bioavailability, and improving therapeutic outcomes. Herein, an orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed utilizing Spirulina platensis as a carrier for nanozyme&#8208;armed probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum (SP@LP@AuCe) to enhance the efficacy of oral probiotics and nanomedicine in treating intestinal diseases. SP@LP@AuCe exhibits strong fluorescence imaging capability due to its chlorophyll&#8208;rich content, allowing for non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time monitoring following oral administration. The helical structure of Spirulina platensis facilitates entrapment in intestinal villi that enhances intestinal retention. Importantly, SP@LP@AuCe scavenges reactive oxygen species and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating intestinal inflammation, improving bacterial viability, and restoring the balance of intestinal microbiota. This strategy integrates microalgae, probiotics, and nanozymes within a micro&#8208;nano robotic framework, presenting a promising approach to enhancing drug bioavailability and exerting potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in the treatment of intestinal diseases.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enhanced Modular Ionic Skin for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Discriminability in Bidirectional Human&#8211;Robot Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning&#8208;enhanced modular ionic skin with broad&#8208;spectrum multimodal sensing is realized through a synergistic material&#8211;algorithm optimization strategy. This strategy involves hard&#8208;segment&#8208;modulated 1D/2D/3D&#8208;ionic conductors and a data&#8208;driven decoupling model trained on a curated multi&#8208;stimuli dataset. Demonstrated on wearable and robotic platforms, the system exhibits promising potential for intelligent, bidirectional human&#8211;robot interaction.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception systems that mimic the functionality of human skin are able to perceive complex external stimuli, facilitating advanced applications in human&#8208;machine interactions. However, current systems still struggle with limited sensing ranges and suboptimal decoupling strategies, restricting their effective multimodal sensing. To achieve broad&#8208;spectrum multimodal discriminability, a machine learning&#8208;enhanced modular ionic skin (MIS) is developed via a synergistic sensor&#8208;algorithm optimization strategy. From the sensing material perspective, process&#8208;controlled hard&#8208;segment modulation in the ionic gel enables the development of diverse ionic conductors with enhanced sensing properties: a minimum temperature coefficient of &#8722;4.00%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 (10&#8211;160&#160;&#176;C), a linear gauge factor of 2.95 (0&#8211;100%), and a maximum pressure sensitivity of 80.5 kPa&#8722;1 (0&#8211;1.3&#160;MPa). With respect to the decoupling algorithm, a data&#8208;driven decoupling model for the MIS is meticulously proposed and trained on a dedicated multi&#8208;stimuli dataset, achieving maximum decoupling ranges for temperature and pressure with prediction errors as low as 7.0%, while maintaining reliable strain detection despite temperature interference. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated in a multimodal wearable hand kit for operator hand recognition and a robotic gripper kit for feedback, highlighting its potential in bidirectional human&#8208;robot interaction.

         <title>Sub&#8208;3 nm High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles with Triple Functionalities for Efficient Electrolytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;3 nm PtRuFeCoNiCu HEA nanoparticles are synthesized via 0.5 s ultraquick thermal shock for efficient alkaline HER. The Ru&#8208;dominated, FeCoNiCu, and Pt&#8208;rich zones act as H2O dissociation, H* diffusion, and H* combination sites, respectively, yielding an ultralow overpotential of 31.4 mV at &#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2. Practically, the assembled AEM electrolyzer shows superior performance, showing strong potential for large&#8208;scale H2 production.








Abstract

         <title>Sustained Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Quantum Dot Microfluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustained continuous&#8208;wave lasing in colloidal quantum dots is achieved by leveraging a novel microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix strategy. The novel QD microfluidic platform enables the first demonstration of 6 excitons per QD under cw excitation and hence simultaneous two&#8208;band cw stimulated emission from both the 1S and 1P states. These results open the first&#8208;ever cw QD laser device relevant for practical applications.








Abstract
Sustained amplified stimulated emission (ASE) under continuous&#8208;wave (cw) excitation is a prerequisite for any new gain material being developed for lasing applications. Despite the great success achieved in colloidal quantum dot (QD) lasers, the cw light amplification is hampered by the high pump threshold and thermal effects of QD solids. Herein, the first&#8208;ever cw ASE and lasing from QDs relevant for practical implementations are realized by adopting the microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix design. Leveraging on the transient and steady&#8208;state gain spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;concentration dispersed QDs with a gain feature customized for cw pumping render the low pump threshold (&#8776;340 W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the QD micro&#8208;liquids effectively dissipate the heat arising from the nonradiative multi&#8208;carrier recombination. As such, the unprecedented two&#8208;band cw ASE and long&#8208;lasting cw lasing with coherent output beam are realized. The findings open the door to practical QD lasers and may unlock new possibilities in optofluidics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Diverse Optical Regulations in a Single Electrochromic Layer of V2O5 via an Intrinsic Multiple Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single layer of orthorhombic V2O5 (&#945;&#8208;V2O5) can achieve diverse optical regulations, i.e., blue shift of absorption edge (multi&#8208;color variation) and dual band modulation of both visible and near&#8208;infrared light, via an intrinsic multiple phase transitions upon ion intercalation. This allows the warm mode to be compatible with other modes within a single electrochromic layer.








Abstract
Electrochromic oxides possessing the characteristics of color variation and spectra modulation are desirable for smart windows, displays, and camouflage. Here, it is reported that, upon ion intercalation, a single layer of a model phase&#8208;transition material, V2O5, can possess diverse modulation of visible and near&#8208;infrared spectra while changing color, via intrinsic multiple phase transitions. Specifically, as the phase transitions from &#945; to &#948; occur, the band transitions around 2.94 eV (420 nm) weaken, causing a blue shift in the optical absorption edge within the visible region. Simultaneously, new band transitions at 1.21 eV emerge and intensify, leading to a broad optical absorption centered around 1025 nm. As the phase transition progresses from &#948; to &#947;, the split&#8208;off bands in the &#947; phase fall below the Fermi level, which leads to a near&#8208;infrared transparent nature of &#947;&#8208;LixV2O5. Both absorption edge shifting and dynamically modulating the transmittance in V2O5 are different from other cathodic electrochromic oxides. The color&#8208;changing characteristics, together with selective spectral modulation, inspire the realization of multiple working modes for smart windows. Moreover, the optical constants of refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) at various phases for LixV2O5 are also demonstrated. It is anticipated that multiple and reversible phase transitions, which have not yet been realized, will be the key design principle for achieving superior electrochromic devices.

         <title>A Dipole&#8208;Engineered Electrolyte Paradigm to Overcome Desolvation Barriers for Exceptional Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm establishes an innovative approach beyond prevailing ion&#8208;dipole modulation framework, offering a generic&#8208;methodology for ultralow&#8208;temperature electrolyte design.








Abstract
Electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices often exhibit poor low&#8208;temperature performance due to high interfacial desolvation energy barriers. While conventional strategies targeting ion&#8208;dipole interactions have improved desolvation kinetics, they suffer from a fundamental trade&#8208;off with bulk&#8208;phase ion diffusion. Here, a dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm is proposed to overcome desolvation barriers for enhanced ultralow&#8208;temperature energy storage. Following this new paradigm, a weakly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolyte (WDIE) is developed by regulating dipole&#8211;dipole interactions within ionic solvates between primary and co&#8208;solvents. Through comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical analyses, the interplay between dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and solvation dynamics across both interfacial and bulk phases is elucidated. Specifically, WDIE transforms the ionic solvate from conventional double&#8208;layer to distinctive mono&#8208;layer with attenuated solvent coordination number, effectively lowering solvent residence time and desolvation energy barriers. Simultaneously, it promotes solvent cluster dissociation, disrupting cross&#8208;linked electrolyte networks and enhancing bulk ion diffusion. As a proof of concept, WDIE&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit optimized ultralow temperature performance, which retain 97.15% capacity from 20 to &#8722;70 &#176;C, surpassing moderately&#8208; and strongly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolytes and ranking among the best reported. Moreover, theoretical calculations further demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy when ionic radius exceeds 3.84 &#197;. This work demonstrates a scalable dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm to overcome low&#8208;temperature EES limitations.

         <title>Fully Reshapeable and Recyclable Protein Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the substantial stiffness contrast between protein hydrogels in their folded and unfolded protein states as well as reversible disulfide crosslinking, a robust and general strategy is reported to engineer fully reshapeable and recyclable protein hydrogels. These protein hydrogels can be reversibly reshaped across one&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;dimensional geometries, and be fully recycled for material circularity.








Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as a new generation of functional materials with a broad range of applications in diverse fields. They usually cannot be reshaped or recycled, restricting their ability to respond to evolving demands and emerging applications, and contributing to the accumulation of synthetic polymer waste and associated environmental concerns.

&lt;p&gt;By taking advantage of the substantial stiffness contrast between protein hydrogels in their folded and unfolded protein states as well as reversible disulfide crosslinking, a robust and general strategy is reported to engineer fully reshapeable and recyclable protein hydrogels. These protein hydrogels can be reversibly reshaped across one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometries, and be fully recycled for material circularity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels have emerged as a new generation of functional materials with a broad range of applications in diverse fields. They usually cannot be reshaped or recycled, restricting their ability to respond to evolving demands and emerging applications, and contributing to the accumulation of synthetic polymer waste and associated environmental concerns. Here, a robust and general strategy is reported to engineer fully reshapeable and recyclable protein hydrogels by integrating protein folding-unfolding with reversible disulfide crosslinking. Taking advantage of the substantial stiffness contrast between protein hydrogels in their folded and unfolded protein states, protein hydrogels are reversibly reshaped across one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometries. Due to the denaturant concentration dependency and reversibility of the protein folding-unfolding process, the resulting reshaping is highly tunable, reproducible, and chemically erasable, enabling consecutive shape transformations from a single hydrogel precursor. To impart full recyclability, irreversible crosslinking chemistry is replaced with a dynamic disulfide-based one. The resulting hydrogels can be fully recycled, and the recovered proteins can be reused to form new hydrogels, allowing for complete recycling and repeated remolding of hydrogels into new shapes without compromising their mechanical properties. This approach establishes a robust platform for developing next-generation protein-based materials with dynamic formability and true material circularity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first electrically&#8208;driven 2D semiconductor microcavity laser is achieved at room temperature under AC voltage driving conditions.

Abstract
2D monolayered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for realizing ultracompact, low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers. And the development of the electrical&#8208;driven TMDC devices is crucial for enhancing the integration potential of practical optoelectronic systems. However, at the current stage, the electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser has never been realized. Herein, the first electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC microcavity laser have been developed. In this device, an alternating current (AC) generates electroluminescence lasing in suspended monolayered WSe2 integrated on a microdisk cavity. The input&#8211;output curve, bandwidth narrowing, and second&#8208;order coherence is analyzed to confirm the lasing characteristics at room temperature. The realization of the room&#8208;temperature AC&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser establishes a new area of research on electrically pumped compact lasers and is likely to assist with the implementation of diverse TMDC&#8208;based practical photonic devices in the future.

         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Electronic Effect and D&#8208;Band Center Bi&#8208;Modulated Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Enzyme Enables All&#8208;Stage Infected Wound Healing</title>

Push&#8208;pull electronic effect and d&#8208;band center bi&#8208;modulated bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme is proposed, which is consisted of FeMoS4 and MXene. Under NIR irradiation, the heterostructure facilitates electron&#8208;hole separation with localized electron accumulation at FeMoS4 sites. The electronic push&#8208;pull effect induced by Mo polarizes oxygen&#8208;containing reactants toward Fe active centers, enabling sequential electron capture for ROS generation. It provides an efficient approach in infected wound healing.








Abstract
Pathogenic infections pose a persistent threat to global public health, necessitating innovative antibacterial strategies with well&#8208;defined disinfection pathway. The antibacterial efficiency is confined in the contradiction between reactants adsorption and intermediates desorption. Here, the FeMoS4/MXene bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (FM BioHJzyme) is proposed and constructed. Under the inspiration of near&#8208;infrared light (NIR), the heterostructures between the FeMoS4 and MXene facilitates efficient electron&#8208;hole separation with localized electron accumulation at FeMoS4 sites. Crucially, the electronic push&#8208;pull effect induced by Mo polarizes oxygen&#8208;containing reactants (H2O2, H2O, O2) toward Fe active centers, enabling sequential electron capture for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The results also reveal an enhancement in electron density at Fe sites compared to FeS/MXene controls, which is accompanied by a downshift in the Fe d&#8208;band center that reduces intermediates adsorption energy. The therapeutic efficacy is systematically evaluated using an S. aureus&#8208;infected full&#8208;thickness skin defect model. The bi&#8208;modulated FM BioHJzyme exhibits favorable antibacterial efficiency under NIR irradiation, while subsequent wound healing is facilitated through collagen deposition and angiogenesis in the following absence of NIR irradiation. This work offers a deep insight into the intricate mechanism&#8208;performance relationship of BioHJzyme platform in catalytic anti&#8208;bacterial application and proposes a sustainable approach of mechanism&#8208;guided materials design.

         <title>Microenvironment Regulation Unlocks High Li&#8314; Conduction in Polyether Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Through introducing Ge4+ sites with weak Lewis acidity during in situ polymerization process, a microenvironment&#8208;regulated polyether electrolyte (MPPE) is successfully developed with high Li+ conductivity for high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The achieved MPPE possesses weakened Li+&#8722;polymer interaction, increased free&#8208;Li+ concentration, and introduced direct Li+ transport pathway, thereby collectively enabling significantly promoted Li+ conduction.








Abstract
Polyether electrolytes (PEs) have attracted significant research and industrial interest for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, traditional PEs are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion (Li+) conductivity primary due to strong Li&#8314;&#8211;polymer interactions (i.e. Li+&#8208;oxygen coordination). Current approaches of modifying polymer molecular structures are largely challenged by the inherent molecular structural constraints of specific polymers and the complexity of the required structural engineering processes. Herein, a novel and straightforward strategy i proposed to reduce the Li+&#8722;polymer interaction, increase free&#8208;Li+ concentration, and introduce ion&#8208;channels by regulating the microenvironment of PEs through introducing Ge4+ sites with weak Lewis acidity during in situ polymerization. In this way, the microenvironment regulates PE with a high ionic conductivity of 1.83 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C and a Li+ transference number of 0.8 is achieved. Remarkably, the electrolyte exhibits extraordinary cycling stability in Li||Li symmetric cells for over 2000 h, demonstrating dendrite&#8208;free Li metal deposition during prolonged cycling. Moreover, the assembled Li||LiFePO4 cells achieve an impressive capacity retention of 92.1% and &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency after a long&#8208;term stability of 2190 cycles at 5&#160;C. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;performance LMBs through microenvironment regulation.

         <title>Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Triggered Mass Transfer Gating in Covalent Organic Framework for Hydrogen Peroxide Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;triggered mass transfer gating (MTG) strategy reconfigures interfacial reactions for photocatalytic H2O2 generation in COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Mechanistic studies elucidate the ternary role of sacrificial agents as MTG regulators, effectively addressing inherent reaction constraints.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts for H2O2 production remain challenging by mass transport limitations and poor charge separation efficiency. Herein, a sacrificial agent&#8208;triggered mass&#8208;transfer gating (MTG) strategy is developed to reconfigure interfacial reaction for photocatalytic H2O2 generation via synthesized benzothiazole&#8208;COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Notably, benzyl alcohol (BA) enhances the mass transport and the catalytic site accessibility, scavenges photogenerated holes, and supplies protons for coupling reactions, thereby increasing the H2O2 yield of Tp&#8208;BTz COF to 100.9 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving the outstanding photocatalytic performance reported to date. Both Tp&#8208;BTz COF and Tp&#8208;TTz COF demonstrate durably high H2O2 production efficiency even in the high&#8208;salinity seawater and municipal tap water systems. The generated H2O2 effectively degrades organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB), demonstrating practical potential for wastewater treatment. The proposed gating strategy by introducing BA enables three synergistic functions: i) modulating interfacial reactions, ii) acting as a sacrificial agent to scavenge holes, and iii) supplying abundant protons (H+) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to facilitate the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This approach establishes a generalizable paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems toward sustainable energy and environmental applications.

&lt;p&gt;A sacrificial-agent-triggered mass transfer gating (MTG) strategy reconfigures interfacial reactions for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation in COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface-confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion-dominated redox processes. Mechanistic studies elucidate the ternary role of sacrificial agents as MTG regulators, effectively addressing inherent reaction constraints.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production remain challenging by mass transport limitations and poor charge separation efficiency. Herein, a sacrificial agent-triggered mass-transfer gating (MTG) strategy is developed to reconfigure interfacial reaction for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation via synthesized benzothiazole-COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface-confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion-dominated redox processes. Notably, benzyl alcohol (BA) enhances the mass transport and the catalytic site accessibility, scavenges photogenerated holes, and supplies protons for coupling reactions, thereby increasing the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of Tp-BTz COF to 100.9 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieving the outstanding photocatalytic performance reported to date. Both Tp-BTz COF and Tp-TTz COF demonstrate durably high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency even in the high-salinity seawater and municipal tap water systems. The generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively degrades organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB), demonstrating practical potential for wastewater treatment. The proposed gating strategy by introducing BA enables three synergistic functions: i) modulating interfacial reactions, ii) acting as a sacrificial agent to scavenge holes, and iii) supplying abundant protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to facilitate the proton-coupled electron transfer. This approach establishes a generalizable paradigm for designing high-performance photocatalytic systems toward sustainable energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallization Modulation Through Electron Transport Layer Surface Reconstruction Enables High&#8208;Performance Full&#8208;Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A homogenization strategy for SnO2 ETL based on surface reconstruction is developed by introducing natural molecule L&#8208;carnosine (LC) at the buried interface. LC not only achieves more homogeneous photon and electron transport, but also manipulates crystallization dynamics. The optimized device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.30%, which is among the highest values reported for air&#8208;processed n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.








Abstract
The quality of the buried interface critically determines the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a homogenization strategy for the tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) based on surface reconstruction is developed to enable mesoscale interface manipulation. By introducing the natural L&#8208;carnosine (LC) at the buried interface, we achieve homogenized photon and electron transport through surface optimization of the SnO2 ETL. Additionally, the multi&#8208;active sites in LC establish interlayer bridging and optimize interfacial contact, simultaneously passivating interfacial defects, mitigating residual stress, and improving carrier dynamics. Furthermore, LC modification regulates perovskite crystallization kinetics through multiple bonding mechanisms, facilitating the growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Ultimately, the champion device fabricated entirely in air achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.30%, one of the highest efficiencies reported for air&#8208;processed n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits enhanced stability under ISOS protocols, retaining 91.03% of its initial efficiency after 3192 h at 30 &#177; 5% relative humidity, 90.71% after 1512 h of thermal aging at 65&#160;&#176;C, and 90.17% after 1000 h of continuous maximum power point tracking under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Stabilizing Grain Boundaries by In Situ Formation of Robust Layered Metallo&#8208;Organic Complex toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual PbI2 was made to form stable metal&#8208;organic complexes at the grain boundaries by 2&#8208;iodoimidazole (2&#8208;IM). The inverted 1.66 eV PSCs achieved a PCE of 24.12%. This strategy has good universality and achieved an efficient 1.53 eV PSCs with a PCE of 26.84%. Inverted wide bandgap PSCs maintained 94% of their initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000 hours at the maximum power point.








Abstract
The grain boundaries (GBs) instability induced by photodecomposition of residual PbI2 is long&#8208;standing challenge for further simultaneous improvement of stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel GB stabilization strategy through managing unstable residual PbI2 within perovskite films is reported, which is realized by incorporating 2&#8208;iodoimidazole (2&#8208;IM) into perovskite precursor solution. The 2&#8208;IM can in situ convert unstable residual PbI2 at GBs into robust metallo&#8208;organic complex 2&#8208;IMPbI2 exhibiting an orderly hexagonal layered crystal structure. 2&#8208;IMPbI2 is uncovered to have much better defect passivation effect and stability than PbI2. The formed 2&#8208;IMPbI2 facilitates perovskite crystallization, passivates GB defect, suppresses ion migration, mitigates phase segregation, and promotes carrier transport, contributing to simultaneously enhanced PCE and stability. Owing to the ingenious GB modulation strategy, the inverted 1.66&#160;eV PSCs achieve a PCE of 24.12%, which is among the highest PCEs ever reported for 1.66&#160;eV PSCs. This strategy demonstrates good universality by accomplishing efficient 1.53&#160;eV PSCs with a PCE of 26.84%. Moreover, the inverted wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs with 2&#8208;IMPbI2 maintain 94% and 90% of their initial efficiencies after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation and after 500&#160;h of thermal stress at 85&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Photothermal Conversion in Non&#8208;Fluorescent Diradicaloid Organic Molecules for Efficient Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a strategy to achieve near&#8208;quantitative photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.3% in organic molecules by incorporating electron&#8208;donating substituents in non&#8208;fluorescent diradicaloid. These molecules exhibit broadband absorption across 300&#8211;2000&#160;nm, and can be elevated to 103&#160;&#176;C under one sun irradiation when loaded into polyurethane, enabling a high solar water evaporation efficiency of 98.52%.








Abstract
Organic small molecules have emerged as promising photothermal materials for solar energy harvesting due to their structural tunability and diverse optoelectronic properties. However, achieving photothermal conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 90% in such systems remains a significant challenge, largely limited by residual fluorescence and suboptimal non&#8208;radiative decay pathways. Here, a molecular design strategy is reported that combines inherently non&#8208;fluorescent diradicaloid cores with electron&#8208;donating substituents to facilitate non&#8208;radiative decay and enhance PCE. It is demonstrated that the PCE can be effectively tuned from 64.9% (nitro&#8208;substituted) to a near&#8208;quantitative 94.3% (dimethylamine&#8208;substituted). Moreover, the equilibrium temperature of dimethylamine functionalized diradicaloid can be elevated to record breaking 350&#160;&#176;C in organic materials under 1&#160;W cm&#8722;2 808&#160;nm laser, and lifted to 103&#160;&#176;C under one sun irradiation when loaded into polyurethane. This exceptional performance is attributed to a small energy gap, strong donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and active molecular motion that together promote efficient vibronic relaxation and internal conversion. Furthermore, these molecules exhibit broadband absorption across 300&#8211;2000&#160;nm, enabling a high water evaporation efficiency of 98.52% under one sun and facilitating high&#8208;voltage output in solar thermoelectric generators. This work presents a robust design strategy for high&#8208;efficiency organic photothermal materials, offering new opportunities for solar&#8208;driven thermal energy harvesting and conversion technologies.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Driven Nanoarchitectonics for Smart Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 42, October 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven nanoarchitectonics framework for targeted drug delivery, combining database&#8208;guided nanocarrier design, machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted surface engineering with a designed targeting system, and in silico modeling for dynamic optimization. This integrated strategy enables the development of programmable, responsive, and adaptive delivery systems, offering a transformative approach to overcoming translational barriers in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
The development of data&#8208;driven and targeted drug delivery systems is essential for advancing precision therapeutics. Despite substantial progress in nanocarrier development, conventional platforms continue to face major challenges in clinical translation due to biological complexity, off&#8208;target accumulation, and limited adaptability to dynamic physiological environments. The integration of nanoarchitectonics and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an advanced strategy for engineering delivery systems that are structurally programmable, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and autonomously optimized.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nanoarchitectonics framework for targeted drug delivery, combining database-guided nanocarrier design, machine learning (ML)-assisted surface engineering with a designed targeting system, and in silico modeling for dynamic optimization. This integrated strategy enables the development of programmable, responsive, and adaptive delivery systems, offering a transformative approach to overcoming translational barriers in precision nanomedicine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of data-driven and targeted drug delivery systems is essential for advancing precision therapeutics. Despite substantial progress in nanocarrier development, conventional platforms continue to face major challenges in clinical translation due to biological complexity, off-target accumulation, and limited adaptability to dynamic physiological environments. The integration of nanoarchitectonics and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an advanced strategy for engineering delivery systems that are structurally programmable, stimuli-responsive, and autonomously optimized. Nanoarchitectonics enables the construction of hierarchical nanostructures with precise spatial and temporal control, while AI facilitates modeling, prediction, and iterative optimization throughout the development pipeline. In this perspective, an AI-driven nanoarchitectonics framework is introduced for targeted drug delivery, structured around three key phases: 1) molecular target identification through bioinformatic profiling, 2) machine learning (ML)-guided surface engineering to enhance targeting specificity, and 3) in silico modeling of delivery dynamics and systemic distribution. Drawing on recent advances and representative case studies, how AI tools are illustrated, from generative design algorithms to predictive pharmacokinetic models, are transforming the field from empirical formulation toward mechanism-informed and AI-driven intelligent design. By highlighting current limitations and outlining future directions for the integration of AI and nanoarchitectonics, are concluded with a focus on enabling clinically translatable nanomedicine platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exploring Neurotransmitter Dynamics
Optical investigation of molecular dynamics occurring within the biomimetic human biosensor system, especially under water environment, has been regarded as a challenging area of study. Based on the great advantage of spectral capabilities of terahertz spectroscopic tools, a unique biosensing platform has been proposed assisted by nanodisc&#8208;hybridized nanoscale metasurfaces. The sensing capability was determined to enable the receptor&#8208;ligand interactions occurring at optical hotspots, where the terahertz field was strongly localized and greatly enhanced, and controlled by targeting specific frequency of the metasurface. More details can be found in article number 2504858 by Hyun Seok Song, Minah Seo, and co&#8208;workers.

Triboelectric Nanogenerators
This illustration highlights polyelectrolyte&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators that achieve tunable tribopolarity and enhanced environmental stability through covalently fixed ionic groups. Systematic variation of polycation and polyanion compositions with different cations and anions enables consistent ion redistribution and predictable polarity shifts along the triboelectric series. This strategy provides a versatile and modular platform for stable energy&#8208;harvesting devices under heat and humidity. More details can be found in article number 2505547 by Ju&#8208;Hyuck Lee, Wonho Lee, and co&#8208;workers.

Morphing Matter Soft Robot
This cover illustrates a morphing matter soft robot controlled by remote electric fields. The robot is made of an elastomeric composite with nano paracrystalline carbon. When exposed to a nonuniform electric field, dielectrophoretic forces causes the robot to locomote, bend, stretch, and twist. Simultaneously, charge concentrations at the ends of the robot result in like&#8208;charge repulsion and finger&#8208;like protrusions. Soft morphing matter exhibits attractive remote&#8208;control morphogenetic actuation for next&#8208;generation soft robots. More details can be found in article number 2419077 by Ciqun Xu, Charl Faul, Majid Taghavi, and Jonathan Rossiter.

Heterojunction&#8208;Driven Stochasticity
In article number 2505150, Hocheon Yoo and co&#8208;workers present a bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance transistor, which amplifies intrinsic noise and entropy throughput. This enables the generation of multi&#8208;bit true random numbers from amplified intrinsic noise, which are then used as latent vectors to drive high&#8208;fidelity image synthesis.

The fascinating properties of LCEs demonstrate outstanding potential in biomimetic soft robots. From the novel perspective of integrated material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, this paper systematically reviewed the latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators, including plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. The potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed.








Abstract
After 30 years of development, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) biomimetic soft robots have been engineered to possess the capability to mimic and surpass the locomotion of soft organisms. However, most of the current reviews on LCEs are focused on their material/alignment design, fabrication technologies, actuation mechanisms, and applications. The latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators is systematically reviewed here from a novel perspective of material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, which includes plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. In addition, the potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed, where further in&#8208;depth research is required. Directions and valuable insights are provided for subsequent research efforts. This paper offers an inspiring and critical overview of the significant progress in the field of smart biomimetic LCE soft robotics and provides an available guide for researchers who are considering entering the exciting domain of LCE soft actuators.

         <title>Beyond Presumptions: Toward Mechanistic Clarity in Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Catalysts for Electrochemical H2O2 Production via Data Science</title>

Metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts enable the sustainable synthesis of hydrogen peroxide via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction; however, active site complexity continues to hinder reliable interpretation. This review critiques correlation&#8208;based approaches and highlights the importance of orthogonal experimental designs, standardized catalyst passports, multivariate statistics, and explainable machine learning integrated with operando spectroscopy to identify accurate catalytic descriptors for rational catalyst development.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, featuring tunable structures, readily available precursors, and excellent stability, have garnered significant attention for sustainable H2O2 production. However, despite extensive investigations, the precise mechanisms underlying catalytic selectivity on these carbon materials remain unclear and highly debated. Previous mechanistic interpretations frequently attribute catalytic activity to specific oxygen functional groups or heteroatom dopants through correlation&#8208;driven hypotheses and simplified theoretical models. Such approaches often overlook the intrinsic complexity of carbon surfaces, where multiple variables, including dopant types, defect structures, surface groups, and hybridization states, coexist and interact simultaneously, leading to contradictory conclusions. This review critically examines&#160;the limitations of these traditional approaches and emphasize the need of systematic experimental designs that independently vary structural parameters, along with advanced analytical methods capable of resolving active&#8208;site ambiguity, are critically reviewed. Recent developments employing orthogonal material libraries, rigorous experimental controls, catalyst passport metadata, and advanced multivariate and meta&#8208;analytical tools have emerged as robust frameworks for bias&#8208;resistant catalyst design. Integrating explainable and generative machine learning models with operando spectroscopy provides a robust, end&#8208;to&#8208;end approach for identifying and validating accurate catalytic descriptors.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of soft thermal actuators, focusing on their heating mechanisms, material innovations, structural designs, and emerging applications. Heat generation mechanisms including Joule heating, electromagnetic induction, and electromagnetic radiation and heat transfer mechanisms such as fluid convection are discussed. Advances in materials are grouped into two areas: heating materials, primarily based on nanomaterials, and thermally responsive materials including hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers, and shape&#8208;memory polymers. Structural designs, such as extension, bending, twisting, and 3D deformable configurations, are explored for enabling complex and precise movements. Applications of soft thermal actuators span environmental exploration, gripping and manipulation, biomedical devices for rehabilitation and surgery, and interactive systems for virtual/augmented reality and therapy. The review concludes with an outlook on challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for further improvement in speed, energy efficiency, and intelligent soft robotic systems. By bridging fundamental principles with cutting&#8208;edge applications, this review aims to inspire further advancements in the field of thermally actuated soft robotics.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Alicyclic Dipolar Glass Dielectric Polymer Capacitors for Superior High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address multiple material paradoxes (Eg&#8208;Tg, &#603;r&#8208;Eg, self&#8208;healing&#8208;Tg), semi&#8208;alicyclic dipolar glass polymers (sAl&#8208;DG) is designed with alternating non&#8208;conjugated alicyclic and dipolar aromatic units. The alicyclic unit provides large bandgap and self&#8208;healing, while the dipolar unit offers high polarization and thermal stability. sAl&#8208;DG achieves an excellent discharge energy density with 90% efficiency U&#951;90 &#8776; 3.94 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;power&#8208;density metallized film capacitors at elevated temperatures and electric field extremes are key components in electrical and electronic systems. The miniaturization, integration, and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the systems demand high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, high&#8208;efficiency, and reliable dielectrics. A major challenge is to concurrently break multiple paradoxes of bandgap (Eg) with glass transition temperature (Tg), dielectric constant (&#603;r) with Eg, and self&#8208;healing capability with Tg. In this contribution, a class of semi&#8208;alicyclic dipolar glass dielectric polymers (sAl&#8208;DG) is developed, with an alternating non&#8208;conjugated alicyclic unit and a strong dipolar group aromatic unit. The alicyclic unit synergistically confers a large Eg and the potential for strong self&#8208;healing while the other unit concurrently endows high polarization and thermal stability, effectively decoupling the multiple paradoxes. As a result, sAl&#8208;DG delivers large Eg with 3.99&#8211;4.26 eV, high Tg with 218&#8211;387 &#176;C, high &#603;r with 3.39&#8211;3.71 (200&#176;C, 1 kHz) and simultaneously excellent self&#8208;healing ability with self&#8208;healing energy of 15.03 mJ. Hence, this molecular decoupling strategy enables a superior discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency (U&#951;90) of up to 6.2 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3.94 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C. Plus, a stacked sAl&#8208;DG capacitor demonstrates 1.06 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 94% efficiency under 250 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#176;C, showcasing operational viability.

         <title>Sequential DNA Coding for Programmable Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel programmable encryption strategy with controllable DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin&#8208;mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the dynamic generation of DNA sequences and the secure recording of information with user&#8208;specific access. This approach enhances data security, positioning DNA as a high&#8208;performance material to meet future confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands.









Abstract
DNA molecules, with highly variable sequences and inherent programmability, emerge as a promising material for next&#8208;generation information storage and data encryption. However, due to the singular encryption method or limited randomness of the secret key, current encryptions remain vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks and the need for enhanced information security persists. This study introduces a programmable encryption strategy based on long&#8208;chain DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin&#8208;mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the generation of DNA keys and the recording of encoded information. Ultimately, encrypted text and image data can be decoded and retrieved through sequencing with customized access based on user permissions. This approach positions DNA as a high&#8208;performance information material and establishes a programmable encryption framework, offering strong potential to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands of future information security systems.

         <title>Vascularized and Perfusable Human Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Model Recapitulates Aspects of Myocardial Ischemia and Enables Analysis of Nanomedicine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel 3D human ischemic heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip, with perfusable vasculature directly interfaced with myocardial tissue, replicates key aspects of ischemic heart injury. It also demonstrates the targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy of cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes, validating the platform for drug and nanomedicine screening in myocardial ischemia.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of CVDs are not yet fully understood, and animal models do not accurately replicate human heart function. Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technologies with increasing complexity are being developed to mimic aspects of native human cardiac physiology for mechanistic studies and as screening platforms for drugs and nanomedicines. Here, a 3D human myocardial ischemia&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform incorporating perfusable vasculature in direct contact with myocardial regions is designed. Infusing a vasoconstrictor cocktail, including angiotensin II and phenylephrine, into this heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip model leads to increased arrhythmias in cardiomyocyte pacing, fibroblast activation, and damage to blood vessels, all of which are hallmarks of ischemic heart injury. To verify the potential of this platform for drug and nanocarrier screening, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is conducted with cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes containing Alamandine. This nanomedicine formulation enhances targeting to the ischemia model, alleviates myocardial ischemia&#8208;related characteristics, and improves cardiomyocyte beating. This confirms that the vascularized chip model of human myocardial ischemia provides both functional and mechanistic insights into myocardial tissue pathophysiology and can contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling medicines.

         <title>Electric Field Driven Soft Morphing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents soft morphing matter robots that exhibit extremely high morphological adaptability and complex multimodal electric field response. They can undergo large, controlled body deformation and show complex locomotion on different terrains under the manipulation of external electric fields, making a significant step beyond current electroactive and soft robots.








Abstract
The manipulation of soft morphing robots using external electric fields and wireless control is challenging. Electric field&#8208;driven soft morphing matter, termed electro&#8208;morphing gel (e&#8208;MG), that exhibits complex multimodal large&#8208;scale deformation (showing up to 286% strain, and strain rates up to 500%&#160;s&#8722;1) and locomotion under external electric fields applied using compact and lightweight electrodes is presented. The distinctive capabilities of e&#8208;MG derive from the combination of an elastomeric matrix and nanoparticulate paracrystalline carbon. The material properties, electroactive principle, and control strategies are explored and demonstrate fundamental morphing matter behaviors including rotating, translating, stretching, spreading, bending, and twisting. A range of potential bio&#8208;inspired applications, including slim mold&#8208;like spreading, snail&#8208;like jumping over a gap, object transport, wall climbing, and a frog tongue&#8208;inspired gripper is shown. The e&#8208;MG provides morphing capabilities beyond the current limitations in wireless control for a wide range of applications in soft and bio&#8208;inspired robotics, dexterous manipulation, and space exploration.

         <title>Thiophene Expanded Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer as Hole Transport Layer for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 20.78%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed two thiophene expanded self&#8208;assembled monolayers, which shows better structural order that helps to enlarge the dipole moment, improve the hole extraction ability, and suppress the charge recombination, thus yielded an impressive efficiency of 20.78% for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transport layers (HTLs) have achieved groundbreaking progress of device efficiency in perovskite and organic photovoltaics. Expanding the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of carbazole is an effective approach to enhance the molecular dipole moment and facilitate charge extraction of SAMs. However, this strategy tends to cause poor solubility and excessive self&#8208;aggregation of SAMs. In this work, two highly efficient SAMs are developed by substituting a non&#8208;fused thiophene unit on 3,6&#8208;position of carbazole, namely (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonate (2PAThCz) and diethyl (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonate (4PAThCz). The introduction of thiophene can completely alter the molecular packing behavior of SAM, promoting more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and increasing dipole moment, which enhances hole transport. Furthermore, the long spacer length on 4PAThCz enable to help it achieves excellent solubility, inhibit self&#8208;aggregation, and strengthen the molecular orderliness. As a result, an impressive efficiency of 20.78% (certified as 20.45%) is achieved for single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Toughened 2D Moir&#233; Superlattice Membranes with Extreme Thermal Shock Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D moir&#233; superlattice composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) demonstrates exceptional fracture toughness, primarily attributed to hBN's crack deflection and bifurcation mechanisms. Notably, this robust membrane withstands 200 extreme thermal shock cycles up to 1800 K at a heating rate of 10&#8308; K s&#8315;&#185;. Such remarkable thermal stability facilitates the successful synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles.








Abstract
Excellent mechanical strength and toughness are demanded for two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) membranes in various applications to withstand extreme strain and temperature changes and resist crack propagation. However, the trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness poses significant challenges in meeting these requirements. This study presents a self&#8208;toughened 2D moir&#233; superlattice membrane composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) that exhibits high mechanical strength. The intrinsic toughness originates from the high energy release rate associated with the crack deflection and bifurcation in hBN. Remarkably, this robust membrane endures 200 cycles of thermal shock up to 1800 K with 104 K s&#8722;1 heating rate, during which high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) are successfully synthesized. The findings pave the way for the design and fabrication of robust 2D superlattices, facilitating future exploration under extreme conditions.

         <title>Activating Ferroelectric&#8208;Magnetic Synergistic Effects at Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces Toward Superfast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve high energy density and fast&#8208;charging capability in layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, a surface modification strategy is employed to enable ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, this work unveils the optimization mechanism by which such synergistic effects enhance the electrochemical performance of layered cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxides are promising cathode candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density. However, the rate and cycling performances are hindered by severe interfacial side reactions and sluggish kinetics. Using NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (NM) as a model material, ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects are activated at the NM&#8208;electrolyte interfaces via constructing a multiferroic layer on the NM surface, significantly realizing the superfast and stable sodium storage. First, the nucleation and growth of interfacial layers are regulated by ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects, resulting in the formation of a thin interfacial layer enriched with NaF. Second, a uniform sodium&#8208;ion distribution at the NM&#8208;electrolyte interfaces is established, boosting the charge transfer kinetics. Third, the distortion of NiO6 local structure is reduced, minimizing the structural change and improving the cycling stability. As a result, superior cycling (82.1% retention after 1000 cycles) and rate capabilities (up to 50&#8211;100C) in half cells, as well as high energy densities (340.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and fast&#8208;charging properties (&#8776;113 s per charge with &#8776;240.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 input) in full cells, are achieved. This work presents a novel strategy for improving rate and cycling capabilities by harnessing ferroelectric&#8208;magnetic synergistic effects, offering a pathway for designing advanced electrodes in secondary batteries.

         <title>Programming Defects and Cavities into Colloidal Crystals Engineered With DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seed&#8208;mediated crystallization is adapted for colloidal crystals to design cavities and defect architectures through chemically programmed DNA sequences and appropriate seed particle geometry. This synthetic approach combines tenets from both atomic and colloidal crystallization to deliberately control defect formation in superlattices and enables the design of functional materials with unusual and tailorable properties.








Abstract
Taking inspiration from seed&#8208;mediated crystal growth in atomic and molecular systems, a strategy is developed for incorporating particle and volume defects into the interior of colloidal crystals consisting of programmable atom equivalents (PAEs, oligonucleotide&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles) assembled with DNA. Discrete PAEs spanning a range of shapes, sizes, and compositions serve as nucleation sites for seed&#8208;mediated colloidal crystal growth and are incorporated into the centers of colloidal crystal lattices as cavities. Importantly, seed PAE shapes or sizes that are geometrically mismatched with the colloidal crystal lattice symmetry introduce defects such as local lattice disorder and long&#8208;range grain boundaries that arise through geometric frustration. Colloidal crystals synthesized with plasmonic seed particles exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelength scattering cross&#8208;sections that are highly dependent upon cavity/particle size and shape. Taken together, these findings establish a platform for the deliberate introduction of 2 and 3D defects into colloidal crystals, which may inform the design of structures and materials for thermal management, sensing, and catalysis.

         <title>Dual Optimization of Electrolyte and Interface in Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 via Ga3+ Doping for Advanced Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study incorporates Ga3+ into Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3, effectively suppressing the formation of the low&#8208;conductivity &#946;&#8242; phase and significantly reducing stacking faults in the sintered samples, while also enhancing the wettability between the electrolyte and sodium metal. The in situ formed Na&#8208;Ga alloy interface further strengthens the stability of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact.








Abstract
Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 is a highly promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (SSSBs) with a wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability against metallic sodium. However, its practical application is hindered by the instability of &#946;&#8243; phase (R3&#175;$\bar 3$m) during sintering, low polycrystalline ionic conductivity at room temperature, and poor interfacial contact with sodium anodes. In this study, a stablized SSSB is obtained via doping Ga3+ into Na1.67Mg0.67Al10.33O17 (NMAO), which also suppresses the formation of the &#946;&#8242; phase (P63/mmc) and decreases stacking faults. After sintering at 1550 &#176;C for 2 h, Na1.67Mg0.67Al9.33GaO17 (NMA9.33GO) exhibits an ionic conductivity of 9.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, &#8776;1.7 times greater than NMAO. Furthermore, Ga3+ doping enhances the wettability with sodium, achieving superior contact stability and the formation of Na&#8208;Ga alloys at the interface significantly improves electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact stability, achieving a high critical current density (CCD) of 0.8 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low interfacial impedance of 16 &#937; cm2. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a high discharge capacity of 91 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C, and maintaining 87% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work provides new insights into improving electrolyte performance and interfacial engineering through doping strategies, thereby promoting the development of efficient and long&#8208;term SSSBs.

         <title>Deterministic Memristive Polarization Switching in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work emphasizes the achievement of deterministic multilevel polarization in rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through crystallographically &#8208; guided domain engineering, precisely controlling domain switching, overcoming the bistable limitations of traditional ferroelectrics, and providing an innovative strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The burgeoning field of neuromorphic computing demands ferroelectric materials exhibiting memristive multilevel polarization to enable high&#8208;density memory storage and brain&#8208;inspired devices. Here, it is demonstrated deterministic multilevel polarization in a relaxor ferroelectric&#8208;rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through domain engineering, achieving precise control over stepwise domain switching. Using reciprocal space mapping (RSM) and in situ second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), it is shown that optimized electric pulses guide multi&#8208;domain switching to a 4R engineered domain state, stabilizing memristive behavior. In situ characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy, reveal that the memristive behavior arises from local domain rearrangements rather than crystal structure transitions. The resulting multilevel polarization states with up to 20 levels exhibit robust retention (&gt;104 s) and fatigue resistance (&gt;105 cycles) while maintaining high polarizability. Phase&#8208;field simulations corroborate these findings, offering microscopic insights into the repeatability of multilevel polarization. This approach overcomes the bistable limitations of conventional ferroelectrics, enabling stable multilevel polarization states that modulate mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. This results provide a versatile strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors, advancing neuromorphic and reconfigurable computing with minimal compromise in ferroelectric performance.

         <title>A Scalable Fishbone Nanowire Array (FINE) for 3D Quasi&#8208;Intracellular Recording in Intact Brains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles on the sides of an implantable shank records 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.








Abstract
Intracellular recordings provide unique access to the submillisecond neuronal membrane potential changes, revealing dynamics that orchestrate cellular, local, and large&#8208;scale brain activity. However, technical requirements limit the scalability of intracellular recordings to large populations of neurons, especially within intact brains. To overcome this limitation, a Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) is developed with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles along an implantable shank to record 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. A novel fabrication process is developed to integrate reverse&#8208;angled platinum silicide (PtSi) nanowires to preserve the structural integrity of FINE during insertion. As&#8208;implanted or sub&#8208;micron retraced FINE spreads the PtSi nanowires away from the shank to establish intimate nanowire&#8208;neuron interfaces that yield quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials. Comparative analyses of nanowire recordings versus adjacent planar recordings on the same shank validate their distinctive quasi&#8208;intracellular recording characteristics. The scalability of FINE is demonstrated to a 3D 24&#8208;shank array with 594 nanowires and 430 planar contacts and successfully identified quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials across 127 distinct nanowires in the intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations and patterns of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.

         <title>Vacancy Functionalized MoS2 Nanolaminated Membranes for Efficient Sieving in Forward Osmosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur vacancy functionalization strategy is proposed for fabricating high performance nanolaminate membranes by grafting three kinds of thiol (S&#8208;H) containing molecules (Cysteine, 3&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol, 1&#8208;Propanethiol) on MoS2 nanosheets, in which propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits best salt rejection (99.3%) and water/salt selectivity (800 bar&#8722;1) in forward osmosis.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based nanolaminates are promising candidates for water purification. However, fabricating nanochannels with tunable capillary widths remain a challenge. This study proposed a sulfur vacancy functionalization strategy for fabricating high performance nanolaminate membranes by grafting three kinds of thiol (S&#8208;H) containing molecules (Cysteine, 3&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol, 1&#8208;Propanethiol) on MoS2 nanosheets, in which propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibited best salt rejection (99.3%) and water/salt selectivity (800&#160;bar&#8722;1) in forward osmosis (draw solution: sucrose solution). It is found the capillary width increased from 0.2 &#197; in pristine MoS2 to &#8776;5 &#197; in propanethiol functionalized MoS2 membranes. Numerical simulations suggest that nanofluidic properties of the functionalized membranes are governed by the fundamental interaction between water and the corresponding S&#8208;H functional group, and the interlayer distance. Importantly, since the S&#8208;H containing molecules can repair MoS2 nanosheets by fitting into the sulfur vacancies, the stability of the membranes is also improved with minimal swelling, which is promising for their practical applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Selective Terahertz&#8208;Nanodisc Metasurfaces for Exploring Neurotransmitter Dynamics beyond Spectral Limitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Observation and detection of neurotransmitter dynamics in aqueous system has been hurdle for analytical fields due to its weak and reversible nature. A terahertz&#8208;nanodisc metasurface which implements comprehensive detection over conformational change and selective sensing is introduced. Utilizing the THz regime photonics and biomimetic environment with nanodisc, the proposed biosensing platform provides comprehensive insight over receptor&#8208;ligand dynamics and molecular sensing.








Abstract
The rapid growth of nanotechnology and spectroscopic techniques has accelerated the development of biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity. Nanoscale metasurfaces can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional optical methods, such as low responsivity and molecular specificity. One promising approach for analyzing subtle biochemical changes that occur in complex biological phenomena is to use terahertz metasurfaces. Here, the aim is to develop a dual&#8208;selective terahertz nanodisc metasurface that enabled precise monitoring of neurotransmitter dynamics in a biomimetic environment. Utilizing functionalized terahertz metasurfaces with nanodisc that mimic biosensory receptors, a biosensor selective for both molecular type and resonant frequency is developed. The sensing platform ensures significantly enhanced sensitivity and specificity by recognizing the intermolecular changes associated with serotonin&#8208;nanodisc binding and aqueous surrounding effects. The proposed biosensor can potentially provide an efficient tool for studying complex biochemical interactions, and find application in biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience research.

         <title>Conformal Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Silicon: Toward Bio&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Infrared Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformal Mac&#8208;imprint technology employs stretchable porous polymer stamps coated with a gold catalyst that are pneumatically actuated against curved silicon lenses, electrochemically carving micrometer, hierarchical sharklet patterns in a single maskless step. The centimeter&#8208;scale metasurfaces exhibit &lt;1% pitch error, broadband anti&#8208;reflection, offering a durable and robust monolithic pathway to micro&#8208;machining multifunctional photonic coating for harsh environments such as space exploration and the battlefield.








Abstract
Nanostructured anti&#8208;reflection metasurfaces for infrared lenses are designed for imaging in harsh environments such as dust (e.g., moon or battlefield), micrometeorites (e.g., Lagrange points), and high&#8208;radiation fluctuations (e.g., Mars) with limited lifetimes. These multifunctional optical meta&#8208;surfaces (MOMS) simultaneously deliver high thermal stability and anti&#8208;fouling behavior due to their monolithic nature (e.g., no mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion), hydrophobicity, and low dust adherence. However, the incompatibility of inorganic semiconductor micromachining with non&#8208;planar substrates has limited MOMS to polymeric and glass lenses. Here, a new method of conformal electrochemical nanoimprinting is presented to directly micromachine a nature&#8208;inspired MOMS onto a silicon lens. Uniquely, stretchablegold&#8208;coated&#160;patterned&#160;porous PVDF stamps are made by lithographically templated thermally induced phase separation (lt&#8208;TIPS), which simultaneously embeds it with (i) interconnected porosity for promoting mass transport, (ii) HF&#8208;resistance for increasing operational lifetime, and (iii) stretchable electronic nanocoatings (i.e., Au) that can catalyze the electrochemical process. In a demonstration of its hierarchical micromachining capability, a sharklet microscale pattern is successfully transferred to a silicon lens with anti&#8208;reflective and hydrophobic properties. This work paves the way for MOMS&#8217; extension onto inorganic semiconductors and IR lenses.

         <title>Revisiting The Role of Entropy for Charge Separation in 1D Pi&#8208;Conjugated Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes solution&#8208;phase microwave conductivity to study charge generation in a 1D model system of semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (s&#8208;SWCNTs) in low&#8208;dielectric solvent. The observation of high conductivity, even for much less than one dopant per s&#8208;SWCNT on average, demonstrates that entropy plays a key role in facilitating charge carrier escape in 1D systems, despite prior suggestions to the contrary.









Abstract
Free carrier generation in organic donor/acceptor heterojunctions and redox&#8208;doped organic semiconductors is poorly understood, since assumed tight electron&#8211;hole binding conflicts with observed high free carrier yields. Cornerstone analyses that have guided the field for over 15 years predict that entropy can stabilize free charges in 2D and 3D pi&#8208;conjugated semiconductors but not in 1D systems. Here, the impact of entropy on charge generation in 1D pi&#8208;conjugated semiconductors is revisited by exploiting a greatly simplified system where enthalpy considerations alone should not allow for free charge generation. Noncontact solution&#8208;phase microwave conductivity is used to investigate the carrier density&#8208;dependent conductivity and dielectric constant in isolated chemically doped semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes in a low&#8208;dielectric solvent. Dopant chemical structure dramatically influences the carrier density&#8208;dependent complex conductivity, with bulky dopants facilitating carrier escape even at carrier densities below one carrier per nanotube. Three distinct numerical calculations show that entropic stabilization dramatically lowers the Gibbs energy barrier for free charge generation, explaining the high yield of free carriers, even in 1D. This renewed understanding of entropy's role in carrier generation has important implications for designing organic electronic devices&#8211;such as solar cells and thermoelectric energy harvesters&#8211;for enhanced carrier yield, conductivity, and performance.

         <title>Stepped Disconnection&#8208;Contributing AgRuIr Nanocrystals with Turtle Shell&#8208;Shaped Oxide Layer for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepped disconnections provide broken local spatial symmetry, tailored electronic bands structures and localized chemical environments that enhance catalytic activity. Herein, ultrafine AgRuIr nanocrystals with dense stepped disconnections are prepared by introducing large&#8208;sized Ag atoms preferentially located at the line defects between the nanocrystalline domains divided by the stepped disconnection&#8208;mediated grain boundaries, via fast and non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization.








Abstract
Stepped disconnections enable innovative catalyst design by breaking spatial symmetry, tailoring electronic bands, and creating localized chemical environments for synergistic water oxidation catalysis. We developed ultrafine AgRuIr nanocrystals with dense stepped disconnections through rapid non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization using medium&#8208;temperature alcohol&#8208;assisted thermal reduction. Large&#8208;sized Ag atoms preferentially located at the line defects between the nanocrystalline domains divided by the stepped disconnection&#8208;mediated grain boundaries. The atomic Ag&#8208;stabilized stepped disconnections across nanocrystalline domains create turtle shell&#8208;shaped oxide layer with abnormal twisted strips, which remarkably enhance H2O adsorption and activation kinetics. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional acidic water oxidation performance with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 188 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;low 1.82 V electrolysis voltage at 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 in AgRuIr&#8741;Pt/C modules, achieving 42.81 kWh/kg H2 efficiency meeting DOE 2026 targets. Enhanced activity originates from abnormal H2O aggregation/activation along twisted strips containing disrupted oxygen/metal atoms at Ag&#8208;rich defect lines. Crucially, Ag&#8208;pinned stepped dislocations beneath the active oxide layer inhibit Ru/Ir leaching by elevating lattice diffusion barriers, ensuring operational stability. This work establishes a paradigm for designing next&#8208;generation proton exchange membrane water electrolysis catalysts through engineered stepped disconnection architectures that simultaneously optimize activity and durability.

         <title>Enhancing Li+ Kinetics Via Selective Repulsion&#8208;Adsorption and Intermolecular Ion&#8208;Conduction Layers for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a PSS&#8208;MMT composite layer on the anode of anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries. PSS will self&#8208;assemble, and its non&#8208;polar components repel solvents while negatively charged MMT adsorbs Li&#8314;, accelerating desolvation and forming inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Within the layer, there is a Li+ transfer pathway between PSS and MMT with reduced migration barriers. Consequently, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries achieve stable cycle performance.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries, offer high energy density, but suffer from limited lifespan due to sluggish Li+ desolvation at the anode. Conventional artificial layers on the anode attract Li+ by polar groups, yet inadvertently accumulate solvent molecules near these polar layers, impede desolvation, and form an organic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with low ionic conductivity. Herein, a selective repulsion&#8208;adsorption strategy is proposed, achieved using a layer (MS layer, 35&#160;nm) comprising polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and montmorillonite (MMT). During electrospray fabrication, the PSS self&#8208;assemble, with non&#8208;polar benzene rings and C&#8208;H main chains facing outward, while the &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups are buried underneath. The non&#8208;polar components can repel polar solvent molecules, and negatively charged MMT will absorb Li+, suppressing solvent accumulation and facilitating desolvation. Meanwhile, the anions attracted by MMT will form an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI with superior ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the PSS&#8208;MMT interface forms a rapid Li+ transport pathway with reduced migration barriers. Consequently, anode&#8208;free MS&#8208;Cu||LFP cells operate over 350 cycles, increasing &#8776;200% compared with Cu||LFP cells. Additionally, 2 Ah anode&#8208;free MS&#8208;Cu||LFP (340&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and MS&#8208;Cu||NCM811 pouch cells (490&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) maintain 80% capacity after 100 and 50 cycles. This work presents an efficient strategy to enhance Li+ kinetics for high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Polyelectrolytes as a Stable and Tunable Platform for Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) are introduced as advanced materials for triboelectric nanogenerators, offering precise control over tribopolarity through selective ion fixation. The tunable triboelectric properties and reliable mechanical and thermal stability of PEs enable enhanced output performance and long&#8208;term reliability, establishing a foundation for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting and sensing technologies.








Abstract
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) provide a versatile material system for improving the efficiency and stability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Compared to conventional ionic liquids (ILs), which suffer from leakage, environmental instability, and limited durability, PEs feature covalently tethered ionic groups that enable precise tribopolarity control while preventing unwanted ion migration. By systematically varying polymer backbones and ionic compositions, including two polycations and three polyanions, tunable triboelectric behavior is demonstrated using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and TENG output measurements. The polymethyl acrylate (PMA)&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion shows strongly tribopositive behavior, producing 83 V compared to 45 V for PMA. The polystyrene (PS)&#8208;based polyanion&#160;with 10% ion inclusion exhibits strongly tribonegative behavior with 34 V, compared to 8 V for PS. Optimizing ion ratios enhances charge retention by suppressing excessive ionic conduction. The mechanical and thermal stability of PEs is demonstrated by output measurements over time; for example, the short&#8208;circuit current of PMA&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion remains nearly unchanged after 1 week at 60&#160;&#176;C, in contrast to an &#8776;27% drop observed in a polymer&#8208;IL system (poly(methyl methacrylate) with 10 wt% IL). These findings highlight the suitability of PEs as a robust, stable, and tunable platform for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;harvesting applications.

Albendazole (ALB) post&#8208;treatment mitigated [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) aggregation and poor wettability, enhancing perovskite film crystallinity, optimizing energy&#8208;level alignment, reducing interfacial defects, and enhancing the carrier transport properties, resulting in a 1.67&#160;eV inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell with 22.68% power conversion efficiency (PCE) and achieving 29.06% efficiency in a four&#8208;terminal tandem with a CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) subcell.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled materials (SAMs) like [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) are commonly used as hole transport layers (HTLs) in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells. However, the poor wettability of perovskite precursor solutions on Me&#8208;4PACz and its polarity&#8208;induced aggregation hinder high&#8208;quality film formation. To address these challenges, albendazole (ALB) is introduced as a surface modifier for Me&#8208;4PACz. The ALB solution mitigates the aggregation of Me&#8208;4PACz and promotes the desorption and rearrangement process of weakly bound Me&#8208;4PACz molecules. Concurrently, its Lewis basic moiety improves film quality, reduces buried interfacial defects, and optimizes energy level alignment. Additionally, ALB forms directional &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with Me&#8208;4PACz, ultimately suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitating charge carrier transport. As a result, ALB&#8208;optimized inverted WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.68%, with unencapsulated devices retaining 93.87% of their initial efficiency after 736&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under illumination. Furthermore, integrating the ALB&#8208;modified semi&#8208;transparent perovskite top cell with a 1.03&#160;eV bandgap CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) bottom cell yields a four&#8208;terminal tandem device with an impressive total efficiency of 29.06%. This dual&#8208;objective strategy provides a simple and effective method for simultaneously improving the film quality of both the HTL and the perovskite layer.

         <title>Borate&#8208;Water&#8208;Based 3D&#8208;Slime Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This advanced material, composed of lithium borate, lithium salt, and water, is a quasi&#8208;solid that can be handled in air and has a 3D&#8208;conducting&#8208;interface network (3D&#8208;Slime&#8208;Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes: 3D&#8208;SLISE). The 3D&#8208;SLISE is nonflammable and can be used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, and its water solubility allows direct recycling of active materials. This technology can contribute to the creation of a battery&#8208;recycling society.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that do not use hazardous materials as electrolytes and are not flammable is progressing rapidly, however the production of sulfide&#8208;based SSBs requires strict low&#8208;dew&#8208;point control due to their high reactivity with atmospheric moisture and the concern of generating hydrogen sulfide, and several issues remain in terms of the cost and recyclability. Thus, low&#8208;cost facile materials and low&#8208;CO2&#8208;emission processes are necessary. With regard to oxide&#8208;type SSBs, which are attracting attention for their safety, there are issues with manufacturing suitability, as high&#8208;temperature sintering of oxide solid electrolyte particles is required. A new quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrolyte with 3D&#8208;ionic conduction and adhesive interfaces by combining amorphous Li2B4O7 and water (3D&#8208;Slime Interface Solid Electrolyte: 3D&#8208;SLISE) is synthesized without stringent dew point control and sintering. Electrode and electrolyte slurries containing 3D&#8208;SLISE are applied to current&#8208;collecting foils in air, naturally dried, and used to construct battery laminates. 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSBs (LiCoO2 cathode/3D&#8208;SLISE with 7 wt.% bound&#8208;water/Li4Ti5O12 or TiNb2O7 anodes) maintain several hundred cycles of charge/discharge as a 2.35&#160;V lithium&#8208;ion battery. The 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSB technology can promote the use of safe and low&#8208;cost batteries, eliminate the need for a dry room during manufacturing, and enable direct recycling of active materials.

         <title>Terahertz In&#8208;Sensor Computing Utilizing Photothermoelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi2Se3&#8208;based THz detection array, synthesized via low&#8208;temperature pulse irradiation, exhibits a tunable bidirectional response driven by the photothermoelectric effect. This self&#8208;powered sensor achieves a high responsivity of 200 V&#160;W&#8722;1 and an ultrafast response time of &lt;5 ms at 0.3 THz, enabling real&#8208;time in&#8208;sensor computing and facilitating high&#8208;precision object detection in biomedical and security applications.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) detection is pivotal for biomedical diagnostics and security screening, enabled by its non&#8208;ionizing nature and characteristic &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; spectra. However, weak THz&#8211;matter interactions, energy&#8208;intensive processing, and complex hardware integration hinder its practical use. To this aim, a layered bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3)&#8208;based THz detection array is fabricated via low&#8208;temperature pulse irradiation synthesis (PIS), exhibiting a tunable thermally coupled bidirectional response. The intrinsic photothermoelectric (PTE) effect enables adaptive in&#8208;sensor THz signal processing, achieving 200&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity and &lt;5&#160;ms response time at 0.3 THz in a self&#8208;powered mode. Integrated in&#8208;sensor computing enhances accuracy through real&#8208;time noise suppression, edge detection, and feature extraction. The array also demonstrates high imaging performance, with a &gt;90% recall rate for concealed object detection. This work provides a scalable, high&#8208;precision THz sensing platform with transformative potential for biomedical and security applications.

It is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries represent a compelling next&#8208;generation energy storage system with practical energy densities exceeding 700 Wh kg&#8722;1, offering a promising pathway beyond current lithium&#8208;ion technology. However, their commercial viability remains constrained by deleterious interfacial reactions between lithium metal anodes and polysulfide&#8208;containing electrolytes. Herein, it is presented a molecular engineering approach through a novel boron&#8208;based salt, lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB), strategically designed to reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries. LiFPB anions, featuring higher specific charge (mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge ratio) and larger steric bulk compared to conventional salts, demonstrate enhanced resistance to Helmholtz double&#8208;layer repulsion and increased susceptibility to lithium metal reduction, promoting the formation of a robust SEI enriched with LiF and LiBxOy species. The LiFPB&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits superior lithium metal compatibility, achieving a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59%. Consequently, Li&#8208;S cells demonstrate markedly improved capacity retention from 50.9% to 75.7% over 200 cycles. This strategy has been successfully scaled to Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells, achieving practical energy densities of 408 Wh kg&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 75 cycles. This work presents an effective approach to developing long&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;S batteries through the rational design of electrolyte salt.

         <title>Multigrain Ruthenium Nanocrystals with Enriched (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) Facets for Enhanced Hydrogen Oxidation in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multigrain Ru nanocatalyst with abundant (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets shows&#160;exceptional hydrogen oxidation activity and stability up to 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in alkali. It achieves peak power densities of 1.06 and 1.31 W cm&#8315;2 in hydrogen&#8208;air and hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cells, respectively, and retains performance over 60 h with negligible decay.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based materials are promising alternatives to expensive platinum for the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but face stability issues due to the strong oxophilicity. Here, an oxidation&#8208;resistant ruthenium multigrain catalyst is reported that exposes rich (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets for high&#8208;performing HOR catalysis in alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst exhibits a high kinetic current density of 61&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 50&#160;mV, which is 25.6&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;times higher than that of commercial ruthenium&#8208;carbon and platinum&#8208;carbon catalysts, respectively. Moreover, it also demonstrates a wide stability window up to 0.3&#160;V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode and enhanced tolerance to carbon monoxide. An AEMFC containing this catalyst at the anode achieves peak power densities of 1.31 and 1.06&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under hydrogen&#8208;oxygen and hydrogen&#8208;air conditions at 90&#160;&#176;C, respectively, and operates steadily. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facet possesses a higher oxidation barrier and lower hydrogen oxidation barrier than the common (0002) facets, enabling the exceptional HOR performances in alkali.

         <title>Ah&#8208;Level Large&#8208;Format Fiber&#8208;Shaped Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Effective Field Homogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;format fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (L&#8208;FLIBs) beyond 2 m in length are developed by homogenizing the electric field along fiber axis. The as&#8208;assembled L&#8208;FLIBs can deliver a 0.4 W high power output, corresponding to a 40% power increment. Furthermore, an unprecedented single&#8208;cell capacity of &gt;1 Ah is achieved.








Abstract
Large&#8208;format fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (L&#8208;FLIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible and wearable electronics but suffer significant cell polarization and insufficient active material utilization after scaling up. The heterogeneous spatial electric field distribution fundamentally affects the electrochemical behavior and jeopardizes the performance of L&#8208;FLIBs, yet its influence on 1D fiber structures remains unexplored. Here, the electron transport mechanisms are systematically investigated and develop an optimized dual&#8208;terminal cell configuration for field homogenizing. Through equivalent circuit modeling and experimental validation, it is revealed that strategic electron collection terminal design establishes symmetric electric fields along the fiber length, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of electrochemical heterogeneity and enhancing the redox kinetics for L&#8208;FLIBs. Thereby, a 60% internal resistance reduction is achieved and successfully fabricated a 10&#8208;m&#8208;long L&#8208;FLIBs with an unprecedented 1 Ah high capacity for a single fiber cell. The practical capability of this design is demonstrated by integrating large&#8208;format batteries into a fabric power bank for portable electronics.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Atomic Metal Deposition for an Efficient Dual&#8208;Site Incorporated Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition method using metal carbonyl precursors at 100&#160;&#176;C. The approach is applicable not only to TiO2 but also to various carbon&#8208;based and oxide materials. Among these, W oxo&#8208;clusters stabilize surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 and have been effectively utilized in the benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol reaction. These findings highlight the potential of this simplified and energy&#8208;efficient method for the scalable production of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.








Abstract
A universal, low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition (LTAMD) strategy is herein reported for synthesis of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) using metal carbonyl precursors. This scalable approach enables the fabrication of diverse ADMCs with various transition metals, including W, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru, Rh, and Re on oxide and carbon&#8208;based supports. Tungsten&#8208;incorporated TiO2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic benzene oxidation activity, attributed to the generation of surface oxygen vacancies with Ti3+, which act as active reduction sites under aerobic conditions, facilitating the formation of reduced oxygen intermediates. It is demonstrated that tungsten plays a crucial role in stabilizing these oxygen vacancies and promoting electron&#8208;hole separation by accommodating photogenerated holes and activating the C&#9472;H bond of benzene. Leveraging dual&#8208;site photocatalysis, the tungsten&#8208;TiO2 system achieves a remarkable 42.7% yield in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol, with high recyclability over ten cycles. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental results, a distinct photocatalytic mechanism is unveiled, driven by the synergistic interaction between atomic tungsten and TiO2. This strategy not only enables the energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of a broad range of ADMCs on various supports but also enhances the intrinsic catalytic properties of the TiO2 photocatalyst without compromising its crystal or electronic structure.

Integrates electrochemically Turing&#8208;nanoarchitected Ag needle frameworks with conformal ZIF&#8208;8 coating, the hierarchical structure enables dual&#8208;scale enhancement that mesoscopic light manipulation and microscopic molecular enrichment. The injector&#8208;integrated design seamlessly interfaces with portable Raman systems, achieving rapid in situ detection of contaminants in untreated solid matrices with sub&#8208;millimeter spatial resolution&#8212;a transformative leap toward field&#8208;deployable chemical diagnostics.








Abstract
The spontaneous emergence of Turing patterns in biological systems has inspired advanced materials with superior performance, yet their untapped potential in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology offers a transformative frontier. Mirroring the anti&#8208;reflective coating of insect eyes, where Turing&#8208;patterned corneal protrusions form graded refractive index interfaces with the lens, a bioinspired integration of Turing&#8208;nanoarchitected Ag (TN&#8208;Ag) with in situ zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) growth is engineered. The electrochemically sculpted fractal framework on silver needles serves dual roles as plasmonic amplifiers and curvature&#8208;guided templates for ZIF&#8208;8 growth, spatially aligning electromagnetic hotspots with selective&#8208;enrichment porous channels. The TN&#8208;Ag/ZIF&#8208;8 hierarchical architecture enables dual&#8208;scale SERS enhancement through mesoscopic light modulation via refractive index gradients and microscopic molecular enrichment through size&#8208;selective pores. Leveraging 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid as a dual&#8208;recognition probe, this platform achieves ultrasensitive discrimination and detection of Hg2+ (10&#8722;10 m) and methylmercury (10&#8722;8&#160;m) with exceptional interference resistance and practical reliability. Further, its injector&#8208;integrated design permits direct sampling in untreated solid matrices while seamlessly interfacing with portable Raman systems, demonstrating readiness for real&#8208;world environmental monitoring and food safety diagnostics. By transmuting biomimetic principles into functional nanofabrication, this work establishes a universal paradigm for next&#8208;generation on&#8208;site chemical analysis, uniting biological design logic with engineered sensing demands.

         <title>Enabling Multielectron Reaction of Polyanionic Cathodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Calcium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is developed to unlock the persistent challenge of single electron transfer per ion insertion in polyanionic materials. The cathode achieves a 1.87&#8208;electron transfer in Ca&#8208;ion cells by in situ activated multielectron reaction, thus offering a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 for advanced calcium rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Polyanionic cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Ca2+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in propelling the development of calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs). However, polyanionic cathodes usually exhibit single&#8208;electron transfer per unit, rendering limited specific capacity and energy densities. Herein, a new polyanionic CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is proposed for high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable CIBs by unlocking 1.87&#8208;electron transfer per vanadium redox center during Ca ion insertion. The CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 cathode delivers a reversible calcium storage capacity of 162 mAh g&#8722;1 at an average voltage of &#8776;2.5 V at 10 mA g&#8722;1, featuring a record&#8208;high energy density of &#8776;400 Wh kg&#8722;1. The low volume changes (&#8710;V = 1.8%) and fast diffusion kinetics indicate excellent cycling stability of CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 with capacity retentions of 98.2% and 80.8% over 600 and 5000 cycles, respectively. In Ca metal full cells made from a Ca metal anode and a compatible electrolyte, the CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 presents a high energy density of 318 Wh kg&#8722;1 over 50 cycles, which rivals the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CIB performance. This work sheds new light on the electrochemically activated multielectron redox reactions of polyanionic cathode materials for sustainable CIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance p&#8208;Type 1D Van der Waals Electronics Prepared Through Solution Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance p&#8208;type transistors are realized via solution&#8208;processed van der Waals tellurium nanowires, exhibiting excellent mobility and scalability. The negligible mobility degradation at Te&#8208;Te junctions enables large&#8208;area films with remarkable device performance, advancing low&#8208;cost electronics.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based methods have emerged as a promising approach for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electronics fabrication. However, solution processing has rarely realized high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type transistors, impeding the advancement of solution&#8208;processed electronics. Among the various solution&#8208;processable material families, van der Waals (vdW) systems stand out due to several attractive features, one of which is the atomically defined interfaces that facilitate carrier charge transport, enabling enhanced device performance. Here, the preparation of transistors based on single tellurium (Te) nanowires (NW) is demonstrated, achieving high mobilities averaging &#8776;370 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Notably, subsequent studies reveal that devices based on Te&#8208;Te NW junctions exhibit mobilities comparable to those of the individual NWs forming the junction. This indicates that the vdW contact between the Te NWs causes negligible degradation in the mobility, which aligns with the theoretical calculations. Based on this finding, a large&#8208;area 1D Te NWs vdW film is further prepared, consisting of a large number of 1D Te NWs interconnected by vdW junctions. The resulting transistors can still maintain remarkable operating characteristics, including an average field&#8208;effect hole mobility of &#8776;94.9 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, a subthreshold swing of &#8776;248.6 mVdec&#8722;1, a current on/off ratio of &#8776;104, and a low operating voltage of 1&#160;V.

         <title>&#8220;Rigid&#8208;Flexible&#8221; Strategy Realizes Robust Ultralong Phosphorescence for Multifunctional Display Unit and Photoreceptor Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous phosphorescent polymer is realized with a narrow band, long lifetime, and high efficiency by introducing a planar chromophore BCz into polymer PVB through a rigid&#8208;flexible approach. The film has a phosphorescence lifetime of 4.71 s, a phosphorescence efficiency of 42.1%, and a FWHM of 24 nm. Surprisingly, the films exhibit unique photoactivation properties and good environmental stability, enabling storage in high humidity environments for extended periods of time and even in aqueous environments. Full&#8208;color stable phosphorescence emission is achieved through a triplet&#8208;FRET strategy and applied to luminescent displays, 3D printing, and simulation of photoreceptor synapses.








Abstract
Amorphous materials are highly attractive for the development of ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) due to their ease of processing, scalability, and flexibility. However, the realization of stable URTP polymers remains a great challenge. Here, it is reported a robust and flexible approach to realize high&#8208;quality URTP polymers by doping the organic phosphor into the polymer matrix with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. This unique structure enables double confinement of the triplet exciton of phosphor, resulting in ultra&#8208;bright amorphous URTP films. URTP films exhibit narrow&#8208;band emission, ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence lifetime, ultra&#8208;high phosphorescence efficiency, and distinctive photoactivation properties, with intense phosphorescence emission observable even in daylight. Furthermore, it is demonstrated color&#8208;tunable emission through f&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and explores its potential applications in 3D printing, patterned displays, and bionic photoreceptor synapses. The work provides valuable insights into the design of robust, high&#8208;quality phosphorescent materials, which could pave the way for a wide range of applications in display and bionic technologies.

         <title>Super Stable Moisture&#8208;Responsive Actuator via Covalent Crosslinking for Efficient Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents highly stable moisture&#8208;responsive textiles for personal thermal management. Citric acid&#8208;crosslinked bacterial cellulose smart textile retains performance through 200 humidity cycles and 100 washing cycles&#8212;enhancing washing stability by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. The textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% (even 186.2% at 12 km h&#8722;1 wind) and lowers skin temperature by &#8776;1.96&#160;&#176;C during exercise.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;responsive actuators exhibit significant potential for applications in personal thermal management. However, their cyclic stability, particularly under washing conditions, remains a critical challenge. In this study, moisture&#8208;responsive actuators are developed composed of bacterial cellulose chemically crosslinked with citric acid for use in moisture&#8208;responsive textiles. Simulation results demonstrate that the covalent cross&#8208;linking network effectively stabilizes the microstructure of the material, thereby preserving its moisture&#8208;responsive performance after 200 humidity cycles and 100 washing cycles. Compared to previously reported materials, the washing stability has been enhanced by approximately one to two orders of magnitude without compromise in thermal management performance. Relative to conventional textiles, the engineered smart textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% and achieves an outstanding 186.2% improvement at a wind speed of 12&#160;km h&#8722;1. Furthermore, it reduces skin temperature by approximately 1.96&#160;&#176;C during strenuous physical activity, showcasing superior moisture regulation and heat dissipation capabilities. This research presents a robust methodology for enhancing the durability of functional textiles, thereby promoting their broader application in personal thermal management systems.

The textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% (even 186.2% at 12 km h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; wind) and lowers skin temperature by &#8776;1.96&#160;&#176;C during exercise.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moisture-responsive actuators exhibit significant potential for applications in personal thermal management. However, their cyclic stability, particularly under washing conditions, remains a critical challenge. In this study, moisture-responsive actuators are developed composed of bacterial cellulose chemically crosslinked with citric acid for use in moisture-responsive textiles. Simulation results demonstrate that the covalent cross-linking network effectively stabilizes the microstructure of the material, thereby preserving its moisture-responsive performance after 200 humidity cycles and 100 washing cycles. Compared to previously reported materials, the washing stability has been enhanced by approximately one to two orders of magnitude without compromise in thermal management performance. Relative to conventional textiles, the engineered smart textile extends the thermal comfort zone by 25.4% and achieves an outstanding 186.2% improvement at a wind speed of 12&#160;km h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, it reduces skin temperature by approximately 1.96&#160;&#176;C during strenuous physical activity, showcasing superior moisture regulation and heat dissipation capabilities. This research presents a robust methodology for enhancing the durability of functional textiles, thereby promoting their broader application in personal thermal management systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Lewis Acid Effect in the Pores of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Host for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents AlFx@MIL&#8208;101, a 3D MOF&#8208;based host for lithium metal anodes. The unsaturated AlFx with strong Lewis acidity can fix anions and solvents, enhancing Li+ dissociation, desolvation, and transport while reducing concentration polarization. The 3D AlFx@MIL&#8208;101 host suppresses electrode expansion, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and stripping during cycling in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The homogeneous introduction of Lewis acid sites into 3D hosts of Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial for promoting Li+ dissociation and desolvation. Herein, the use of MIL&#8208;101, a well&#8208;known flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, loaded with uniformly distributed AlFx species with unsaturated Lewis acid sites, is proposed as a Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) 3D host to promote Li+ dissociation and desolvation in LMBs. A symmetrical cell using an AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu with pre&#8208;deposited lithium (Li@AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu) exhibits stable performance for over 3600 h. In addition, a high&#8208;loading LFP||Li@AlFx@MIL&#8208;101/Cu full cell maintains high capacity after 4000 cycles at 1 C with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.87%. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the AlFx species with strong Lewis acidity and MIL&#8208;101 with nanospace confinement effect promote Li+ dissociation and desolvation coupled with fast and uniform Li+ transport. The MIL&#8208;101 pores accommodate Li species, thereby inhibiting volume changes in the LMA. These results demonstrate that AlFx@MIL&#8208;101 ensures uniform and dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on LMAs, making it a promising host for high&#8208;stability LMBs.

         <title>K&#8208;Edge&#8208;Inspired Selenomelanin Hydrogel: An X&#8208;Ray Filtering Biomaterial for Skin Protection in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by developing an X&#8208;ray filtering hydrogel, achieving skin protection in radiotherapy. The hydrogel exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray harm to skin through the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge in SeMNPs, while maintaining over 98% transmission for therapeutic photons.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely employed in cancer treatment, yet its inevitable side effects, particularly radiation dermatitis (RD), remain a significant concern. Numerous studies focus on alleviating RD symptoms, but approaches to minimize the radiation dose to the skin are underexplored. Shielding skin&#8208;damaging photons (10&#8211;20 keV) holds promise for skin dose reduction; however, this strategy is hindered by inadequate shielding efficiency of current RD biomaterials and overshielding by conventional high&#8208;Z materials which attenuate therapeutic high&#8208;energy photons. Here, inspired by the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge, an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by integrating selenium&#8208;containing melanin nanoparticles with a carbomer hydrogel is proposed, developing an X&#8208;ray filtering skin dressing (SeMNPs@Car). It exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray (10&#8211;20 keV) while maintaining over 98% transmission for high&#8208;energy photons. In RD animal models, the SeMNPs@Car achieves 100% prevention of ulceration and the longest delay in the onset of RD (&#8776;20 days), outperforming clinical RD treatments. Furthermore, Monte&#8208;Carlo&#8208;based reconstruction of radiotherapy scenarios demonstrates its clinical applicability. This work incorporates photoelectric absorption properties into hydrogel design, providing valuable insights for RD management and the creation of soft&#8208;material&#8208;based X&#8208;ray filters.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry 2D Ta2PtSe7 Induced by Ultralong Structural Motifs for Flexible Long&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection up to 10.6 &#181;m</title>

Through a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy employing structural motif engineering, ultra&#8208;low&#8208;symmetry Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers featuring unprecedented 20.1&#160;&#197;&#8208;long [Ta4Pt2Se14] motifs were discovered. This extended motif architecture enables exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, confirmed by direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. Notably, the bandgap&#8208;independent photoresponse of 2D Ta2PtSe7 achieves 27 V/W at 10.6 &#181;m while maintaining &gt;70% of its initial photocurrent throughout 50 bending cycles.








Abstract
The limited ability of traditional 2D anisotropic materials to meet next&#8208;generation anisotropic device demands necessitates innovative design strategies. To address this challenge, a symmetry&#8208;reduction approach is proposed that enhances in&#8208;plane anisotropy by extending structural motifs to lower crystal symmetry. Implementing this design principle, a novel van der Waals material, Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers is successfully developed, featuring record&#8208;breaking [Ta4Pt2Se14] structural motifs with an unprecedented length of 20.1 &#197;. This unique architecture endows Ta2PtSe7 with remarkable intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, manifesting in strongly direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. The developed Ta2PtSe7&#8208;based photodetector demonstrates exceptional broadband responsiveness across an expansive spectral range from visible to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR; 671 nm&#8211;10.6 &#181;m). Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance under low operating voltage (0.1 V), achieving a high responsivity of 27 V&#160;W&#8722;1 at 10.6 &#181;m illumination &#8211; a significant advancement in LWIR detection capabilities. Furthermore, flexible device configurations exhibit excellent mechanical robustness, maintaining over 70% of initial photocurrent after 50 bending cycles, demonstrating promising potential for flexible optoelectronics. This study proposes a novel structural motif engineering strategy to design anisotropic materials, exemplified by Ta2PtSe7&#8217;s exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, broadband photoresponse, and mechanical robustness, enabling high&#8208;performance anisotropic optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Modulating Single&#8208;Atom Pt Coordination for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1) is discovered with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to commercial Pt/C. It is shown that modulating the coordination environment of Pt single atoms is crucial towards dictating the electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional capability of Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1&#160;is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can be used for the on&#8208;demand generation of clean electricity. However, such systems have low efficiency due to the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

&lt;p&gt;A bifunctional Pt single-atom catalyst (Pt-DG-1) is discovered with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to commercial Pt/C. It is shown that modulating the coordination environment of Pt single atoms is crucial towards dictating the electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional capability of Pt-DG-1&#160;is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can be used for the on-demand generation of clean electricity. However, such systems have low efficiency due to the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Prior reports have largely focused on Pt-based electrocatalysts, however, their high cost motivates the need for simultaneously increasing activity whilst reducing the metal loading. Here, the design of a bifunctional Pt single-atom catalyst (SAC) is reported, with enhanced catalytic activities compared to commercial Pt/C for both reactions. Notably, by modulating the Pt SAC coordination, the optimal catalyst (Pt-DG-1) displayed a high AOR mass activity of 1.23 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ORR mass activity of 7.98 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is then integrated into a DAFC as both the cathode and anode, achieving a peak power density of 21.8 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low Pt mass loading of only 0.034 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments on Pt-DG-1 indicate a lower &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OH coverage under ORR conditions and suppressed formation of poisoning species &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; under AOR conditions as additional reasons for its enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Electrolysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Saline Wastewater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated EE&#8208;PR process is developed using a ZrN/CF electrode and AEM flow cell. This system enables rapid, selective, and scalable recovery of uranium from saline nuclear wastewater, offering a low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional solvent&#8208;based extraction methods.








Abstract
Recovery of uranium from residual spent fuel dissolution liquor in nuclear power plants is economically and environmentally desirable. While electrochemical extraction offers a greener alternative to solvent&#8208;based methods like the PUREX (plutonium uranium reduction extraction) process, it has been limited to batch processing of non&#8208;saline waters. Here, a high&#8208;performance ZrN/copper foam (ZrN/CF) electrode is presented that enables a continuous electroextraction&#8208;purification&#8208;reuse (EE&#8208;PR) process, achieving &gt;98% pure UO2 directly from saline wastewater for direct reuse as nuclear fuel. An anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) flow cell for uranium extraction is introduced, integrating it with a ZrN/CF electrode to achieve complete uranium removal within two hours &#8211; an unprecedented efficiency in marine environments. Scalability assessments and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm the environmental and economic feasibility of this approach, with the estimated total cost for extracting uranium comparable to the current market price. As the global adoption of nuclear energy accelerates, this process offers a transformative solution for sustainable uranium recovery and resource management.

         <title>Expanding the Particle Range for Biocatalytically Active Pickering Emulsions with Silicone Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pickering emulsions are a promising class of reaction systems for biocatalysis. However, only a few materials can stabilize the required w/o emulsion. In this study, it is demonstrated that coating microparticles with modified silicone is a straightforward, versatile, and tunable method for producing appropriate particles. Consequently, enzyme carriers can be employed as emulsion stabilizers and immobilization materials, thereby intensifying reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Pickering emulsions (PEs) are a particularly promising class of reaction systems for biocatalysis, typically in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (w/o) configuration, with a continuous organic phase and a dispersed aqueous phase containing the biocatalyst. However, only a few micro&#8208; and nanoparticles possess the intrinsic hydrophobicity necessary to stabilize such a w/o PE, which limits the application prospects. Here, silicone coatings are applied to prepare micro particles for w/o PE stabilization for the first time. The study demonstrates compatibility with available inorganic and organic materials, and the effects of silicone coatings with overall hydrophilic, amphiphilic, or hydrophobic properties on the particle size, PE formation, and the stability of the PE. Furthermore, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed transesterification in PE obtained with silicone&#8208;coated particles is performed, and the possibility to place the catalyst not only in the dispersed phase of the PE, but also on the stabilizing particles prior to coating is demonstrated. The results indicate silicone coatings as a straightforward, versatile, and tunable method for the preparation of particles with suitable properties for both the stabilization of BioPE and the immobilization of active biocatalysts.

         <title>Over 20% Efficient Water&#8208;Based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with High Thickness Tolerance Enabled by Surfactant Promoted Electrostatic Interaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;engineered donor nanoparticles using doubly anionic surfactant SDP enhance electrostatic contrast, optimizing vertical morphology in thick films (300&#8211;400 nm). Water&#8208;based donor inks and non&#8208;halogenated processing enable eco&#8208;friendly fabrication. Devices achieve record efficiencies: 18.9% for binary (300 nm) and 20.3% for ternary systems, respectively, demonstrating unprecedented thickness tolerance and industrial potential.








Abstract
Aqueous processing represents a promising eco&#8208;friendly fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), aligning with growing industrial sustainability requirements. While water&#8208;dispersed semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) offer an attractive solution, the essential surfactants required for NP stabilization typically compromise device performance. In this study, surfactant&#8208;engineered donor NPs are systematically evaluated for constructing optimized active layers through a sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition approach. The surfactant named sodium dodecyl phosphate (SDP), featuring dual anionic charges, generates exceptional electrostatic potential (ESP) differences that promote strong donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. This electrostatic engineering enables the formation of a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction structure (PPHJ) with ideal vertically graded morphologies in thick active layers. Therefore, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO binary OSC processed by mesostructured NP (mn)&#8208;LBL (SDP) strategy shows excellent thickness tolerance and achieved a PCE of 18.9% (certified as 18.3%) with a 300 nm active layer. Furthermore, the mn&#8208;LBL OSCs with the ternary PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 deliver a champion PCE of 20.3% (certified as 19.9%) processed by a non&#8208;halogenated water/toluene solvent system. This work establishes a general surfactant selection paradigm that simultaneously addresses the conflicting demands of nanoparticle stabilization, morphological control, and device performance, paving the way for sustainable manufacturing of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

Iron&#8208;catalyzed laser&#8208;induced graphitization (IC&#8208;LIG)&#160;enables the eco&#8208;efficient fabrication of current collector&#8208;free carbon electrodes on renewable substrates,&#160;outperforming traditional methods. Tunable ink rheology supports spray coating, screen printing, and DIW of complex patterns, while laser post&#8208;treatment allows spatial control of iron phases.

Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed laser&#8208;induced graphitization (IC&#8208;LIG) represents an eco&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional carbon electrode manufacturing. Combining a bio&#8208;based tannic acid&#8211;iron precursor ink with CO2 laser treatment results in sheet resistance of 23.59&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#937;&#160;&#9633;&#8722;1 on renewable substrates. Varying the tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;to&#8208;iron ratio (TA:Fe), the rheology of the precursor ink can be tuned, enabling versatile application techniques, including spray coating, screen printing, and direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW). Subsequent laser&#8208;treatment enables the formation of functional IC&#8208;LIG electrodes for all application methods, while even thick DIW&#8208;printed layers (260&#160;&#181;m) result in complex, conductive electrode patterns. Laser post&#8208;treatment expands design possibilities by locally tuning iron phases, such as converting &#947;&#8208;iron to magnetite. The unidirectional laser&#8208;treatment results in a layered arrangement, forming a multilayer electrode with a highly graphitized top layer serving as a current collector substitute, and an underlying composite of iron&#8208;rich nanoparticles embedded in a porous graphitic foam, acting as a hybrid electrode. Electrochemical analysis reveals double&#8208;layer capacitor behavior at low TA:Fe ratios, while higher ratios demonstrate increased redox activity and pseudo&#8208;capacitive characteristics. Achieving stable capacities of 15&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a 1&#160;M NaCl electrolyte over 5000 cycles underscores the potential of IC&#8208;LIG electrodes as a sustainable solution for advanced energy storage devices and beyond.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-catalyzed laser-induced graphitization (IC-LIG) represents an eco-efficient alternative to traditional carbon electrode manufacturing. Combining a bio-based tannic acid&#8211;iron precursor ink with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser treatment results in sheet resistance of 23.59&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#937;&#160;&#9633;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on renewable substrates. Varying the tannic-acid-to-iron ratio (TA:Fe), the rheology of the precursor ink can be tuned, enabling versatile application techniques, including spray coating, screen printing, and direct-ink-writing (DIW). Subsequent laser-treatment enables the formation of functional IC-LIG electrodes for all application methods, while even thick DIW-printed layers (260&#160;&#181;m) result in complex, conductive electrode patterns. Laser post-treatment expands design possibilities by locally tuning iron phases, such as converting &#947;-iron to magnetite. The unidirectional laser-treatment results in a layered arrangement, forming a multilayer electrode with a highly graphitized top layer serving as a current collector substitute, and an underlying composite of iron-rich nanoparticles embedded in a porous graphitic foam, acting as a hybrid electrode. Electrochemical analysis reveals double-layer capacitor behavior at low TA:Fe ratios, while higher ratios demonstrate increased redox activity and pseudo-capacitive characteristics. Achieving stable capacities of 15&#160;mF&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a 1&#160;M NaCl electrolyte over 5000 cycles underscores the potential of IC-LIG electrodes as a sustainable solution for advanced energy storage devices and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Ligand&#8208;Dominated Redox Activity in &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>

Through precise d&#8208;orbital optimization, a novel Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer, Ni&#8208;BTA, is synthesized for potassium&#8208;ion battery anodes. The engineered electronic structure, featuring strong Ni2&#8314;&#8211;ligand &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, enhances the stability of the organic framework by strengthening C&#9552;N bonds. This structural reinforcement enables highly reversible electrochemical processes and contributes to the material's exceptional cycling performance and high capacity.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) offer a cost&#8208;effective, resource&#8208;abundant alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet the development of high&#8208;performance anodes with adequate capacity, stability, and rate capability remains a major challenge. Here, an electronic structure engineering strategy is introduced via d&#8208;orbital configuration optimization in a novel class of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated coordination polymers (TM&#8208;BTA, TM = Ni, Co, Mn). Orbital&#8208;level and charge density analyses reveal that the metal center's electronic configuration governs metal&#8211;ligand interaction strength, thereby modulating charge delocalization and ligand redox behavior. Among the series, Ni2&#8314; exhibits the strongest &#960;&#8211;d conjugation with nitrogen donor atoms, stabilizing C&#9552;N bonds and enabling highly reversible C&#9552;N/C&#9472;N transformations as the dominant redox process. This optimized coordination lowers the K&#8314; adsorption energy barrier by 44% compared to Co2&#8314; and Mn2&#8314;, markedly improving kinetics. As a result, Ni&#8208;BTA delivers a high reversible capacity of 452&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 99.2% retention over 500 cycles at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and maintains 292&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4,000 cycles at 1,000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a ligand&#8208;centered three&#8208;electron redox mechanism, where nitrogen heterocycles dominate K&#8314; storage and electrochemically inert Ni centers maintain structural integrity. This work establishes a general design principle for KIB anodes via d&#8208;orbital engineering in coordination polymers.

         <title>Non&#8208;Drying Hydrogel Polyelectrolytes via Polymer&#8208;Assisted Cation Solvation&#8208;Confinement Toward H2O for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>

A polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is reported to create non&#8208;drying poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) polyelectrolytes, enabling aqueous symmetric micro&#8208;supercapacitors with a record&#8208;breaking 2.5&#160;V voltage and unprecedented areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogel electrolytes often encounter challenges such as poor water retention and a limited electrochemical window due to inadequate control over water molecules, leading to a low operational voltage and an undesirable low energy density of pure aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs). Herein, a polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is presented to enhance both water retention and the electrochemical window of poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PAM&#8208;HPA) polyelectrolytes. Remarkably, PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes, without any organic additives, exhibit no water evaporation after over 3.5 months of air exposure at room temperature. Owing to the strong confinement toward H2O in PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolyte, activated carbon&#8208;based aqueous symmetric MSCs achieve a record&#8208;breaking voltage of 2.5&#160;V and the highest areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2 among all reported pure aqueous carbon&#8208;based MSCs. Even coupling with low&#8208;voltage MXene&#8208;based microelectrodes, the microdevice still maintains a high voltage exceeding 2&#160;V, a significant areal energy density, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life. Impressively, after exposing PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes to an oven at 60&#160;&#176;C for 24 h, the constructed MSCs retain nearly 90% of their capacitance compared to non&#8208;heat&#8208;treated polyelectrolytes. This work introduces a novel approach for developing non&#8208;drying polyelectrolytes with a wide electrochemical window, boosting the development of high&#8208;performance and safe micro&#8208;power sources.

         <title>Harnessing Rapid Li+/H&#948;+ Exchange within the Electric Double Layer for High Performance Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and lithium &#8208; ions (Li+) exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive coordination with the solvent oxygen sites. The electric double layer&#8208;governed Li+/H&#948;+ exchange substantially promotes interfacial Li&#8314; de&#8208;solvation to suppress graphite exfoliation and contributes to an expanded oxidation stability window of the electrolyte.








Abstract
The electric double layer (EDL) plays a pivotal role in governing interfacial composition and electrode behavior in electrochemical systems. However, the intricate relationship between EDL architectures and electrochemical processes remains elusive. Here the fundamental significance of hydrogen bond polarity within the EDL in orchestrating the interfacial lithium&#8208;ions (Li+) exchange dynamics is elucidated. At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and Li+ ions exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive effect for the solvent oxygen sites, which modulates the de&#8208;solvation process and ultimately impacts battery performance. Based on this, a solvent&#8208;centered de&#8208;solvation mechanism is proposed, wherein the microenvironment with enhanced hydrogen polarity in the EDL facilitates solvent displacement from Li+ coordination shells. Furthermore, the presence of polar hydrogen at charged cathode interface can effectively anchor uncoordinated solvents molecules, increasing the energy barrier for detrimental dehydrogenation reaction. As a result, electrolytes design based on this strategy enables remarkable electrochemical stability, achieving over 2000 cycles in a 5&#160;V dual&#8208;ion battery. In addition, the Gr||NCM811 pouch cell exhibits exceptional longevity, retaining 90.2% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Glass Composite Fiber for Broadband NIR&#8208;II Mini Light Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2+ activated glass composites and corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared by rational control of nanocrystallization, achieving efficient broadband response and on&#8208;off gain in NIR&#8208;II region. In addition, an all&#8208;fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is further constructed and demonstrated its promising applications for NIR&#8208;II imaging.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared second window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) light sources present remarkable scientific and technological promise, with wide&#8208;ranging applications spanning biomedical imaging, biosensing, and related fields. However, most of the available candidates are in bulk form and it is urgently required to develop mini light sources.

&lt;p&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated glass composites and corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared by rational control of nanocrystallization, achieving efficient broadband response and on-off gain in NIR-II region. In addition, an all-fiber mini light source by fusing glass composite fibers with commercial passive fibers is further constructed and demonstrated its promising applications for NIR-II imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared second window (NIR-II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) light sources present remarkable scientific and technological promise, with wide-ranging applications spanning biomedical imaging, biosensing, and related fields. However, most of the available candidates are in bulk form and it is urgently required to develop mini light sources. Herein, a broadband NIR-II mini fiber-type light source equipped by Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated glass composite fibers is proposed and investigated. It is shown that the transparent glass composite exhibits broadband NIR-II emission with a full width half-maximum approaching 240 nm and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) larger than 50% by rational control of nanocrystallization. Additionally, the corresponding glass composite fibers are prepared, demonstrating&#160;efficient broadband response and distinct on-off gain in NIR-II region.

         <title>Stretchable, Adhesive, Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel Electrolytes with Dual&#8208;Functional Water Regulation Enabled by Amide Group&#8211;Salt&#8211;Water Interactions for All&#8208;Climate Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is constructed via a one&#8208;pot strategy, integrating acetate anions and the hydrophilic amide groups on polyacrylamide chains. This design disrupts the intrinsic water hydrogen&#8208;bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries to operate over a broad temperature range spanning from &#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and environmental compatibility. However, parasitic reactions induced by active water molecules in conventional aqueous electrolytes severely degrade electrochemical performance and cycling stability. Herein, a stretchable, adhesive, anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte with dual&#8208;functional water regulation is synthesized via a one&#8208;pot radical polymerization strategy, where acetate (Ac&#8722;) anions and hydrophilic amide (&#9472;CONH2) groups on polyacrylamide (PAM) chains synergistically regulate water activity. This design disrupts water's intrinsic hydrogen bond network and suppresses interfacial side reactions, enabling stable AZIBs operation across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). Consequently, Zn||Cu cells employing PAM&#8208;Zn(Ac)2&#8208;4KAc (denoted PAM&#8208;ZnK4Ac) hydrogel electrolyte achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 500 cycles, demonstrating outstanding reversibility. Meanwhile, Zn||polyaniline (PANI) cells retain 81.4% capacity after 1100 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C and operate effectively up to 100 &#176;C. This work establishes a facile yet effective strategy for preparing hydrogel electrolytes, advancing all&#8208;climate AZIBs toward extreme&#8208;environment energy storage and flexible electronics.

         <title>A Hydro&#8208;Expansive and Degradable Biomaterial Enabling Shape Recovery of Film&#8208;Based Devices in Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chitosan&#8208;based bio&#8208;composite exhibits stable and strong tensile strength during volumetric expansion in body fluids, serving as a functional coating that enables a thin film&#8208;based device to self&#8208;flatten from its tubular shape required for catheter delivery. The material naturally degrades after deployment, demonstrating a promising strategy for the minimally invasive implantation of flexible, film&#8208;based medical devices.








Abstract
Hygroscopic actuation is an important material function, which enables a broad range of applications such as self&#8208;healing devices, soft robotics, and catheter implantation. With the current paradigm of implantable devices shifting toward soft and tissue&#8208;mimicking systems, this function however, is particularly weak in soft&#8208; and bio&#8208;materials due to the rapid loss of intermolecular interactions upon water incorporation. Here, a chitosan&#8208;based bio&#8208;composite is developed, which sustains the intermolecular repulsive force during water absorption through synergistic effects of hydrogen bonding, plasticization, and nano&#8208;confinement. When interact with body fluids, this material provides a stable and strong tensile force throughout its volume expansion process. Therefore, it serves as a functional coating that self&#8208;flattens a thin film&#8208;based device which holds a tubular shape needed for catheter delivery, and then degrades naturally. This capability is further demonstrated in vivo using a rolled triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for intracardiac implantation. The TENG device recovers its original shape after being placed inside the heart left ventricle and restores its regular energy harvesting function, evidencing the feasibility for minimally invasive implantation of flexible film&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Magnetocrystalline Anisotropic Platinum&#8211;Palladium&#8211;Iron Ternary Intermetallic Alloy for Enhanced Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, how crystallographic anisotropy governs the catalytic process is investigated by comparing the tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 ordered phases in a newly developed PtPdFe ternary intermetallic system. New insights into the fundamental understanding of the ordered Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic alloys are introduced, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis in fuel cells.








Abstract
Ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic alloys have emerged as promising candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in comparison to their disordered counterparts. Here, novel ferromagnetic PtPdFe ternary intermetallic alloys with structurally ordered tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 phases are presented, featuring distinctive characteristics in crystal structures and atomic alignments. Insights into the fundamental understanding of the Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic catalysts are provided, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for ORR catalysis. Electrochemical half&#8208; and single&#8208;cell assessments reveal that the L10&#8208;PtPdFe intermetallic catalysts exhibit superior ORR performance compared to their L12&#8208;type counterparts. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the unique tetragonal structure of L10&#8208;PtPdFe, characterized by strong 5d&#8211;3d orbital interactions along the c&#8208;axis direction, induces ferromagnetic ordering and leads to increased magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, thereby accelerating the ORR process. The fuel cell fabricated by such a cathode catalyst retains its performance after prolonged degradation test, meeting the 2025 stability goals set by the US Department of Energy under H2&#8211;O2, H2&#8211;air, and H2&#8211;N2 conditions. These new conceptual findings establish a rational framework for designing high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based intermetallic electrocatalysts, where magnetic anisotropy arising from ferromagnetic ordering can be harnessed to tailor catalytic performance for next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>High Ionic Seebeck Effect in Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a role of natural leaves as thermoelectric biomaterials, capable of converting heat into electricity through the ionic Seebeck effect. The leaves exhibit significant and reproducible thermopower under both moderate temperature gradients and photothermal conditions. These findings open avenues for developing eco&#8208;friendly energy conversion systems and biotechnologies based on in vivo thermoelectric assay.








Abstract
Plants actively transport ions to sustain life, yet their capacity to convert heat to electricity via the ionic Seebeck effect has remained unexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that natural Ficus elastica leaves can generate ionic thermovoltages up to 7 V under mild temperature gradients, achieving a high ionic figure of merit of &#8764;5.6 at room temperature. This pronounced thermoelectric response arises from anion thermodiffusion through the apoplast and is significantly amplified by leaf desiccation and electrode selection. A dielectric capacitive model accounts for the observed enhancement. Notably, living leaves generate thermopower under light&#8208;induced temperature gradients, underscoring the potential of in vivo ionic thermoelectric assays. These findings reveal an unrecognized energy&#8208;harvesting function in plant tissue and introduce a biodegradable platform for sustainable thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion.

Notably, living leaves generate thermopower under light-induced temperature gradients, underscoring the potential of in vivo ionic thermoelectric assays. These findings reveal an unrecognized energy-harvesting function in plant tissue and introduce a biodegradable platform for sustainable thermal-to-electrical energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Ultrathin Black Phosphorus Nanodisks Hybridized with Fe3O4 Nanoclusters and Iron (V)&#8208;Oxo Complex for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin black phosphorus nanodisks hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoclusters and iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex are rationally synthesized, and shown to exhibit ultrahigh stability in humid air, and competitive electrochemical potassium storage properties benefiting from unique structural and compositional merits.








Abstract
The practical&#160;application of metalloid black phosphorus (BP) based anodes for potassium ion batteries is mainly impeded by its instability in air and irreversible/sluggish potassium storage behaviors. Herein, a 2D composite is purposefully conceptualized, where ultrathin BP nanodisks with Fe3O4 nanoclusters are hybridized with Lewis acid iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex (FC) nanosheets (denoted as BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC). The introduced electron coordinate bridge between FC and BP, and hydrophobic surface of FC synergistically assure that BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC is ultrastable in humid air. With the purposeful structural and componential design, the resultant BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC anode is endowed with appealing electrochemical performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate behavior, and long&#8208;duration cycling stability in both half and full cells. Furthermore, the underlying formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms of BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC are tentatively proposed. The in&#8208;depth insights here will provide a crucial understanding in rational exploration of advanced anodes for next&#8208;generation PIBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Mn/Fe Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Electroreduction and Sustainable Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports adjacent N, P&#8208;coordinated Mn/Fe dual single&#8208;atom sites supported on hollow carbon polyhedron (MnFe&#8208;PNC) for superior ORR catalysis and the application of high&#8208;rate and wide&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;air batteries. The integration Fe&#8208;N3P with Mn&#8208;N3P coordination structures displays atomic distance&#8208;dependent electronic effects in optimizing the adsorption strength of *OH intermediate.








Abstract
Conquering the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significantly important for sustainable metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the synthesis of advanced Pt&#8208;free ORR electrocatalysts still remains challenging owing to the intrinsic activity, site accessibility, and structural stability. Herein, a catalyst of asymmetric N, P&#8208;coordinated Mn and Fe dual single atoms supported on hollow carbon polyhedra (MnFe&#8208;PNC) is synthesized via a metal&#8208;organic framework pyrolysis strategy, which displays excellent pH&#8208;universal ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.923&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m KOH, 0.803&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m HClO4, and 0.774&#160;V in 1&#160;m phosphate buffer solution. Theoretical calculations reveal that the distance&#8208;dependent electronic interaction between Mn&#8208;N3P and Fe&#8208;N3P structures at the atomic level plays a crucial role in optimizing the adsorption strength of *OH intermediate and consequently boosts ORR performance. Furthermore, the aqueous Zn/Al&#8208;air batteries using MnFe&#8208;PNC cathode catalyst show ultralong discharge stability and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. Meanwhile, combined with an anti&#8208;freezing and zincophilic organohydrogel electrolyte, the MnFe&#8208;PNC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries exhibit robust cycling stability (130&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 70&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), an unprecedented discharge capacity of 1.30 Ah at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, and smooth operation over a broad temperature range of &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Thrombin&#8208;Anchored Bacterial Cellulose Dressing for Advanced Burn Wound Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thrombin&#8208;anchored bacterial cellulose (T&#8208;BC) dressing is developed to address hemorrhage during burn surgery. By integrating a recombinant thrombin&#8211;cellulose&#8208;binding domain&#160;fusion protein into the BC matrix, the dressing achieves rapid hemostasis and enhanced wound healing. Validated in simulated deep partial&#8208;thickness burn models, this biocompatible material presents a promising therapeutic platform for advanced burn wound management.








Abstract
In burn wound surgery, commercially available dressings often lack the necessary hemostatic properties required to effectively manage hemorrhage during critical procedures, such as tangential excision of eschar. To address this limitation, a thrombin&#8208;anchored bacterial cellulose (T&#8208;BC) dressing is developed that combines the biocompatibility of bacterial cellulose (BC) with the hemostatic efficacy of a recombinant thrombin&#8208;cellulose binding domain (CBD) fusion protein. The CBD facilitates stable thrombin anchoring within the BC matrix, enhancing hemostasis, and promoting wound healing. The recombinant thrombin retains enzymatic activity comparable to human thrombin, enabling rapid hemostasis in rat liver models within 60 s. Extensive testing across cellular, blood, and rat models has substantiated the dressing's exceptional biocompatibility, potent bleeding control, and accelerated wound repair, particularly in deep partial&#8208;thickness burn wound models. By seamlessly integrating thrombin into the BC matrix, the T&#8208;BC dressing offers an innovative and effective solution for burn wound care, significantly improving both healing speed and clinical outcomes.

         <title>Transparent&#8208;To&#8208;Reflective Multicolor All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Next&#8208;Generation Intelligent Display Windows</title>

Based on the challenge that it is difficult to construct a resonant cavity in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices to achieve multiple color changes, a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode is utilized to realize multiple color changes in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device based on WO3, achieving a wide color gamut of up to 11.58%.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices have a wide range of industrial applications due to favorable chemical stability, high optical modulation rate, and good process compatibility. However, the monochromatic nature evidently restricts its development in transparent display, especially in application scenarios where color display is required. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state WO3&#8208;based electrochromic device is presented with a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode, which features a transparent&#8208;to&#8208;reflective switching mode. More importantly, through the optimization of optical interference, the device exhibits rainbow structural colors. Leveraging the tunable optical constants of the electrochromic layer in conjunction with the additive color mixing principle, a remarkably wide color gamut of up to 11.58% can be attained with merely a minimal bias voltage of &#177;1.5 V, which substantially broadens the color gamut boundary of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ECDs and represents a significant breakthrough in color&#8208;rendering capabilities. The device exhibits excellent electrochromic performance, remarkable cycling stability (at least 5600 cycles), low power consumption (3.8 mW cm&#8722;2). Moreover, this device has two different performance modes, namely transmittance and reflection, and it holds great application potential in fields such as advertising, information transmission, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Tuning Spin Polarization of Iron in Oxides to Boost Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic NRR for ammonia production offers potential energy savings and environmental benefits. However, most effective catalysts use expensive noble metals. This study explores how spin polarization in iron oxides influences NRR performance. it is found that iron in perovskite boosts ammonia yield by 79 times compared to Fe2O3, offering a promising path for sustainable ammonia production.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production has gained attention for its potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. However, effective NRR catalysts currently rely on expensive noble metals, the development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal alternatives remains highly challenging. Iron&#8208;based catalysts are underexplored because of their inherently low reactivity. In this study, it is found that tailoring spin polarization, specifically the occupation state of electronics on d orbital in iron oxides, can highly boost NRR performance with carefully designed spin polarization. Iron in perovskite SrFeO3 with higher spin polarization shows 79 times increase in ammonia yield compared to iron in Fe2O3. This improvement is accompanied with 9 times increase in charge transfer between iron and *NNH, the rate&#8208;determining step of NRR manipulating the spin polarization of transition metals can lead to efficient catalysts for electrochemical NRR, offering valuable insights for enhancing catalyst performance and enabling more sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Nanometer Resolution Structure&#8208;Emission Correlation of Individual Quantum Emitters via Enhanced Cathodoluminescence in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanometer&#8208;resolution mapping of individual quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride is achieved, allowing us to identify the 440&#160;nm blue emitter as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Leveraging this atomic&#8208;level insight, the deterministic creation of isolated single 440&#160;nm blue emitters is demonstrated through localized electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride.








Abstract
Understanding the atomic structure of quantum emitters, often originating from point defects or impuritie, is essential for designing and optimizing materials for quantum technologies such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Despite the availability of atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale cathodoluminescence microscopy, experimentally determining the atomic structure of individual emitters is challenging due to the conflicting needs for thick samples to generate strong cathodoluminescence signals and thin samples for structural analysis. To overcome this challenge, significantly enhanced cathodoluminescence at twisted interfaces is leveraged to achieve sub&#8208;nanometer localization precision for the first time in mapping individual quantum emitters in carbon&#8208;implanted hexagonal boron nitride. This unprecedent spatial sensitivity, together with correlative electron energy loss spectroscopy quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, and first principles density functional theory calculations, enables the identification of the atomic structure of the 440&#160;nm blue emitter in hexagonal boron nitride as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Building on the atomic structure insights, nanoscale spatially precise creation of blue emitters is demonstrated by electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride. This advancement in correlating atomic structures with optical properties lays the foundation for a deeper understanding and precise engineering of quantum emitters, significantly advancing the development of cutting&#8208;edge quantum information technologies.

         <title>Neuromorphic Light&#8208;Responsive Organic Matter for in Materia Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we show that light&#8208;responsive adaptive organic matter can store and process information at the matter level, and emulate neuromorphic functionalities such as short term memory, long term memory and visual memory. Besides demonstrating that material dynamics can be exploited for spatio&#8208;temporal event detection and motion perception, we show that these adaptive photo&#8208;responsive organic systems can be exploited for hardware implementation of physical reservoir computing.








Abstract
Materials able to sense and respond to external stimuli by adapting their internal state to process and store information, represent promising candidates for implementing neuromorphic functionalities and brain&#8208;inspired computing paradigms. In this context, neuromorphic systems based on light&#8208;responsive materials enable the use of light as information carrier, allowing to emulate basic functions of the human retina. In this work it is demonstrated that optically&#8208;induced molecular dynamics in azopolymers can be exploited for neuromorphic&#8208;type of data processing in the analog domain and for computing at the matter level (i.e., in materia). Besides showing that azopolymers can be exploited for data storage, it is demonstrated that the adaptiveness of these materials enables the implementation of synaptic functionalities including short&#8208;term memory, long&#8208;term memory, and visual memory. Results show that azopolymers allow event detection and motion perception, enabling physical implementation of information processing schemes requiring real&#8208;time analysis of spatio&#8208;temporal inputs. Furthermore, it is shown that light&#8208;induced dynamics can be exploited for the in materia implementation of the unconventional computing paradigm denoted as reservoir computing. This work underscores the potential of azopolymers as promising materials for developing adaptive, intelligent photo&#8208;responsive systems that mimic some of the complex processing abilities of biological systems.

         <title>Low Dielectric and High Thermal Conductive Phononic Crystal Nanofiber Metamaterial Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phononic crystal nanofiber film is fabricated via localized crystallization of polyimide (PI) induced by boron nitride nanosheets. The aligned crystalline domains form efficient phonon transport pathways (6.51 W/(m&#183;K)), while the amorphous PI surrounding the fibers hinders dipole alignment, yielding an ultralow dielectric constant (2.63). This structural engineering resolves the thermal&#8208;dielectric trade&#8208;off in 3D integrated circuit packaging.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of 3D heterogeneous integration technology has created stringent requirements for the thermal conductivity of low dielectric materials. However, common low dielectric materials generally have low thermal conductivity, which hinders the ability to simultaneously optimize signal transmission and heat dissipation in integrated systems. Here, a crystallization control strategy is proposed to tackle the challenge of balancing high thermal conductivity with a low dielectric constant. Through precise control of synthesis parameters, a phononic crystal nanofiber (NF) metamaterial film composed of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) and crystalline polyimide (PI) bridges has been successfully developed. The crystalline PI bridging structure and BNNS synergistically form a phononic crystal&#8208;like metamaterial inside the fiber, enhancing lattice vibration and facilitating heat transfer. Meanwhile, the PI around the fiber maintains a long&#8208;range disordered structure, hindering the arrangement of dipoles. The synergistic effect enables the phononic crystal NF film to achieve a high thermal conductivity of up to 6.51&#160;W/(m&#183;k) and a relatively low dielectric constant of 2.63, thereby enhancing the energy efficiency of 3D integrated systems.

         <title>Nanoconfinement of Ammonia Borane via Hybrid&#8208;Phased Titanate Nanocrystals Enables Sustained H2 Release for Diabetic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid phased titanates are leveraged to achieve nanoconfinement of ammonia borane (AB) via a distinctive one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This approach enables sustained H2 release while mitigating the detrimental reaction between AB and hydrogen peroxide in pathological conditions. The released H2, in synergy with magnesium ions, effectively promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration in a diabetic model.









Abstract
Despite its potential in hydrogen (H2) therapy, ammonia borane (AB) has limited biomedical applications due to its uncontrolled hydrolysis rate and potential to cause cytotoxicity. Existing material&#8208;based delivery strategies focus on accelerating AB hydrolysis for H2 production, hence exacerbating these issues. A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid&#8208;phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H2 release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H2 release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H2 release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes&#8208;related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg2+) synergistically promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration.

This approach enables sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release while mitigating the detrimental reaction between AB and hydrogen peroxide in pathological conditions. The released H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in synergy with magnesium ions, effectively promotes innervated-vascularized bone regeneration in a diabetic model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential in hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) therapy, ammonia borane (AB) has limited biomedical applications due to its uncontrolled hydrolysis rate and potential to cause cytotoxicity. Existing material-based delivery strategies focus on accelerating AB hydrolysis for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, hence exacerbating these issues. A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen-deficient, hybrid-phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one-end-anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes-related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) synergistically promotes innervated-vascularized bone regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Single Atom Alloys for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) that integrate the advantages of Single atom catalysts (SACs) and Single atom alloys (SAAs) are successfully fabricated via incorporating ultrathin Mo layer on the surface of Mo2C matrix, exhibiting superior catalytic activity toward HER.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) achieve 100% utilization of metal atoms and have versatile support effects, whereas single atom alloys (SAAs) with metallic bonds own the free&#8208;atom&#8208;like electronic structure. Herein, surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) are developed that integrate the advantages of SACs and SAAs via incorporating an ultrathin metallic layer during the synthetic process of SACs. It is shown that the Pt single atom preferentially coordinates with metallic Mo nanolayer, thereby forming a Pt1&#8208;MoL surface atom alloy on Mo2C (marked as Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs). Comprehensive spectroscopic and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo nanolayer in SSAAs not only functions as an electron buffer between Pt1 and Mo2C, leading to a free&#8208;atom&#8208;like d state at Pt1 sites and thereby balancing the adsorption and desorption of H, but also enhances the aggregation, adsorption, and activation of H2O. Consequently, the Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs exhibit superior alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance compared to Pt1/Mo2C SACs, achieving a low overpotential of 12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 17&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into the design of advanced single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Competitive Ion Coordination in Gel Polymer Electrolytes Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Strength and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) decouples ionic conductivity and mechanical strength via competitive coordination between succinonitrile and polymer, resolving their trade&#8208;off. Interpolymer H&#8208;bonding compresses GPE, inducing molecular aggregation that channels anions into Li+ solvation shells to stabilize anode interfaces. This enables pouch cells with energy density over 450 Wh kg&#8722;1, advancing lithium metal battery electrolyte design.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show great potential for lithium&#8208;metal batteries, but balancing high ionic conductivity with robust mechanical properties remains challenging. In this study, a competitive coordination strategy is proposed to address this issue by incorporating highly polar succinonitrile (SN) into a poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylamide) (PMAm) matrix. The strong Li+ affinity of SN enables effective displacement of lithium ions from polymer hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites, maintaining the polymer's structural integrity while enhancing mechanical strength. Additionally, the hydrogen bonding between polymer chains compresses the polymer matrix, inducing molecular aggregation that creates fast diffusion pathways for Li+ and promotes anion participation in the solvation shell, facilitating the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). As a result, the resulting PMAm&#8208;SN GPE exhibits excellent toughness (24.8&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (2.8 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and high Li+ transference number of 0.76. When paired with a LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode, the GPE demonstrates a 90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 4.3&#160;V. A practical 5 Ah Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell delivers 456&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density and demonstrates outstanding safety under thermal and mechanical abuse, showcasing the potential of this GPE for practical applications.

         <title>Revealing the Altermagnetism in Hematite via XMCD Imaging and Anomalous Hall Electrical Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines X&#8208;ray magnetic imaging and electrical transport to uncover the anomalous Hall effect in hematite, an insulating oxide exhibiting unconventional altermagnetic properties. Imaging reveals distinct magnetic domains linked to crystal symmetry, and angular&#8208;dependent transport measurements highlight unusual symmetry&#8208;driven conductivity behaviors. This comprehensive approach establishes hematite as a model altermagnetic material for spintronics research.








Abstract
Altermagnets are a class of magnetic materials that exhibit unconventional transport properties, such as an anomalous Hall effect (AHE), despite having compensated sublattice magnetic moments. In this study, fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3), is reported combining electrical transport with advanced X&#8208;ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. These measurements directly visualize the N&#233;el vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry&#8208;driven transport behavior. The transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific N&#233;el vector alignments. Supported by first&#8208;principles theoretical calculations, how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed AHE is explained. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic&#160;technologies.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Driven Stochasticity: Bi&#8208;Heterojunction Noise&#8208;Enhanced Negative Transconductance Transistor in Image Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work engineered a bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance (BHN&#8208;NTC) transistor using a half&#8208;PTCDI&#8208;C13 layer, achieving expanded and tunable noise characteristics. This advancement enables efficient multi&#8208;bit TRNGs for AI&#8208;driven image generation and enhances logic circuit applications.








Abstract
Reliable true&#8208;random number generator (TRNG) hardware demands amplified intrinsic noise and multi&#8208;bit entropy output, which are difficult to achieve in conventional single&#8208;device TRNG implementation. A bi&#8208;heterojunction noise&#8208;enhanced negative transconductance (BHN&#8208;NTC) transistor is presented, incorporating an asymmetric PTCDI&#8208;C13 layer into an NTC transistor. This design enhances electron injection, expanding the NTC region (19 &#8594; 27&#160;V) and increasing negative transconductance (&#8722;0.036 &#181;S at VGS = &#8722;11&#160;V &#8594; &#8722;0.073 &#181;S at VGS = &#8722;15&#160;V) by reducing the electron injection barrier (&#8776;2.13&#160;eV &#8594; &#8776;0.41&#160;eV). The bi&#8208;heterojunction configuration introduces a strong correlation between noises, including trapping/detrapping and generation/recombination processes. This property enables a threefold higher entropy throughput in TRNG, achieving a 3&#8208;bit output per sampling event. The BHN&#8208;NTC&#8208;driven TRNG leverages increased noise&#8208;induced entropy to generate more diverse latent vectors, mitigating mode collapse and enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;quality, realistic images. This significantly enhances StyleGAN2&#8208;based image generation, improving performance metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) (18.7 &#8594; 8.3), kernel inception distance (KID) (0.024 &#8594; 0.009), inception score (IS) (6.5 &#8594; 9.2), and multi&#8208;scale structural similarity (MS&#8208;SSIM) (0.43 &#8594; 0.21).

     alt="Heterojunction-Driven Stochasticity: Bi-Heterojunction Noise-Enhanced Negative Transconductance Transistor in Image Generation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work engineered a bi-heterojunction noise-enhanced negative transconductance (BHN-NTC) transistor using a half-PTCDI-C13 layer, achieving expanded and tunable noise characteristics. This advancement enables efficient multi-bit TRNGs for AI-driven image generation and enhances logic circuit applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable true-random number generator (TRNG) hardware demands amplified intrinsic noise and multi-bit entropy output, which are difficult to achieve in conventional single-device TRNG implementation. A bi-heterojunction noise-enhanced negative transconductance (BHN-NTC) transistor is presented, incorporating an asymmetric PTCDI-C13 layer into an NTC transistor. This design enhances electron injection, expanding the NTC region (19 &#8594; 27&#160;V) and increasing negative transconductance (&#8722;0.036 &#181;S at &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;11&#160;V &#8594; &#8722;0.073 &#181;S at &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;15&#160;V) by reducing the electron injection barrier (&#8776;2.13&#160;eV &#8594; &#8776;0.41&#160;eV). The bi-heterojunction configuration introduces a strong correlation between noises, including trapping/detrapping and generation/recombination processes. This property enables a threefold higher entropy throughput in TRNG, achieving a 3-bit output per sampling event. The BHN-NTC-driven TRNG leverages increased noise-induced entropy to generate more diverse latent vectors, mitigating mode collapse and enabling the synthesis of high-quality, realistic images. This significantly enhances StyleGAN2-based image generation, improving performance metrics such as Frechet inception distance (FID) (18.7 &#8594; 8.3), kernel inception distance (KID) (0.024 &#8594; 0.009), inception score (IS) (6.5 &#8594; 9.2), and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) (0.43 &#8594; 0.21). Consequently, the BHN-NTC transistor establishes a scalable stochastic noise platform, advancing applications in secure electronics and probabilistic stochastic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 1000 Wh Kg&#8722;1 Cathode Facilitated by In Situ Mineralized Electrolyte with Electron Potential Well for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ mineralized electrolyte with Prussian blue analog electron potential wells revolutionizes aqueous zinc batteries, enabling a 1000 Wh kg&#8722;1 cathode and dendrite&#8208;free anode. This design mediates rapid iodine&#8208;bromine redox reactions, achieves multi&#8208;electron transfer, and ensures stable cycling over 6000 cycles. The breakthrough offers a scalable pathway for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan zinc batteries.








Abstract
The practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZMBs) are hindered by challenges such as low energy density and limited cycle life, which stem from the one&#8208;electron transfer at the cathode and dendrite formation at the anode. Herein, inspired by the biomineralization phenomenon in nature, an in situ mineralized electrolyte (IME) containing Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as an electron potential well is designed. This in situ mineralization strategy promotes uniform, rapid, and reversible charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, enabling the Iodine (I&#8322;) cathode to achieve a specific capacity of 286.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1 A g&#8315;&#185; and an energy density of 330.8&#160;Wh kg&#8315;&#185;. Simultaneously, the potential well facilitates the in situ recovery of Zn dendrites into active Zn2&#8314; ions, ensuring stable Zn anode cycling with a practical areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8315;2 for 1500 h. Furthermore, the mediation of iodine&#8208;bromine chemistry enables highly reversible Br&#8304;/Br&#8315; and I&#8314;/I&#8304;/I&#8315; reactions, achieving an energy density of more than 1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Additionally, an enhanced energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1 and a high energy efficiency of 86.73% over 6000 cycles are achieved. In summary, the in situ mineralization of an electron potential well in electrolyte offers a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs.

         <title>Detachable and Reusable: Reinforced &#960;&#8208;Ion Film for Modular Synaptic Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), addressing the rapid degradation of organic semiconductor layers. By introducing a mesh support and utilizing a scalable solvent exchange method, the &#960;&#8208;ion film enhances detachability and stability. The resulting OECTs demonstrate superior performance and synaptic properties, paving the way for sustainable, modular electronic systems.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show significant promise for bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing applications due to their low operating voltage, biocompatibility, and ion&#8208;mediated charge transport. However, conventional OECTs with permanently fixed organic semiconductor (OSC) layers lack modularity and reusability for sustainable electronics with e&#8208;waste reduction. Here, a novel reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film OECT featuring a detachable and reusable OSC layer that creates a unified composite with dielectric and gate components, establishing a new paradigm for modular device architectures is proposed. Through solvent exchange and mesh&#8208;supported gelation, &#960;&#8208;ion film exhibits enhanced mechanical stability, detachability, and superior electrical performance. The OECTs demonstrate remarkable 35&#8208;day air stability, 50&#8208;day storage lifetime, and over 80% performance retention after 600 electrical cycles. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;ion film OECTs exhibit synaptic behavior with paired&#8208;pulse facilitation of 167% and long&#8208;term memory retention of 34% maintained synaptic current after 250 s. These characteristics enable reservoir computing applications with a 4&#8208;bit encoding scheme for image recognition, processing 16 &#215; 16 pixelated input patterns, demonstrating reliable state differentiation and stable signal retention. Even at lab&#8208;scale development, reinforced &#960;&#8208;ion film OECTs represent a promising eco&#8208;friendly platform for modular, reusable components in next&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing systems, aligning with electronic waste reduction policies by enabling component reuse.

A new silicate electrolyte and synthesized K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 is is developed which exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 via a rational vacancy design strategy. DFT calculations show that potassium ions diffuse on the ac plane. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are promising options for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety and abundance of potassium resources. However, solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are still in their infancy and the reported electrolyte materials are very limited, making the exploration of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and physical/electrochemical stability a major challenge. Here novel triclinic K3LnSi3O9 (Ln = Y and Gd) potassium&#8208;ion solid electrolyte is reported with low activation energy and high stability. A rational vacancy design strategy is adopted to synthesize K3&#8722;xGdPxSi3&#8722;xO9 and the result of DFT calculation shows that the diffusion pathways of potassium ions on the ac plane exhibit a fish scale&#8208;like network structure. Specifically, the K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 delivers a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a stable potassium stripping/plating (a long&#8208;life cycle over 2000&#160;h). As a result, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C (500 cycles, 95.9% capacity retention). These results would no doubt boost research for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Highly Deformable, Ion&#8208;Conductive Borohydride&#8208;Substituted Sulfide Electrolyte for Superior Performance at Low Stack Pressure</title>

LPSBH combines features of argyrodite and glass &#8208; ceramic, providing high deformability across the full molding pressure range. This facilitates the formation of high&#8208;quality solid&#8211;solid interfaces, enabling stable 1000&#8208;cycle performance at 25 &#176;C in laminated NCM/Graphite cells under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems that can replace conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Further enhancement in battery performance requires the formation of a stable physical interfacial contact between the active material (AM) in the electrode and the solid electrolyte (SE). However, reducing the resistance at the AM&#8211;SE interface remains a key challenge. This study focuses on Li3PS4&#8208;xLiBH4 (LPSBH), a sulfide&#8208;based SE with an argyrodite structure, synthesized by mechanical milling. Although LPSBH is known for its high ionic conductivity, its mechanical properties are not thoroughly examined. Here, the deformability of LPSBH is evaluated by demonstrating that it can be formed at low pressures to achieve high relative density. A quantitative evaluation of the AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact using symmetric cells demonstrates the formation of a good AM&#8211;SE interfacial contact within the electrode layer. A 13 mAh&#8208;class laminated cell with LPSBH stacked onto the negative electrode achieves 6C charging at 25 &#176;C&#160;under a low stacked pressure of 5&#160;MPa, along with significant cycle stability, which retains &#8776;70% capacity after 1000 cycles under 1C/1C conditions.

         <title>Organic Thermoluminescence Driven by Electron Back Transfer: Microsecond Explosive Emission to Persistent Multi&#8208;Hour Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thermoluminescent materials are developed using radical pairs for energy storage, controlled by transannular sulfur&#8208;oxygen interactions that drive a back electron transfer (BET) process. This results in tunable luminescence, from long afterglows to microsecond flash, depending on temperature. The materials exhibit stability under extreme conditions, such as maintaining luminescence in boiling water, making them ideal for applications like radiation detection and thermoluminescent afterglow imaging.








Abstract
Precise control over the release of light energy, distinct from conventional thermal energy management, poses significant challenges in luminescent technologies. This study pioneers organic above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoluminescent materials using radical pairs as energy storage centers (ESCs), enabling controlled light energy release from multi&#8208;hour afterglows to microsecond&#8208;scale explosive bursts, accelerating the energy release rate by up to 1.8 &#215; 108 times. Notably, the unique transannular interactions between sulfur and oxygen in thianthrene oxides facilitate a thermally driven back electron transfer (BET) process based on radical pairs, central to the energy storage and release mechanism. Due to this BET process, these materials precisely modulate luminescence and exhibit robust stability, maintaining luminescence for 4 h in boiling water and storing energy in air for over six months. These findings advance organic thermoluminescence, highlight the significance of BET processes in various domains, and set new performance benchmarks for luminescent materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiferroic Liquids: Ferroelectric and Ferromagnetic Order in a Hybrid Nanoparticle&#8211;Liquid Crystal System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid fluid combining ferrimagnetic nanoplatelets and a ferroelectric nematic displays coexisting magnetization and polarisation at room temperature. This self&#8208;assembled multiferroic shows strong magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear optical response, offering a soft, reconfigurable platform for next&#8208;generation sensing, actuation, and photonic applications.








Abstract
Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self&#8208;assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, an example of a liquid is demonstrated that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director&#8208;mediated interactions drive the self&#8208;assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the coupling between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Conducting Elastomer with High Stretchability and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting elastomer, engineered via ionic liquid&#8208;modulated phase separation of PBFDO/TPU blends, achieves high conductivity (&gt;200&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;) and stretchability (&gt;200% strain). The first stretchable thermoelectric generator using n&#8208;/p&#8208;type elastomers demonstrates efficient energy harvesting, with robust performance in wearable applications under mechanical stress.








Abstract
Stretchable n&#8208;type conducting polymers are crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance optoelectronic and bioelectronic devices, yet their development lags significantly behind that of p&#8208;type counterparts due to the intrinsic challenge of harmonizing electrical conductivity with mechanical compliance. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to engineer a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conductive elastomer by synergistically blending the n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and modulating phase separation via the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. The resulting PBFDO/TPU/IL composites (PBTI) achieve an unprecedented combination of n&#8208;type electrical conductivity exceeding 200&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;, fracture elongation surpassing 200%, and robust operational stability, outperforming existing stretchable n&#8208;type conductive polymers. The controlled phase&#8208;segregated morphology ensures efficient charge transport while maintaining elastomeric resilience, addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between conductivity and stretchability. PBTI is integrated with a p&#8208;type PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based elastomer to demonstrate its versatility in constructing a stretchable thermoelectric generator (TEG), which exhibits a reliable power output under mechanical deformation. Further applications in fire safety warnings and real&#8208;time human physiological monitoring underscore the material's practicality in adaptive wearable and implantable systems. This work breaks new ground in n&#8208;type stretchable conductors, paving the way for sophisticated bioelectronics and self&#8208;powered devices requiring balanced electronic and mechanical functionalities.

         <title>Organic&#8210;Inorganic Multiscale Crosslinking Assembly for Ultrahigh&#8208;Toughness Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sodium alginate (SA) molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, progressing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk. The resulting organic&#8210;inorganic molecular interactions and highly integrated hierarchical ordered structure endow the nanocomposites with exceptional ultrahigh toughness, significantly outperforming conventional counterparts.








Abstract
Strength and toughness have traditionally been regarded as mutually exclusive, but simultaneously achieving both high strength and high toughness in organic&#8210;inorganic nanocomposites remains a significant challenge. Inspired by natural nacre and bone, inorganic ionic oligomers and organic molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, advancing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk nanocomposite materials. This process results in a highly integrated organic&#8210;inorganic hierarchical ordered structure, imparting exceptional record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh toughness (558.90&#160;&#177;&#160;34.84&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent tensile strength (353.84&#160;&#177;&#160;18.77&#160;MPa), and fracture energy (2.93&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2) to the nanocomposite films. The resulting bulk nanocomposite exhibits outstanding bending mechanical properties (a maximum bending stress of 207.17&#160;&#177;&#160;12.37&#160;MPa, and a bending energy of 37.62&#160;&#177;&#160;7.33&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 without fracture), exceptional fatigue resistance, and remarkable toughness in extreme environments (e.g., &#8722;196 and 200&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the nanocomposites can undergo hydrothermal&#8208;induced recycling and regeneration owing to their noncovalent crosslinking nature. Consequently, these nanocomposites exhibit significant potential for applications in high&#8208;performance structural engineering materials. The proposed organic&#8210;inorganic multiscale crosslinking assembly tactic based on inorganic ionic oligomers presents a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrahigh&#8208;toughness nanocomposites.

     alt="Organic&#8210;Inorganic Multiscale Crosslinking Assembly for Ultrahigh-Toughness Nanocomposites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sodium alginate (SA) molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, progressing from the ionic-molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk. The resulting organic&#8210;inorganic molecular interactions and highly integrated hierarchical ordered structure endow the nanocomposites with exceptional ultrahigh toughness, significantly outperforming conventional counterparts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength and toughness have traditionally been regarded as mutually exclusive, but simultaneously achieving both high strength and high toughness in organic&#8210;inorganic nanocomposites remains a significant challenge. Inspired by natural nacre and bone, inorganic ionic oligomers and organic molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, advancing from the ionic-molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk nanocomposite materials. This process results in a highly integrated organic&#8210;inorganic hierarchical ordered structure, imparting exceptional record-breaking ultrahigh toughness (558.90&#160;&#177;&#160;34.84&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent tensile strength (353.84&#160;&#177;&#160;18.77&#160;MPa), and fracture energy (2.93&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to the nanocomposite films. The resulting bulk nanocomposite exhibits outstanding bending mechanical properties (a maximum bending stress of 207.17&#160;&#177;&#160;12.37&#160;MPa, and a bending energy of 37.62&#160;&#177;&#160;7.33&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; without fracture), exceptional fatigue resistance, and remarkable toughness in extreme environments (e.g., &#8722;196 and 200&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the nanocomposites can undergo hydrothermal-induced recycling and regeneration owing to their noncovalent crosslinking nature. Consequently, these nanocomposites exhibit significant potential for applications in high-performance structural engineering materials. The proposed organic&#8210;inorganic multiscale crosslinking assembly tactic based on inorganic ionic oligomers presents a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrahigh-toughness nanocomposites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Effect of Mesoporous Metal Oxides Promotes Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxide electrocatalysts is demonstrated to lower the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and thus facilitate two&#8208;step tandem nitrate reduction electrocatalysis for selective ammonia electrosynthesis in a more sustainable manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) in water offers a sustainable alternative for robust electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) in ambient conditions. However, NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysis generally involves two&#8208;step tandem routes and suffers from sluggish hydrodeoxygenation kinetics, which result in a low ammonia selectivity and yield rate. In this work, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxides remarkably decreases the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and facilitates two&#8208;step tandem electrocatalysis of NO3&#8722;RR, which thus promotes selective NH3 electrosynthesis in an alkaline condition. By comparing a series of high&#8208;entropy mesoporous metal oxides and corresponding metal alloys and monometallic counterparts, high&#8208;entropy mesoporous (CoMnFeNiCu)3O4 discloses the highest electrocatalytic performance for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;RR, including remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.3%, high NH3 yield rate of 1.83 mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and excellent recycling stability of 20 cycles, representing one of the best electrocatalysts reported in the past three years. Moreover, cathode NO3&#8722;RR performance for selective NH3 electrosynthesis is enhanced when further coupled with the thermodynamically favorable benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction at the anode. It is expected that the high&#8208;entropy effect opens up a new route to design a library of novel tandem mesoporous metal electrocatalysts for the selective electrosynthesis of various valuable chemicals from wastewater.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Element Composition Modulation Strategy for Designing High&#8208;Capacity and Stable O3&#8208;Type Na&#8208;Layered Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;element composition modulation strategy is proposed for cathodes of NIBs, exemplified by LFANMT (NaLi0.05Fe0.04Al0.01Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.1O2), achieving over 180&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 4.3&#160;V. A stress&#8208;protective layer is constructed to alleviate the internal and external stress differences caused by uneven Na+ extraction during the O3&#8208;P3 phase transition. Cathodes exhibiting excellent cycling stability with negligible voltage decay under high voltage is successfully obtained.








Abstract
Unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes remain a substantial barrier to enhancing the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs). While the high&#8208;entropy strategy has demonstrated significant advantages in improving the performance of layered oxide cathodes, the specific capacities of reported high&#8208;entropy oxides remain relatively low (&lt;150&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). This prompts a reconsideration toward leveraging not just high entropy, but also the synergy among multiple elements to meet the demands for higher energy density. Herein, a multi&#8208;element composition modulation strategy is proposed to obtain cathodes without compromising on capacity, exemplified by LFANMT (NaLi0.05Fe0.04Al0.01Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.1O2), which achieves a remarkable specific capacity exceeding 180&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 4.3&#160;V. It is visualized that single&#8208;crystal particles with surface compressive stress and bulk tensile stress exhibit superior surface lattice oxygen stability and crack resistance during cycling. Constructing an initial stress&#8208;protective layer is beneficial for alleviating the internal and external stress differences caused by uneven Na+ extraction during the O3&#8208;P3 phase transition. Through precise elemental modulation, cathodes exhibiting excellent cycling stability with negligible voltage decay under high voltage are successfully obtained. The work provides an effective approach for designing high&#8208;capacity O3&#8208;type layered oxides for NIBs, emphasizing the importance of synergistic effects among elements.

         <title>How the Arrangement of Platinum Atoms on Ruthenium Nanoparticles Improves Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy for the formation of Pt islands and their transformation into Pt atomic strings on Ru nanoparticle surfaces is presented. The thermodynamically favored configuration of Pt strings on Ru catalyst is demonstrated to catalyze HER via the faster Volmer&#8211;Tafel pathway with a significantly improved intrinsic activity, owing to the well&#8208;aligned Pt&#8208;Ru sites adjacent to Pt&#8208;Pt sites.








Abstract
The platinum&#8208;ruthenium (PtRu) system is highly active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media with both Pt and Ru playing active roles in the water dissociation step that generates adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Precise control of the arrangement of Pt atoms on Ru nanoparticles can maximize the Pt&#8208;Ru sites for water dissociation and Pt&#8208;Pt sites for hydrogen production and can considerably improve HER catalytic performance. By directing the growth and distribution of Pt on Ru hourglass nanoparticles, the arrangement of Pt on Ru is controlled into forming Pt islands, small Pt clusters, and strings of a few Pt atoms. Calculations show that the unique atomic string arrangements of Pt on Ru is the thermodynamically favorable configuration. Additionally, these strings have a favorable combination of Pt&#8208;Ru and Pt&#8208;Pt sites, making the Pt&#8208;string on Ru the most active catalyst with a more than fivefold increase in turnover frequency for alkaline HER compared to the Pt&#8208;island on Ru catalyst. The results show how controlling the Pt atomic arrangement on Ru nanoparticle surfaces for the tuning of Pt&#8208;Pt and Pt&#8208;Ru neighboring sites can direct toward a more efficient HER mechanism and thereby significantly enhancing HER performance.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Entropy Garnet Electrolytes via Computational Screening for Stable Lithium Interfaces in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy stabilizes HE&#8208;LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments and compositional engineering. Through degradation mechanism exploration, lithium&#8208;compatible elements are selected, and unstable dopants (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) are excluded. A novel HE&#8208;LLZO (Li6.6La3Zr0.4Sn0.4Hf0.4Sc0.2Ta0.6O12) exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and stable cycling over 2,500 h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). High-entropy (HE) SSEs, leveraging multi-principal-element compositions, present a vast design space to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, the chemical complexity of HE SSEs introduces challenges in interfacial instability with lithium metal anodes due to the unavoidable inclusion of reactive elements. While conventional garnet-type SSEs are considered stable, it is revealed that five HE garnets (HE-LLZOs) undergo corrosion and partial dissolution upon lithium contact. Here, a rational design strategy is introduced to stabilize HE-LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments of interfacial reactivity with targeted compositional engineering. Through systematic exploration of element-specific degradation mechanisms, selection criteria for lithium-compatible principal elements are established. Guided by computational screening, unstable dopants are excluded (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) that drive interfacial degradation and synthesize a novel HE-LLZO (Li&lt;sub&gt;6.6&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) that exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cycling over 2,500 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the interfacial stability of Zr, Sn, and Ta while identifying Nb as a destabilizing element.

         <title>Sound, Force and Light Induced Emissions from Er3+&#8208;Mn2+ Doped ZnS/CaZnOS Heterostructure for Remote Temperature Monitoring via Photo&#8208; and Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Er3&#8314;/Mn2&#8314; co&#8208;doped ZnS/CaZnOS heterostructures are developed for remote temperature and force/sound sensing. The material exhibits UV/NIR photoluminescence, with energy transfer influencing color. Mechanoluminescence intensity is measured against applied power. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence enabled luminescence thermometry. Sound&#8208;induced mechanoluminescence, combined with thermometry, facilitated temperature detection during drilling and in heated systems. This demonstrates potential for excitation&#8208;light&#8208;free temperature probing.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) is a powerful phenomenon that enables light generation induced with mechanical or acoustic waves, and remote temperature sensing via luminescence thermometry techniques. In this work, the multi&#8208;functional, ML&#8208;active materials based on Er3+ and Mn2+ co&#8208;doped ZnS/CaZnOS heterostructure are developed for remote temperature monitoring and visual sensing of force and sound. The material exhibits characteristic photoluminescence (PL) under UV and NIR (up&#8208;conversion) excitation, with energy transfer from Er3+ to Mn2+ influencing the emission color. The effects of force&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion are studied in detail by measuring the ML intensity versus the applied power for Er3+ and Mn2+ emission in the single&#8208;doped and co&#8208;doped materials. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL is utilized to calibrate luminescence thermometry response, with Er3+ thermally&#8208;coupled levels and non&#8208;thermally&#8208;coupled levels of Er3+/Mn2+, providing temperature sensing capabilities. The unique combination of sound&#8208;induced ML with luminescence thermometry allowed optical temperature detection, alike during the drilling process, and in the externally heated system, using pulsed sonications. Whereas, applying continuous excitation, the sound&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion is studied and visualized using the developed ML&#8208;based optical thermometers. This approach demonstrates the excellent application potential of sound&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion for remote monitoring and, more importantly, for excitation&#8208;light&#8208;free temperature probing of different systems and working devices.

         <title>Supramolecular&#8208;Reinforced Hard&#8208;Phase Ionogels with Exceptional Mechanical Robustness and Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an echinoderm&#8208;inspired supramolecular ionogel is engineered with extreme robustness and damage tolerance via synergistic integration of hard&#8208;soft phase&#8208;separated architecture and multi&#8208;scale sacrificial bonding. The ionogel achieves advanced tensile strength, toughness, and unprecedented tear resistance, puncture energy, and high&#8208;speed impact resistance. Furthermore, a sensing matrix is developed that simultaneously accomplishes real&#8208;time limb motion tracking and precise damage localization.








Abstract
It is a formidable challenge to integrate superior damage tolerance into robust ionogels due to fundamental conflicts between covalent rigidity and dynamic energy dissipation. Herein, an echinoderm&#8208;inspired supramolecular ionogel is engineered with extreme robustness and damage tolerance via synergistic integration of hard&#8208;soft phase&#8208;separated architecture and multi&#8208;scale sacrificial bonding. The molecularly programmed hard segments of polyurethane integrate crystalline domains, high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which collectively enhance ionogel robustness, while a judiciously selected ionic liquid (IL) reinforced the hard phase via extensive IL&#8208;polymer multiple hydrogen bonds. The crystalline domains synergizing with reversible sacrificial bonds facilitated efficient energy dissipation through dynamic rupture/reformation mechanisms. Consequently, the supramolecular ionogel achieves advanced tensile strength (49.22&#160;MPa), elongation (1721.28%), toughness (424.09&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), Young's modulus (48.66&#160;MPa) and unprecedented damage tolerance, manifested as tear resistance (387.02&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, 59&#8208;fold that of polyurethane), outstanding puncture energy (1326.8 mJ), and exceptional high&#8208;speed impact resistance (228.74&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 at strain rate of 20&#160;000 s&#8722;1). Notably, the ionogel demonstrated autonomous room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing, broad operational temperature adaptability, flame retardancy, and recyclability. Furthermore, a wearable ionogel sensing matrix is developed to simultaneously accomplish real&#8208;time limb motion tracking and precise damage localization, targeting next&#8208;generation intelligent protective equipment to deliver integrated impact protection and flexible sensing.

         <title>Confining Quantum Dots Within Covalent Organic Framework Cages for Coupled CO2 Photoreduction and Value&#8208;Added Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 41, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D/0D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is constructed by spatially confining ZnSe quantum dots within covalent organic framework (COF) porous cages, enabling coupled CO2 photoreduction and value&#8208;added chemical synthesis. COF porous cages serve as nanoreactors, enriching reactant concentrations, and the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates charge separation. This synergistic integration of nanoconfinement and S&#8208;scheme charge modulation establishes an efficient and robust bifunctional platform.








Abstract
Coupling photocatalytic CO2 reduction with the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals represents a promising strategy to mitigate carbon emissions while maximizing solar energy utilization. Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive photocatalysts for such tandem reactions, owing to their size&#8208;tunable band structures, abundant surface&#8208;active sites, and strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. However, their implementation is often hindered by severe aggregation and sluggish mass transfer, which limit their photocatalytic performance. Herein, a spatially confined 3D/0D covalent organic framework (COF)/ZnSe QDs step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction photocatalyst is reported, prepared via an in situ encapsulation strategy, for concurrent CO2 photoreduction and organic transformation. The ZnSe QDs are immobilized within the nanoporous cages of the COF, forming a confined microenvironment that suppresses aggregation, enhances photostability, and promotes efficient mass transfer. As a result, the COF/ZnSe heterostructure achieves a CO generation rate of 128.3 &#181;mol g&#8315;1 h&#8315;1, while synchronously delivering 95.1% conversion of 1&#8208;phenylethanol to 1&#8208;phenylethanone under light irradiation. The hierarchical COF matrix acts as a nanoreactor, enriching local CO2 concentration within its porous network, while the rationally designed S&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates directional charge flow, ensuring robust redox selectivity. This work provides a generalizable strategy for designing advanced heterostructured photocatalysts for efficient bifunctional solar chemical conversions.

Flame&#8208;Crafted Luminescent Pigments
This artwork illustrates the synthesis of ultra&#8208;bright copper tetrasilicate (CTS) nanosheets via flame&#8208;spray pyrolysis, resulting in novel blue&#8208;colored pigments. Emitting in the NIR&#8208;II window with quantum yields up to 34%, these wavelength&#8208;tunable pigments enable high&#8208;speed, super&#8208;resolution bioimaging, visualizing brain microcirculation and tracking immune cells in vivo. More details can be found in article number 2503159 by Robert Ni&#223;ler, Inge K. Herrmann, and co&#8208;workers. Art by the team of INMYWORK Studio.

Smart Glass
In article number 2503367, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers developed electrochromic smart glasses with controllable color and polarization by employing &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (&#960;V&#8208;LCLCs). Through simple self&#8208;assembly and polymerization processes, they constructed uniaxially oriented hierarchical nanostructures exhibiting three stable redox states and polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance, demonstrating potential applications in privacy protection and information security technologies.

Aerodynamic Surface Dimpling
Static aerodynamic surfaces cannot adapt to dynamic wind profiles, limiting performance under variable operating conditions. In article number 2505817, Katia Bertoldi and co&#8208;workers introduce a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling textile metamaterial that tunes aerodynamic properties even when body&#8208;conformed. Wind&#8208;tunnel tests and simulations show drag modulation up to 20%. Active stretching enables optimal performance across variable speeds, opening transformative applications in wearables, aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering.

Long&#8208;Term Pain Management
In the Research Article DOI: (10.1002/adma.202503872), Daniel S. Kohane, Christopher B. Weldon, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the development (in vitro and in vivo) of an aptamer/liposome (Lipo&#8208;Apt) drug delivery system that incorporates both affinity&#8208;controlled and diffusion&#8208;controlled drug release mechanisms into a single vehicle, thus prolonging the duration of effect without resultant toxicity. In vivo, a single injection of tetrodotoxin at the sciatic nerve in rats provided prolonged local anesthesia lasting for about one week.

Enzymatic Metabolism Driven by Photonastic Movement in a Bioinspired Starfish Prototissue
In the article number 2502830, Pierangelo Gobbo and co&#8208;workers report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of the first starfish&#8208;like prototissue capable of photonastic movement and photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction. Such higher&#8208;order behaviors emerged from the interaction and collective coordinated responses that were enabled by the spatial integration of specialised protocell units within the prototissue. Applications include modular micro&#8208;bioreactors and soft actuators for biohybrid robotics.

It then reviews a range of photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the top cell, including well&#8208;established III&#8211;V compounds and emerging materials like perovskites and chalcogenides PV materials, which are currently used or have potential for use in constructing Si&#8208;based tandem cells. Additionally, the paper highlights the ongoing challenges faced by these top cells in Si&#8208;based tandem technology. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of different PV technological advancements and to identify strategic directions for future research that could lead to the development of highly efficient Si&#8208;based tandem PV systems.

By tailoring atomic&#8208;level active sites, SAMs effectively alleviate key issues such as volume expansion, dendrite growth, and capacity degradation. Their unique properties offer promising strategies for enhancing electrochemical performance, stability, and energy density in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom materials (SAMs) are a fascinating class of nanomaterials with exceptional catalytic properties, offering immense potential for energy storage and conversion. This work explores their advantages, challenges, and underlying mechanisms, providing valuable insights for rational design. By precisely controlling active sites, SAMs enable efficient charge and energy transfer, ultimately enhancing system performance. In applications such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, metal anodes, Li&#8211;S batteries, Na&#8211;S batteries, and metal&#8211;air batteries, SAMs effectively address key challenges, including volume change, dendrite formation, and capacity fading. Their unique electronic and structural properties also make them highly efficient electrocatalysts, demonstrating remarkable activity and selectivity in lithium polysulfide, oxygen reduction, and carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of SAMs in the energy storage field are discussed. With ongoing research and development, SAMs are poised to revolutionize the field, serving as foundational elements in the transition to sustainable and clean energy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels are increasingly recognized in energy harvesting and sensing for their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and outstanding thermoelectric performance. This review summarizes recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels for applications in low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting, thermal sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications, while highlighting current challenges and future optimization directions.








Abstract
Harvesting the low&#8208;grade heat energy from the environment and the human body remains an underutilized energy. Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels have garnered significant attention in the fields of energy harvesting and sensing due to their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and excellent thermoelectric performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels in application of temperature sensing and low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting. The narration begins with the introduction of the synthetic and natural polymer for i&#8208;TE gels. Then, various methods are discussed to enhance the mechanical performance (stretchability, self&#8208;healing, and mechanical durability) to satisfy the flexible device based on i&#8208;TE gels. Noticeably, this work emphatically summarizes the improvement methods of thermopower for i&#8208;TE gels, including the preparation of n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE gels and the bidirectional modulation of their thermopower. Finally, this work explores the diverse applications of i&#8208;TE gels, including low&#8208;grade heat harvesting, sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Causal Relationships for the Electrolyte and Interphase Designs During Lithium Metal Plating/Stripping Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main barriers to the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) should originate from the imperfect solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anode (LMA). This review comprehensively analyses and focuses on the causal relationship between the electrolyte and SEI design during the lithium plating/stripping process, and its content will provide inspiration for its practical application of high&#8208;energy LMBs and boost the enduring enthusiasm in this field.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal battery (LMB) is widely recognized as the game&#8208;changer for the currently commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, because of their high energy density when paired with many cathodes such as layered oxide cathode (500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), sulfur cathode (600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), and oxygen cathode (700&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). In addition to the energy&#8208;related application, the electrochemical Li metal plating/stripping process is also the core for Li&#8208;mediated ammonia synthesis, Li plasmon&#8208;based low&#8208;powered dynamic color display, and so on. However, the insufficient understanding of the electrochemical process of the Li metal plating/stripping process is still restraining the development of these research directions. Herein, key advances for the key properties of solid electrolyte interphase, electrolyte engineering, and the artificial solid electrode interphase of lithium metal anode are reviewed. Based on these contents, several key points for the practical application of LMBs, including electrolyte design, energy density, and safety, are outlooked.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication Methods of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods of metal halide perovskites, such as thermal evaporation, magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e&#8208;beam and atomic layer deposition, solid phase growth, and laser printing. It outlines the current state of knowledge and discusses key challenges and future research directions.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have ascended as a remarkable class of materials in recent years, demonstrating exceptional promise for application in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. The vast majority of research on these materials focuses on their processing from solution, which is relatively easily executed in laboratory settings, but its scalability for industrial mass production remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, its reliance on highly toxic solvents imposes limitations with respect to large&#8208;area fabrication and have a negative environmental impact. This review comprehensively explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods for metal halide perovskites, outlines the current challenges and opportunities, and provides a critical assessment of the technological readiness and future research directions. The development of robust and scalable solvent&#8208;free fabrication methodologies is essential to realizing the full potential of metal halide perovskites. We hope that this review will serve as a catalyst, inspiring and guiding researchers to explore new strategies for the solvent&#8208;free deposition of these remarkable materials, thereby expediting their integration into technological applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Scaffolds for Enhanced Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the development and use of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds in tissue engineering. Bioinspired phospholipid and glycocalyx coatings enhance anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;thrombogenic, and selective molecular recognition properties. Native cell membrane coatings further support cell&#8208;specific interactions, immune modulation, and reduced bacterial adhesion. Recent advances in skin, bone, neural, and vascular regeneration highlight their broad therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Cell membranes are emerging as valuable models for regulating scaffold&#8208;cell interactions in tissue engineering. Their unique structure and function provide an ideal template for creating biomimetic surfaces that support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This has led to the development of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds (CMCSs), a new class of biomaterials designed to mimic native cellular interfaces and improve therapeutic outcomes. This review begins with an overview of cell&#8211;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, highlighting their key roles in tissue remodeling and healing. It then introduces ECM&#8208;inspired coatings before focusing on CMCSs. A detailed analysis of scaffolds coated with specific membrane components or entire cell membranes is presented, with applications in skin and wound healing, bone regeneration, neural repair, and vascular grafts. Techniques for membrane extraction, surface functionalization, and preservation of membrane integrity and orientation are analyzed. CMCSs demonstrate advantages over traditional scaffolds, including improved homotypic cell attraction, immune modulation, and resistance to non&#8208;specific protein and bacterial adhesion. However, several challenges persist, such as standardizing membrane isolation methods, optimizing coating density, and evaluating the stability and reproducibility of coatings, especially when using hybrid membranes from multiple cell types. Overcoming these barriers could significantly advance scaffold technologies for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Hydrogels Emerging from Dynamic and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive behaviors in hydrogels often arise from dynamic or non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains. This review highlights self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogels formed through dynamic crosslinking motifs, discussing their underlying mechanisms and emergent applications across biomedical and engineering contexts.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive hydrogels undergo changes in their physical and chemical properties in response to mechanical stimuli such as strain, force, or shear stress. These responses are often mediated by dynamic or non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. Unlike covalent bonds, which confer desirable mechanical strength but result in static networks, dynamic crosslinking motifs introduce reversibility that enables mechanically actuatable behaviors such as self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning or &#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening. This review highlights these four distinct mechanoresponsive behaviors in dynamic hydrogels, examining their underlying mechanisms, characterization methods, and emerging applications, with a focus on the critical role of dynamic interactions in enabling their mechanoresponsive properties.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production via Small Molecules Electrooxidation&#8208;Assisted Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation&#8208;assisted hybrid electrochemical systems provide an appealing solution for achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. This review summarizes recent advances in such hybrid systems, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, bipolar hydrogen production, and electricity output. In addition, the remaining challenges and future prospects for hybrid energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production systems are discussed.








Abstract
To alleviate overdependence on traditional fossil resources, green hydrogen (H2) production from an electrochemical water splitting (EWS) system powered by renewable energy resources (i.e., tidal, wind, and solar energy) has garnered considerable attention for its environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the H2 production efficiency of the EWS system is restricted by the sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which inhibits its further large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, recent advances in the hybrid EWS systems that substitutes OER with the thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation reaction (SMEOR) to integrate with the hydrogen evolution reaction are reviewed. First, the catalytic mechanisms of electrocatalysts toward SMEOR, reactor configurations, and evaluation parameters are briefly summarized. Next, the advantages and characteristics of the hybrid systems of SMEOR integrated with hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction are highlighted and discussed in detail, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, production of value&#8208;added chemicals, bipolar H2 production, and electricity output. Subsequently, the optimization strategies for rationally engineering the catalysts of SMEOR are proposed. Last, the current obstacles and future expectations of the hybrid EWS systems are outlined. This review aims to stimulate the further evolution of green H2 production.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Light&#8208;Activated Gas Sensors: Insights, Advances, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

Light activation of gas sensors is a promising strategy for enabling power&#8208;efficient operation in next&#8208;generation smart devices, where a rational design of sensing layers can enhance light energy utilization. This review discusses design strategies for light&#8208;activated gas sensors, including doping&#8208;induced band structure tuning, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering, along with key factors in light&#8208;activated gas sensing.








Abstract
Light activation stands out as one of the most&#160;promising&#160;strategies for improving the energy efficiency of chemiresistive gas sensors, a crucial step toward their commercialization and integration with smart devices. Current designs of light&#8208;activated gas sensors have primarily focused on catalyst decoration and doping in various photoreactive substrates (e.g., semiconducting metal oxides, conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks, or transition metal dichalcogenides). These approaches aim to induce surface activation to varying extents rather than optimizing the material itself for efficient light&#8208;energy utilization. Consequently, advancing light&#8208;activated gas sensor technology requires a dual focus on enhancing gas response characteristics and maximizing the utilization of incident light energy. To this end, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photochemical mechanisms governing light&#8208;activated gas sensing, highlights key factors for performance optimization, and discusses the recent advancement in design strategies such as band structure tuning through doping, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering. This review concludes with insights on future research directions in material development, signal processing, and device integration, offering a comprehensive perspective on the practical advancements of light&#8208;activated gas sensing technology.

         <title>Crystal Orientation Engineering for Energy Storage and Conversion Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in crystal orientation engineering for energy materials. It discusses orientation&#8208;dependent properties, characterization methods, preparation strategies, and their applications in energy conversion and storage systems. It provides insights into how orientation control enables performance breakthroughs in energy&#8208;related applications and may guide future developments in this emerging field.








Abstract
Nanoscale material design&#160;is crucial to the development of efficient renewable energy and storage technologies. While conventional research paradigms have emphasized material morphology, crystal polymorphs, and defect engineering, recent years have witnessed an emerging research interest in crystal orientation engineering since it can exploit anisotropic material properties to significantly enhance&#160; emerging energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of engineering the crystal orientation of materials to improve various energy conversion and storage technologies is provided. First, we discuss the effect of crystal orientation on material properties, including electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, surface energy, surface electronic structure, atom/molecule adsorption ability, and ionic conductivity. Then, the techniques to characterize the crystal orientation, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy, are reviewed. After that, effective&#160;strategies to engineer crystal orientation using both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches are summarized. The advances in crystal orientation engineering in energy conversion (electrocatalysis, solar cells, and nanogenerators) and storage (metal anodes, non&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrode materials, and solid electrolytes) applications are subsequently discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the potential of crystal orientation engineering and its impact on emerging energy transition technologies are summarized.

         <title>Solvation Chemistry of Nonaqueous Electrolytes for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of solvation chemistry in Mg electrolytes. The established connection provides valuable guidance for designing next&#8208;generation Mg electrolytes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and abundant resource availability. However, the development of ideal electrolytes that enable reversible Mg plating/stripping and ensure electrode compatibility remains a significant bottleneck. Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing this challenge, highlighting the need for a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the complex nature of Mg electrolytes. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the advances in nonaqueous Mg electrolytes, with an emphasis on solvation chemistry that governs ion transport, redox kinetics, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. A systematic analysis of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships in Mg electrolytes. Furthermore, the key challenges and emerging research trends in Mg electrolytes are summarized. This work underscores the critical role of mastering solvation chemistry in optimizing RMB performance and provides principled guidance for rational, bottom&#8208;up Mg electrolyte design.

         <title>Biohybrid Microrobot Enteric&#8208;Coated Microcapsule for Oral Treatment of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative oral drug delivery system using piezoelectric BaTiO&#8323; nanoparticles on Enterobacter aerogenes microrobots encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microrobots can penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and target the colorectal tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor cell death through ultrasound&#8208;activated reactions while simultaneously promoting an immune response against tumors.








Abstract
The oral treatment of colorectal cancer is highly desirable due to its noninvasiveness and potential for localized drug action, yet it remains challenged by gastrointestinal barriers and limited intratumoral penetration. This study presents the first oral biohybrid microrobot system that integrates ultrasound&#8208;activated piezoelectric catalysis with bacterial therapy, achieving synergistic tumor targeting, reactive oxygen species generation, and immune activation. By leveraging Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) and BaTiO3 nanoparticles, this strategy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and metabolic remodeling. It utilizes BaTiO3 incorporated into EA (EA@BTO) microrobots, which are encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microcapsules, encapsulated in enteric microcapsules via photocurable 3D printing, protect during digestion, target tumors, penetrate mucus, and release gases. They thrive in anaerobic, acidic environments, enabling precise, responsive delivery within the intestinal tract. Once the microrobots reach the tumor, the BaTiO3 nanoparticles catalyze reduction and oxidation reactions upon ultrasound irradiation, leading to the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Notably, the consumption of lactic acid by BaTiO3 and EA alleviates the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the tumor. This promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby reducing the proportion of regulatory T cells and enhancing the population of effector T cells.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Bioprinting of Mini&#8208;Muscles with Self&#8208;Renewal Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the FLight biofabrication for engineering in vitro muscle constructs by photocrosslinking pristine collagen and fibrinogen using ruthenium. The resulting mini&#8208;muscles retain in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization and a Pax7&#8314; cell pool. Notably, these mini&#8208;muscles are self&#8208;renewable upon injury, and their regenerative capacity can be further enhanced by small molecules such as Repsox.









Abstract
The plasticity and regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle arise from quiescent stem cells activated upon overload, injury, or disease state. Developing in vitro muscle models to study these properties can advance muscle disease modeling and pre&#8208;clinical evaluation. Here, Filamented Light (FLight) bioprinting is leveraged as a high&#8208;throughput approach for producing mini&#8208;muscle tissues. Using paired box protein 7 (Pax7)&#8208;nGFP primary myoblasts, mini&#8208;muscles are bioprinted from pristine collagen&#8208;fibrinogen (ColFib). The FLight hydrogel consist of aligned microstructures which guide the formation of aligned myotubes. Mini&#8208;muscles demonstrates in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization, including multinucleated myotubes and a Pax7+ cell pool embedded in newly deposited laminin. Both spontaneous and electrically stimulated contractions are observed. ColFib matrix is promising for maintenance of the Pax7+ cell pool. Damage from cardiotoxin&#8208;induced injury of the mini&#8208;muscles led to a massive proliferation of Pax7+ cells and restoration of the contractile properties of myotubes. Notably, small molecules such as Repsox can enhance regeneration. FLight printed mini&#8208;muscles have potential for applications in muscle biology, exercise/atrophy, disease models, and drug screening.

         <title>Giant Flexoelectric&#8208;Like Response via Macroscopic Symmetry Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance flexoelectricity by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameters and device structure is proposed. The centrosymmetric piezoelectric bimorph cantilever exhibits a flexoelectric coefficient of 1.47 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1, and the mirror&#8208;symmetric one with spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes achieves a record&#8208;high value of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1. This strategy can guide the design of high&#8208;performance flexoelectric devices.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity is enabled by symmetry in all materials. However, flexoelectric material application is limited by the normally low charge density produced in bulk materials. In this study, a universal strategy involving a macroscopic symmetry design is proposed to enhance the flexoelectricity. Through theoretical derivation, flexoelectricity can be improved by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameter distribution (including the piezoelectric coefficients) and device structure. As a demonstration, typical piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers (PBCs; Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag) are constructed with the two PZT&#8208;5H layers arranged in &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (mirror symmetry) and &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (centrosymmetry), to design the macroscopic symmetry and thus to tune the flexoelectricity. The theoretical predictions and experimental results show that the tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC achieves a flexoelectric coefficient (1.47 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1), 20 times higher than that of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC (7 &#215; 104 nC m&#8722;1) and conventional piezoelectric cantilevers (Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag). Furthermore, by introducing spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes, the macroscopic symmetry of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC can be transformed from mirror to centrosymmetry, yielding a giant flexoelectric coefficient of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1. This strategy offers a dimension beyond traditional approaches for understanding and enhancing flexoelectricity, paving the way for its practical application.

         <title>Piezoelectric Injectable Anti&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel to Promote Endogenous Healing of Tendon Injuries</title>

Piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel promotes Achilles tendon healing, forming a barrier to prevent adhesion and inflammation, and accelerates repair via piezoelectricity, offering a new clinical treatment strategy.








Abstract
Achilles tendon rupture has become a common sports injury nowadays, but tendon repair is still is a challenge in the clinical practice. Tendon adhesion, which results from exogenous healing, is a crucial problem impairing tendon repair. Meanwhile, insufficient endogenous healing from the tendon stem cells, makes tendon repair even more difficult. Here, a piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (PE&#8208;IAH) is reported, which can simutaneously promote endogenous healing while inhibiting exogenous healing in the tendon repair process. The in vivo study reveals that the PE&#8208;IAH can form a physical barrier in situ at the tendon injury site, which reduces the inflammatory response and effectively prevents the tendon from adhering to surrounding tissue. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric short fibers incorporated in the hydrogel can evidently promotes the proliferation and differentiation of tendon stem cells due to piezoelectric effect under ultrasound excitation. Altogethter, the PE&#8208;IAH successfully accelerates the endogenous healing of tendon in addition to the anti&#8208;adhesion purpose, resulting in remarkably elevated tendon functions (Achilles Functional Index: &#8722;15.6 of PE&#8208;IAH versus &#8722;30.6 of injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (IAH), Day 14). This study provides a new strategy for advanced healing and functional recovery of Achilles tendon, which is promising to become a potential clinical treatment option.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Dislocated WO3 Photocathode Toward Efficient Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the photoexcitation properties of Li2O2, a strategy for constructing a Z&#8208;type heterojunction at the photocathode@Li2O2 interface is proposed for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. This Z&#8208;type heterojunction acts as a charge modulation channel for carrier dynamics within Li2O2 through photocathode modifications. By utilizing edge dislocation &#8208;WO3 as the photocathode, both high capacity and low overpotential are achieved.








Abstract
The operation of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 batteries critically depends on the highly reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode. However, the intrinsic insulating nature of Li2O2 fundamentally restricts reaction kinetics, posing a core challenge to practical applications. Here, it is demonstrate that the insulating properties of Li2O2 can be effectively improved by photoexcitation, attributed to the generation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers. It is inspired to develop photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries featuring Z&#8208;type photocathode@Li2O2 heterojunction, which serves as a charge modulation channel to regulate carrier dynamics through photocathode modifications. By employing edge&#8208;dislocated WO3 as the photocathode, sustained growth of Li2O2 films is observed with a thickness &gt;18&#160;&#181;m, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than typically reported values. Benefiting from the enhanced exciton dissociation of Li2O2 and improved oxidative capability of photocathode, the battery delivers an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 31&#160;800&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and a light&#8208;induced temperature of &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. In addition, a low polarization overpotential of 0.04&#160;V is achieved with high reversibility over 1&#160;000 h. The grasp of photoexcited Li2O2 within Li&#8208;O2 batteries can drive solutions beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Electric Field Induced High Performance Graphene/LiNbO3 Dynamic Diode Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 dynamic diode generator (DDG) demonstrated an ultra&#8208;high voltage output exceeding 41&#160;V, attributed to the coupling enhancement between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO&#8323; surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface, thus opening up a novel avenue for the efficient harvesting of environmental mechanical energy.








Abstract
Substantial endeavors have been dedicated to continuously harvesting mechanical energy from the environment, where dynamic semiconductor diode generators (DDGs) have recently been drawing significant attention as the miniature, portable in situ energy device. However, despite their unique advantages of direct&#8208;current output and high current density, the output voltage of DDG is usually less than 1 V, which needs to be further improved to satisfy the demands of practical applications. Therefore, this study proposes a vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG that is conducive to an ultra&#8208;high voltage output. The coupling enhancement effect arising from the synergy between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO3 surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface has been identified as a key factor in achieving an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage output of 41.3 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.53 &#181;A. The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG can effectively power an LED without the requirement of an external energy storage and conversion circuit. Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding stability, showing no evident performance attenuation after continuous operation exceeding 3 h. The graphene/LiNbO3 DDG has enhanced the feasibility of real&#8208;time energy supply for electronic components and paved the way for the efficient harvesting of mechanical energy from the environment.

         <title>Coexisting Multiple Charge Orders and Magnetism in the Kagome Superconductor LaRu3Si2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of two distinct charge orders and emergent magnetism is uncovered in the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2. A low&#8208;temperature (1/6,0,0) charge order below 80 K induces magnetoresistance, and field&#8208;driven magnetic response. An additional lower&#8208;temperature scale marks time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking and Hall sign reversal, highlighting LaRu3Si2's unique interplay of charge order with pronounced electronic responses, magnetism, and superconductivity. The calculations underscore the relevance of electronic correlations in this system.








Abstract
The Kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for hosting unconventional chiral charge orders at high temperatures. In the context of the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2, a room&#8208;temperature charge&#8208;ordered state with a propagation vector of (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) is previously reported. However, understanding the interplay between this charge order and superconductivity, particularly with respect to time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking, remains elusive. In this study, we employ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetotransport measurements, muon&#8208;spin rotation experiments, and first&#8208;principles calculations to investigate charge order and its electronic and magnetic responses in LaRu3Si2 across a wide temperature range, down to the superconducting state. These findings reveal the appearance of a charge order with a propagation vector of (16$\frac{1}{6}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K, which coexists with the previously identified room temperature primary charge order (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0). The primary charge&#8208;ordered state exhibits zero magnetoresistance. In contrast, the appearance of the secondary charge order at Tco, 2 is accompanied by a notable magnetoresistance response and a pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent Hall effect, which experiences a sign reversal, switching from positive to negative below T* &#8771; 35 K. Intriguingly, a significant enhancement is observed in the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble below T* &#8771; 35 K. Moreover, the muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a substantial increase upon the application of an external magnetic field below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K. These results highlight the coexistence of two distinct types of charge order and magnetism in LaRu3Si2 within the correlated Kagome lattice, along with superconductivity. This study sheds light on the intricate electronic and magnetic phenomena occurring in Kagome superconductors, providing valuable insights into their unique properties and potential&#160;applications.

         <title>Unlocking NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence in 2D Copper Tetrasilicate Nanosheets through Flame Spray Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis method is presented to synthesize ultra&#8208;bright CTS nanosheets with tunable NIR&#8208;II emission. Achieving quantum yields up to 34%, these materials support high&#8208;speed imaging and enable super&#8208;resolution in vivo applications such as transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking.









Abstract
Expanding fluorescence bioimaging into the second near&#8208;infrared spectrum (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) unlocks advanced possibilities for diagnostics and therapeutics, offering superior tissue penetration and resolution. 2D copper tetrasilicate (CTS) pigments (MCuSi4O10, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) are known for their brightness and stability, yet synthetic challenges have curbed their integration into bioimaging. Here, flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis (FSP) is introduced as a versatile and scalable synthesis approach to produce ultra&#8208;bright, metastable CTS nanosheets (NS) by annealing multi&#8208;element metal oxide nanoparticles into 2D crystals through calcination or laser irradiation. Group&#8208;II ion incorporation shifts emission into the NIR&#8208;II range, with Ba0.33Sr0.33Ca0.33CuSi4O10 peaking at 1007&#160;nm, while minor Mg&#8208;doping induces a hypsochromic shift and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The engineered CTS achieves quantum yields of up to 34%, supporting NS high&#8208;frame&#8208;rate imaging (&gt; 200 fps). These unique properties enable CTS&#8208;NS to serve as powerful contrast agents for super&#8208;resolution NIR bioimaging, demonstrated in vivo through transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking in mice using diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). This pioneering synthesis strategy unlocks wavelength&#8208;tunable NS for advanced NIR&#8208;II bioimaging applications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Viologen&#8208;Based Lyotropic Chromonic Liquid Crystal Reactive Mesogen: Uniaxial Orientation and Photopolymerization for Transmittance and Color Controllable Electrochromic Smart Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is used for the fabrication of polarization&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable optical device. The &#960;V&#8208;LCLC EC optical device has the potential for advancing optical applications.








Abstract
To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length of viologen, the &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation&#8208;radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear&#8208;coating and molecular self&#8208;assembly. Subsequent photopolymerization of the uniaxially oriented &#960;V&#8208;LCLC film significantly enhances its mechanical and chemical stability while enabling polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance and distinct color transitions. This newly developed &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM facilitates the fabrication of energy&#8208;efficient EC optical devices with tunable transmittance and multicolor modulation, and it is operable at a low voltage of 2.5 V.

&lt;p&gt;The newly synthesized &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended viologen-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is used for the fabrication of polarization-dependent and color-tunable optical device. The &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC EC optical device has the potential for advancing optical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended viologen-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugation length of viologen, the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation-radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear-coating and molecular self-assembly. Subsequent photopolymerization of the uniaxially oriented &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC film significantly enhances its mechanical and chemical stability while enabling polarization-dependent transmittance and distinct color transitions. This newly developed &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;V-LCLC RM facilitates the fabrication of energy-efficient EC optical devices with tunable transmittance and multicolor modulation, and it is operable at a low voltage of 2.5 V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Control of Liposomal Drug Release by Drug&#8211;Aptamer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an aptamer&#8208;enhanced liposomal drug release platform is developed that controls the release of various drugs through a mechanism involving both specific drug affinity and impedance of diffusion. As in vivo proof of principle, this platform provides prolonged local anesthesia for up to 6.6 d following a single dose of tetrodotoxin (TTX) injected at the sciatic nerve in rats.








Abstract
Conventional diffusion&#8208;controlled drug delivery systems (DDS) can have undesirable initial burst release, leading to potential systemic toxicity, and the rate of basal release can deplete content, shortening the duration of effect. Here, it is hypothesized that conventional drug delivery systems&#8212;using liposomes as an example&#8212;can be enhanced by incorporation of an aptamer that binds specifically to the encapsulated drug. Affinity of the aptamer to the drug within liposomes (Lipo&#8208;Apt) would slow release. It is demonstrated that this approach works with a range of relatively small and hydrophilic molecules, including tetrodotoxin (TTX), serotonin (Ser), and kanamycin (Kan). The in vivo utility of this system in providing prolonged local anesthesia with TTX injected at the sciatic nerve in rats is further demonstrated. A single injection of TTX&#8208;loaded Lipo&#8208;Apt results in 6.6 d of nerve blockade, a fourfold improvement over the duration achieved by liposomes without aptamers, and 26&#8208;fold over the aptamer&#8211;drug complex. In part, the improved efficacy of Lipo&#8208;Apt is also due to slower release reducing systemic toxicity, which allows delivery of larger drug doses. These studies demonstrate that Lipo&#8208;Apt is a promising approach to enhancing control of release of drugs by DDS, reducing toxicity and enhancing duration of effect.

         <title>A k Descriptor to Design of Current Collectors for Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study mathematically derives three key parameters, dielectric coefficient, interfacial concentration change, and ion mobility, critical to current collector design, and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Guided by these theoretical insights, this study experimentally develops a free&#8208;standing current collector that exhibits optimal plating/stripping performance and extended cycle life of 24&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free strategy enables exceptionally high energy density in rechargeable metal batteries, but the lack of theoretical frameworks impedes current collector design. Here, this study mathematically derives three critical parameters: dielectric coefficient (&#603;), ion mobility (&#181;_C), and the change of concentration (&#948;C_C), and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Experimentally, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based current collector is fabricated with minimized &#603;, enhanced &#948;C_C (nano/micro&#8208;Sb particles), and &#181;_C (sodium carboxymethylcellulose, CMC&#8208;Na). The optimized design achieves remarkable cycling stability&#8208;over 24 months at 0.25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and 12 months even at a high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2. The lowest k value aligns with half&#8208;cell tests, validating this theory. This work establishes a quantitative framework for designing high&#8208;efficiency anode&#8208;free sodium battery current collectors.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Green Solvent&#8208;Processed 2D Nanomaterials for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocross&#8208;linking strategy is proposed for the patterning and integration of scalable vertical van der Waals heterostructures such as field&#8208;effect transistors, logic gates, and memory devices composed of 2D nanomaterials by UV light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linker in isopropyl alcohol. To optimize the alcohol&#8208;based dispersion system, Hansen solubility parameter analysis is performed to identify a solvent capable of simultaneously stabilizing both the 2D nanomaterials and the cross&#8208;linker.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed 2D nanomaterials have emerged as key building blocks for the large&#8208;scale assembly of functional electronic devices. Solution processing enables the formation of electronically active percolated networks by leveraging van der Waals (vdW) interactions between individual 2D nanosheets. While effective vdW interactions are expected to minimize potential energy barriers and contact resistances between nanosheets, undesired residues from material synthesis or device fabrication processes may remain at the interface. In particular, the ideal solvent candidates for optimizing the stability of 2D dispersions are typically difficult to remove due to their high boiling points and exhibit environmental toxicity. Additionally, conventional patterning processes require multiple solvents, which can disrupt vdW interfaces and degrade device performance. To address these challenges, a comprehensive process that combines 2D dispersion preparation with a cross&#8208;linker&#8208;based direct photopatterning technique is developed using an eco&#8208;friendly green solvent. To enable this process, the stability of 2D nanomaterials and ultraviolet light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linkers is thoroughly analyzed using Hansen solubility parameters. The developed process successfully enables the preparation of stable dispersions of cross&#8208;linkers and 2D nanomaterials, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten diselenide, and hafnium disulfide, which can then be assembled via vdW interactions to create large&#8208;scale functional electronic devices.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Achieving Efficient Phosphorescent Carbon Nanodots in Aqueous Solution by Suppressing Triplet Electron Leakage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning reveals that increasing matrix thickness reduces triplet exciton leakage, establishing a data&#8208;guided design paradigm for water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent CNDs with ultrahigh efficiency. 








Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted synthesis has emerged as a prevalent strategy for the fabrication of solid&#8208;state phosphorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs), yet achieving efficient liquid&#8208;phase CND systems remains challenging due to complex underlying mechanisms. The knowledge gap poses a substantial barrier to translating phosphorescent CND systems between solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;phase configurations. Herein, the critical role of triplet electron leakage is elucidated in reducing the phosphorescent performance of CNDs and demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can be applied to suppress this leakage, achieving efficient phosphorescent CNDs in aqueous solution. By integrating experimental datasets from hundreds of systematically designed syntheses, an interpretable ML model capable of predicting and tuning phosphorescence lifetimes in CND systems is developed. The quantitative relationships between features and lifetimes using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are established, revealing an inverse correlation between matrix thickness and the probability of triplet electron leakage. Guided by the developed ML model, efficient phosphorescent CNDs are achieved in aqueous solution with an emission duration lifetime of exceeding10&#160;s and a phosphorescent quantum yield of over 10%. This study establishes a conceptual and methodological framework for engineering high&#8208;performance phosphorescent nanomaterials in liquid&#8208;phase systems.

         <title>Enhancing N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance via Blending Alkyl and Oligoglycol Functionalized Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending hydrophobic and hydrophilic n&#8208;type conjugated polymers in precise ratios enhances charge carrier mobility and dramatically improves organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance. This strategy demonstrates how molecular interactions and phase compatibility within polymer blends can be engineered to tune microstructure and transport properties, providing a versatile design approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECT materials.








Abstract
Compared to their p&#8208;type counterparts, n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) generally exhibit inferior stability, slower ion injection kinetics, and reduced sensitivity when used as the active layer in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next&#8208;generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, how blending two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance is investigated. Specifically, NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains, are examined. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the &#181;C* product declines sharply. The enhancement in &#181;C* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (&#181;), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) is used to visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in &#181;C*. Overall, this study highlights polymer blending as a promising strategy for improving the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Quantitatively Predicting Angle&#8208;Resolved Polarized Raman Intensity of Anisotropic Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops comprehensive methodologies to predict angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity profiles of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), spanning from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit. By considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference, the complex refractive indexes and intrinsic Raman tensors are determined, offering a robust framework for ARPR analysis of ALM flakes across various dielectric structures.








Abstract
Angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy provides insights into optical anisotropy and symmetry&#8208;related electron&#8211;photon/electron&#8211;phonon couplings of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs). However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (&#10878;20 nm) flakes and four&#8208;layer Td&#8208;WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically&#8208;thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in&#8208;plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, are derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer&#8208;dependent electronic&#160;properties.

A fast&#8208;charging graphite anode (C@MEG) with rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport and low interfacial resistance is demonstrated for Ah&#8208;level lithium&#8208;ion pouch batteries, offering high energy density, high power density, short charging time and long cycle life. This work provides valuable insights for the fast&#8208;charging applications of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exponential growth of electric vehicle industry necessitates to rapidly develop fast&#8208;charging technology for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the mainstream graphite anode encounters significant challenges in fast&#8208;charging scenarios, including capacity decay and shortened lifespan caused by the sluggish lithiation kinetics and unstable solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, the kilogram&#8208;level scalable production of ultrafast&#8208;charging anode (C@MEG) consisting of micro&#8208;expanded graphite coated by an ultrathin disordered carbon layer (5&#160;nm) is reported, which simultaneously compensates for the conventional limitation of internal lithium diffusion kinetics and reconfigures the external electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This uniqueness endows rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport, with minimized electrode polarization, enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior, and reduced interface impedance. At an ultrafast&#8208;charging rate of 10 C, this Li||C@MEG cell exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 157 mAh g&#8722;1, superior to pristine graphite (71 mAh g&#8722;1) and previously reported graphite anodes. Moreover, this assembled 1 Ah&#8208;level C@MEG||LiCoO2 pouch battery delivers remarkable fast&#8208;charging cyclability, showcasing 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under 3 A, together with high power density around 1500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 under 10 A, corresponding to a short charging time of only 4.2 min, demonstrative of applicability. This work presents a practical scalable fast&#8208;charging anode toward high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power and long&#8208;life batteries.

         <title>Terminations Determine Energy&#8208;Level Alignment of Perovskite Buried Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the widely&#8208;reported &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221; in perovskite field is disclosed as the varying combinations of perovskite terminations at the buried interface. The substrate influences the electronic structure of the perovskite through inducing electron&#8208;transfer within different perovskite slabs near the interface. These findings highlight the potential of termination engineering to enhance the performance of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221;, where the semiconduction type of perovskite changes according to that of the substrate is a widely&#8208;reported, but so far not fully understood phenomenon in the field of perovskite. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of probing and comprehending the electronic properties of perovskite buried interfaces. Here, through broadly investigating 20 buried interfaces formed between different perovskites and organic hole or electron transport materials (HTMs or ETMs), it is revealed that the substrate&#8208;effect originates from the distinct energy&#8208;level alignments at HTM or ETM substrates. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this difference stems from varying proportions of two perovskite terminations, which are determined by the interaction between substrates and perovskite crystals. With such mechanism, the semiconduction type of perovskite by controlling the proportion of surface terminations is successfully tuned. These findings provide new insights into optimizing device performance through termination engineering.

         <title>Anchoring Unimolecular Metal Chloride as a Sterically Active Site for Conformal Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated MnCl2N4 structure anchored on hard carbon tailors the electronic environment of single atoms to lower zinc nucleation barriers. Chloride&#8208;assisted Zn adsorption with Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and residual Zn enables reduced overpotential. The resulting Zn&#8211;carbon composite anode delivers enhanced cycling stability and electrochemical performance in full cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the practical application of zinc metal anodes is hindered by the challenge of uncontrollable zinc&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, axial&#8208;coordinated manganese single atoms, anchored by N, Cl co&#8208;coordinating on self&#8208;standing carbon nanofibers, are designed to guide uniform Zn deposition. The MnCl2N4 octahedral sites act as effective nucleation centers, significantly reducing the Zn adsorption energy of the carbon matrix, achieving a nucleation overpotential of 17&#160;mV. The strong interaction between Zn and MnCl2N4 sites stabilizes the initially adsorbed Zn2+ through John&#8208;Teller distortions, which in turn promotes subsequent zinc adsorption. In symmetric cells, the Mn&#8208;modified carbon nanofiber electrodes exhibit excellent cycling stability with a lifespan of 200 h under a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a full cell coupling a MnO2 cathode with a Mn&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber anode delivers outstanding cycling performance over 1400 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of axially coordinated single&#8208;atom metals in regulating zinc deposition, offering a pathway toward durable and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>GHz&#8208;Speed Wavefront Shaping Metasurface Modulators Enabled by Resonant Electro&#8208;Optic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces using a silicon&#8208;on&#8208;lithium niobate platform are presented, achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the high quality factor resonance of the Si nanobar. Using this resonant nanoantenna platform, a beamsplitting metasurface device is developed, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. This platform provides a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing devices.








Abstract
Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, optical efficiency, and tuning response. Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range are presented. The resonant electro&#8208;optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin&#8208;film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q &gt; 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free&#8208;space light. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonance of the nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. Absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with &#177;5 V applied voltage is demonstrated, and the modulation dependence on the resonance quality factor is shown. Additionally, the modulation bandwidth of these devices exceeds 800 MHz, and the electrode limitations on this bandwidth are studied. Finally, how this resonant antenna platform can enable wavefront shaping metasurfaces is shown. A beamsplitting metasurface device is demonstrated, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high&#8208;speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing&#160;devices.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Polarization&#8208;Sensitive O&#8208;Doped ZrTe3 Photodetector Induced by UV Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector based on UV&#8208;laser&#8208;treated ZrTe3 is constructed with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers. It operates from 355 nm to 1.43 mm without antenna integration, delivering a responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 and fast rise/fall times of 729ns/14.9 &#956;s$\umu{\rm s}$. The device exhibits long&#8208;term air stability, enabling room&#8208;temperature multidimensional detection across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation photodetectors demand multidimensional information perception, high responsivity, and low noise equivalent power across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range. Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on anisotropic low&#8208;dimensional materials offer a promising solution, yet inherent material properties impose severe performance trade&#8208;offs. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing an ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers, fabricated via UV laser treatment of semi&#8208;metallic ZrTe3. The results demonstrate that the ZrTe3 polarization photodetector achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral polarized light response from UV to terahertz (355 nm&#8211;1.43 mm) with antenna&#8208;free integration at room temperature. Notably, it exhibits a high responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 with rise/fall times of 729 ns/14.9 &#181;s at 532 nm. One&#8208;year&#8208;long photoresponse tests in air demonstrate stability for ultra&#8208;broadband ZrTe3 polarization detector (UBPD). This work highlights the transformative potential of ZrTe3 for future wide&#8208;spectrum polarization&#8208;sensitive&#160;applications.

         <title>Graphdiyne Production in a Flash: High&#8208;Yield Direct Synthesis by Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work creatively introduces an electron beam irradiation strategy that enables the deprotection&#8208;free synthesis of GDY directly from HEB&#8208;TMS under ambient conditions, achieving almost 100% yields within seconds&#8212;the shortest time reported to date, to the best of the&#160;knowledge. This ultrafast and efficient method significantly improves over traditional approaches, which often require hours or days of thermal treatment.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, holds immense potential for diverse applications but is severely constrained by relatively complex and time&#8208;intensive synthesis methods. Here, a novel electron beam irradiation strategy is reported that enables the ultrafast and scalable synthesis of GDY directly from its protected monomer, hexakis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS), under ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of the direct use of electron beam irradiation in carbon materials synthesis, achieving the shortest synthesis time for GDY from HEB&#8208;TMS reported to date. This unprecedented efficiency arises from the rapid in situ formation of copper acetylide intermediates, followed by electron&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage to generate alkynyl radicals that undergo efficient homo&#8208;coupling into GDY. Moreover, this flash approach enables the in situ formation of uniformly dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles on GDY, resulting in a composite with exceptional efficiency and stability for the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. By providing a green, scalable, and efficient synthetic route, this work not only marks a leap toward GDY production but also establishes a versatile platform for designing GDY&#8208;based catalysts, paving the way for broader applications and industrial&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Magnetically &#8220;Programming&#8221; Cobalt&#8208;Doped Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Localized Induction Heating: Triggering a Collective Effect of Magnetic Moment Alignment on Demand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates enhanced induction heating in cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide nanoparticles via specific pre&#8208;magnetization, induced by the pre&#8208;alignment of magnetic moments. By correlating Co content with magnetic properties, the research highlights how magnetic pre&#8208;programming enables localized, on&#8208;demand debonding in composites. These findings offer future applications in industrial recycling, emphasizing the potential of a switchable magnetic memory in advanced systems.








Abstract
Induction heating, a contactless and efficient method for generating heat via alternating magnetic fields (AMFs), has evolved from simple thermal applications to precise process control in fields like catalysis, self&#8208;healing, and debonding. Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) play a key role as heat mediators, with heating properties adjustable via composition, size, and interactions. However, spatially precise heat control remains challenging. Current strategies rely on external AMF adjustments or material modifications, but lack an inherent mechanism to predefine which particles or regions will be activated for induction heating, limiting applicability in structured materials or complex environments. Here, it is shown that pre&#8208;magnetizing cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide NPs with a static magnetic field irreversibly enhances their heating rates by up to a factor of 40. This process permanently alters their magnetic properties, enabling selective heating independent of AMF modulation. The extent of activation scales with cobalt content, introducing a material&#8208;intrinsic thermal switch. Furthermore, assembling these NPs into supraparticles facilitates integration into functional materials. By enabling spatially resolved and selective heat generation, this strategy advances the control of induction heating at the material level. It opens new possibilities for on&#8208;demand, pre&#8208;programmable, spatially resolved thermal activation in composite materials, smart adhesives, and targeted energy delivery in complex systems.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates enhanced induction heating in cobalt-doped iron oxide nanoparticles via specific pre-magnetization, induced by the pre-alignment of magnetic moments. By correlating Co content with magnetic properties, the research highlights how magnetic pre-programming enables localized, on-demand debonding in composites.

         <title>The Synergy Between In Situ Gradient Polymerization and Phase Separation Enables Practical Solid&#8208;State Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

A gradient&#8208;polymerized solid polymer electrolyte with petaloid phase separation is developed via in situ polymerization. It delivers high ionic conductivity (1.5 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;1) and excellent cathode compatibility, enabling high&#8208;performance full cells for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional safety property. However, most of the previously reported SPEs cannot well match with high&#8208;loading and high&#8208;voltage cathodes due to their low ionic conductivity and limited anodic stability. Herein, a SPE with superior compatibility with high&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich cathodes is generated by in situ gradient polymerization of a deep eutectic electrolyte. Besides, a polymerization&#8208;induced petaloid phase separation structure enhances interfacial ion transport, resulting in a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled high&#8208;loading (19.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM811||graphite full battery exhibites a high capacity retention of 85.3% after 200 cycles and outstanding rate performance (1 C). Industrial 1.2 Ah NCM811||SiOx pouch cell demonstrates unprecefented energy density of 382&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Moreover, this SPE also exhibits significantly enhanced safety characteristics, delaying the onset temperature of heat release from 157&#160;&#176;C to 266&#160;&#176;C and thermal runaway temperature from 198&#160;&#176;C to 312&#160;&#176;C. This study provides a general and practical avenue to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
While the interest in hydrogen photocatalysis from organic semiconductors is rapidly growing, there is a necessity to achieve hydrogen production without platinum (Pt), considering its price, availability and toxicity. In this work, this is demonstrated that high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiencies can be achieved without the use of Pt. A series of low&#8208;cost conjugated polymers are designed around the dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide (BTSO) unit, and self&#8208;assembled as nanoparticles in water via the nanoprecipitation technique. This is highlighted that how side chain engineering, nanoparticle morphology and pH influence the hydrogen evolution rate. Optoelectronic properties are improved through a Donor&#8208;Acceptor structure, resulting in an unprecedented hydrogen evolution reaction rate of 209&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of Pt. A clear correlation between high efficiencies and number of BTSO units within the polymer backbone can be established. The design rules pioneer the design of future organic materials is presented for a cost&#8208;efficient and sustainable hydrogen photocatalysis.

         <title>Topological Transformation of MXenes to Non&#8208;Van Der Waals Artificial Solids with Well&#8208;Defined Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is produced based on the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes by substitution with &#8208;S terminations and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal atoms. The resultant non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solids disclose a good structural stability, high catalytic activity, and superior adsorption capability toward iodine species, delivering good rate capabilities and cyclic stability in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (MXenes) have become an ideal platform to produce some derivatives with tunable chemical compositions and structures, possessing unique physical and chemical properties beyond their counterparts. Here, a well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is developed on the basis of the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes, which involves the substitution of &#8208;Cl with &#8208;S terminations to enlarge the interlayer spacing of MXenes and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, and Sn) atoms. After the topological transformation, the MXene layers are chemically bonded, showing a higher thermal stability up to 550&#160;&#176;C in air than that of MXenes. The resultant artificial solids with well&#8208;defined atomic metal layers exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity to I2/I&#8722; redox reaction and a strong adsorption capability toward iodine species. As a result, Zn&#8208;I2 batteries deliver a good rate performance of 104 mAh g&#8722;1 at 32 C and a long cycling stability of up to 2000 cycles at 8 C.

         <title>Ultrastrong Negative Thermal Expansion Compositionally Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative thermal expansion materials, crucial for crafting metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariance volume, face big challenges&#8212;need to not only maintain large negative thermal expansion over wide temperature range, but also harness strength and ductility. This work reports a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Ti compositionally complex alloy that meets these challenges, where nanoscale local chemical ordering dominates displacive transformation kinetics, giving rise to tunable macroscopic performances.








Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which are crucial for fabricating strong metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariant volumes, face significant challenges: they not only need to maintain a large thermal expansion over a wide temperature range but also need to harness strength and ductility for load&#8208;bearing applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which are crucial for fabricating strong metallic composites with temperature-invariant volumes, face significant challenges: they not only need to maintain a large thermal expansion over a wide temperature range but also need to harness strength and ductility for load-bearing applications. Unfortunately, most of these materials are brittle (compressive strength &amp;lt; 1&#160;GPa), while the few ductile materials available have a narrow temperature range and significant thermal hysteresis. Herein, a compositionally complex Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ti alloy is reported exhibiting an excellent combination of large NTE over a wide temperature range with narrow thermal hysteresis, high compressive strength, and modest ductility. This unusual set of properties stems from the unique microstructure of the alloy, in which the matrix phase enables a unique kinetically sluggish thermoelastic martensitic transformation with a pronounced volumetric change, while the mechanically hard secondary phases contribute to the strengthening effect.

         <title>Amorphizing Iron Molybdate as a High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Multiple Insertion Reactions in the Metastable Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphizing iron molybdate (a&#8208;FMO) with its transition mechanism and electrochemical performance are elaborately revealed. Unlocking both the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in metastable structure, a&#8208;FMO endows a high&#8208;capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1cathode (231.6 mAh g&#8722;1cathode+anode in the full&#8208;cell) at room temperature and the superior cycling resilience at low temperature (&#8722;30 &#176;C).








Abstract
The rising energy demand for electric vehicles and energy storage has revived interest in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, present LMBs still mainly rely on conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2) with limited reversible capacity (&#8776;150 to &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1cathode), necessitating the paradigm to achieve a new host with abundant Li+ accommodation sites. Herein, it is proposed a high&#8208;capacity amorphizing iron molybdate cathode a&#8208;Fe2(MoO4)3 (a&#8208;FMO), which can reversibly unlock Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in the metastable structure. Different from its parent crystal and stoichiometric oxides mixtures, a&#8208;FMO, with its inherent metastable structure, can not only augment the lithium storage capacities with fully activated redox centers, but also attenuate the lattice confinements for Li+ ion migration. Consequently, the in&#8208;situ generated a&#8208;FMO electrode exhibited a notable reversible capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 500 cycles. It endowed a specific energy density of 597 Wh kg&#8722;1 and all&#8208;climate adaptability over 60 to &#8208;40 &#176;C benefited from the amorphizing nature, as well as negligible capacity degradation when cycling at &#8208;30 &#176;C. The identification of local structure evolutions and multiple&#8208;redox activations in amorphizing materials broadens the scope for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode by Ion Flux Regulation and Micro&#8208;Corrosion Zone Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

The limited reversibility of Zn anodes remains a key challenge impeding the practical development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous strategies&#8212;such as solvation&#8208;regulating additives and water&#8208;blocking surface coatings&#8212;are explored, they often face inherent limitations. In this work, a novel additive, ZnABL, synthesized via keto&#8208;enol isomerization, is introduced. ZnABL exhibits strong adsorption on the zinc surface and function through dual mechanisms: regulating Zn ion flux and spatially isolating micro&#8208;corrosion zones to mitigate zinc anode corrosion, finally improving the Zn anode reversibility. The method introduced in this paper offers valuable insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are receiving continuous attention as candidates for the next generation batteries, but the poor reversibility of the Zn anode limits their further development. In recent years, researchers are obsessed with modifying the surface of the Zn anode and adjusting the solvation structure of Zn2+ to address these challenges. Here, we propose a novel strategy to improve the reversibility of the Zn anode by simultaneously regulating the Zn ion flux and dividing micro&#8208;corrosion zones on the Zn anode surface, thereby manipulating the deposition behavior of Zn2+ and relieving the corrosion of the Zn anode. This approach exploits the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (ABL) to develop a specifically designed additive: Zn2+ coordinated &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone complex (ZnABL). With this innovative additive, the Zn anodes show excellent reversibility: Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves a long cycle life of 7780&#160;h (&#8776;11 months). Furthermore, the Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;H2O near&#8208;ampere&#8208;hour pouch cell, featuring a high areal capacity of 7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2, achieved an energy density of 106.17&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and sustained more than 350 cycles. The success of ZnABL in modulating the Zn ion flux and compartmentalizing the micro&#8208;corrosion zone provides a novel option for the reversibility improvement of Zn anodes.

         <dc:description>
Using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, nonreciprocal spin&#8208;wave behavior is revealed in real space in Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, highlighting their functionality for magnonic logic circuits operating at GHz frequencies. Topological defects disrupt phase continuity while preserving nonreciprocity, demonstrating the potential of these domain walls as programmable magnonic waveguides for directed information flow.








Abstract
Spin wave nonreciprocity is crucial for signal processing in magnonic circuits. Domain walls (DWs) have been suggested as channels for nonreciprocal spin waves (magnons) with directional&#8208;dependent properties. However, the experimental investigations are challenging due to the low&#8208;damping magnetic material with DWs demanded and the nanoscale length scales involved. In this study, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) is used to examine coherently&#8208;excited magnons when propagating in hybrid N&#233;el&#8208;Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Well&#8208;ordered lattices of stripe domains and DWs are created through the integration of Cobalt nanowire arrays. Their width is measured to be &#948;DW = (60 &#177; 13) nm. Near 1 GHz magnons are detected with short wavelengths down to &#955; = (281 &#177; 44)&#160;nm which were&#160;channeled in the DWs. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM data revealed a nonreciprocal magnon band structure inside the DWs. Bloch points are identified which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different &#955; adjacent to these topological defects. These observations provide direct evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el DWs in PMA materials, serving as programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information&#160;flow.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolved Proton Management by Harnessing Merocyanine&#8208;Integrated Hydrogels as Regenerative Photoacid Matrices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merocyanine photoacids are covalently integrated into hydrophilic polymer networks to develop regenerative photoacid matrices with excellent pH&#8208;switching performance retention through multiple regeneration cycles. This gelation strategy not only overcomes inherent solubility limitations and enhances their alkaline tolerance of conventional PAGs, but also enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled, shape&#8208;dependent proton release kinetics governed by diffusion.








Abstract
Photomanipulation of the environmental pH plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction kinetics and engineering material functionalities. While conventional merocyanine photoacids offer pH modulability, their practical implementation is fundamentally constrained by aqueous dissolution and laborious regeneration. Here, a transformative strategy is reported through the covalent integration of merocyanine photoacids into hydrophilic polymer networks to construct regenerative photoacid matrices, which stably retain protons in the dark and spatiotemporally liberate them upon illumination. The photoacid matrix overcomes solubility constraints through adjustable merocyanine grafting density while simultaneously enhancing alkaline stability, thereby enabling shape&#8208;governed, diffusion&#8208;controlled proton release kinetics. The universality of this approach has been extensively verified in multiple polymer matrices with variable chemical compositions. Upon straightforward separation and acidic regeneration in the dark, the recovered matrices sustainably maintain robust photoactivated proton release capability. This not only enables programmable control over acid&#8211;base indicator discoloration but also guides hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of arylazopyrazole&#8208;based hydrogelators, yielding 3D supramolecular gel architectures with tailored complexity. Furthermore, spatially controlled directional proton liberation are established through synergistically addressing negative phototropic deformation within a low&#8208;density crosslinked photoacid matrix. This work creates a new paradigm for spatiotemporal pH manipulation in the development of autonomous materials through regenerative photoacid matrices.

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Magnetic Particle Imaging: Tailored Magnetic Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is developed to optimize the magnetic diameter of magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced magnetic particle imaging. The resultant Fe310P exhibits an eight&#8208;fold increase in MPI signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer. Subsequent functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes yields Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, enabling ultrasensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastases as small as 0.5&#160;mm in diameter.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a groundbreaking imaging technique hindered by suboptimal tracers, as current magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are primarily designed for magnetic resonance imaging and are not specifically tailored for the distinct physics of MPI. To address this issue, optimizing the magnetic diameter of MNPs is focused on, a pivotal parameter influenced by both physical size and magnetic disorder, yet underexplored in the development of MPI tracers. By employing a precise temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy, this study successfully modulates these parameters synergistically to create high&#8208;performance Fe310P with an optimal magnetic diameter, exhibiting an eight&#8208;fold increase in the MPI signal in vitro compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax. Further surface functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes expressing a prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting antibody fragment (gy&#8208;1) yields tumor&#8208;targeted Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, which enables the detection of as few as 800 tumor cells with a single scan, without the need for repeated acquisitions. Compared to VivoTrax, Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1 achieves a 330&#8208;fold enhancement in the MPI signal in vivo, which enables the sensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastasis with 0.5&#160;mm in diameter. This study provides valuable insights into the development of advanced MPI tracers, paving the way for broader biomedical applications of MPI.

         <title>Unveiling the Mutual Promotion Mechanism of Adjacent Vacancy Defects Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mutual promotion of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite, and further develops a passivation strategy to synchronously passivate perovskite defects using a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine. The PSCs with active areas of 0.08 and 1 cm2 achieve champion PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, retaining 93% efficiency after 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination.








Abstract
The perovskite defect evolution directly impacts the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the mutual promotion mechanism of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite is unveiled, which means the cation/anion vacancy induces the adjacent anion/cation vacancy through decreasing the formation energy. This mutual promotion mechanism provides an explanation for the dynamic evolution of defects, and emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously passivating of adjacent defects. Accordingly, a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine is utilized to passivate adjacent defects, considering its adjacent electron&#8208;rich N atom, which can chemically bond uncoordinated Pb, and the hydrazine group, which can anchor FA+ through hydrogen bonds. Besides, this 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine also optimizes the perovskite crystallization through accelerating nucleation and slowing crystal growth, demonstrated by the in situ photoluminescence spectra. The resulting inverted 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 PSCs obtain PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, respectively. Moreover, the Target device shows enhanced stability by maintaining 93% and 90% of the initial efficiency after operating 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination and being exposed to harsh thermal cycling for 150 times, respectively.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Ion&#8208;Conductive Polyampholyte Elastomers via Dimeric Ionic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new class of polyampholyte ionic elastomers balancing both high mechanical strength and ionic conductivity by utilizing a novel precipitation method to create ionic dimers. The resulting elastomers exhibited strong mechanical performance and excellent ion mobility, making them ideal for applications in flexible electronics, wearable devices, and energy storage systems, particularly solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The development of ionic materials with high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength is challenging. This study presents a novel synthetic strategy for the development of a mechanically robust and ionically conductive polyampholyte elastomer based on ionic dimers (IDs) with strong ionic bonds between imidazolium and sulfonate. Polymerization of ID monomers with a network that forms a cross&#8208;linking moiety results in a novel polyampholyte ID elastomer (IDE). The addition of lithium (Li) salts in the IDE substantially enhances the ionic conductivity up to 0.82&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a high Li+ transference number (tLi&#8314;) of 0.79. The mechanical properties of the IDE with Li salts are remarkable, with a tensile strength of 27.4&#160;MPa and a Young's modulus of 211&#160;MPa, outperforming previous polyampholyte elastomers. A resistive&#8208;type iontronic sensor using the IDE exhibited excellent sensitivity (gauge factor&#160;=&#160;2.92) and reliable cycle performance (&#8776;400 cycles) under repetitive stress. The IDE serves as a polymer electrolyte in a pouch&#8208;type full cell, showing stable capacity at a high current density of 1.0 C (corresponding to 4.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 0.2&#160;MPa). This synthetic strategy offers a new approach for designing ionic materials with high conductivity and mechanical strength.

An amorphous MOF&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) is developed through the polyanion strategy. Thanks to the ultrafast transport of monovalent ZnCl+ ion, the ZGBC achieves a high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a high ionic transference number of 0.873 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transport of high&#8208;valence ions is a huge challenge, such as the transport of divalent zinc ions. Herein, a polyanion strategy is proposed to decrease divalent Zn2+ to monovalent ZnCl+, realizing ultrafast ion transport in solid&#8208;state electrolyte. An amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (ZGB&#8208;MOF) is designed and constructed as the matrix for solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The ZGB&#8208;MOF matrix is obtained by the Zn2+/Ga3+ competitive coordination process, enriching O&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl polyanion clusters, nanopores and C&#9552;O/oxygen vacancies active sites. The polyanion property of Ga3+ and physical limiting domains of nanopores promote the formation of ZnCl+. Abundant C&#9552;O and oxygen vacancies provide more transport sites, decreasing transport energy barriers for ZnCl+ (only 0.12&#160;eV). Eventually, the obtained Zinc ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) achieves high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high transference number of 0.873. More importantly, the ZGBC electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window (up to 2.88&#160;V) and high charging voltage (2.4&#160;V), and achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn&#8208;metal and stabilization of cathode materials. Full cells with ZGBC electrolyte and zinc hexacyanoferrate cathode exhibit excellent cycling stability, with no capacity degradation after 5000 cycles. This discovery could trigger new waves of enthusiasm for exploring new ion transport mechanisms beyond divalent Zn2+ transport.

         <title>Alternating Interlayered Piezoelectric Self&#8208;Heterojunction Boosts Sono&#8208;Piezocatalytic Pyroptosis Oncotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An integrative alternating&#8208;layered piezoelectronic nano&#8208;architecture has debuted, markedly enhancing ultrasound&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency and electron&#8208;storage capacity via robust electron confinement and heterojunction&#8208;mediated charge separation. Demonstrating catalytic and piezoelectric superiority over 29 benchmark nanocatalysts, this approach elevates microregional bio&#8208;responsiveness by amplifying atomic&#8208;level piezocatalytic mechanisms. These findings not only bridge catalysis with biomedical applications but also hold substantial promises for renewable energy conversion, environmental remediation, and advanced electron&#8208;transfer technologies.








Abstract
Recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers is a major barrier hindering the effectiveness of piezocatalytic oncotherapy. Herein, ultrathin oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered self&#8208;heterojunction bismuth oxysilicate (Ov&#8208;BOS) nanosheets with alternating hetero&#8208;layered nanostructure are constructed for enhanced sono&#8208;piezocatalytic tumor therapy. Benefiting from its out&#8208;of&#8208;plane asymmetry, Ov&#8208;BOS features an exceptional electromechanical strain coefficient (d*33 = 203 pm/V), highlighting its outstanding capability as a piezoelectric heterojunction for energy conversion. Particularly, the oxygen vacancy engineering facilitates the spatial redistribution of bands across the alternating [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers in Ov&#8208;BOS, promoting effective charge separation and stratified charge storage, thereby further suppressing recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers in a manner analogous to heterojunctions. Leveraging this strategy, Ov&#8208;BOS demonstrates efficient reactive oxygen species production and exhibits superior peroxidase and catalase&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional piezoelectric nanocatalysts. Consequently, the enhanced radical generation induced the specific cancer&#8208;cell pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 mediated gasdermin E&#8208;dependent pathway. Therefore, the engineered interlayer self&#8208;heterojunction provides an efficient strategy for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance piezoelectric nanocatalysts.

         <title>Fibrous Pressure Sensor with Unique Resistance Increase under Partial Compression: Coaxial Wet&#8208;Spun TiO2/Graphene/Thermoplastic Polyurethane Multi&#8208;Wall Multifunctional Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TGTMW fibers are designed to show a sharp resistance increase under pressure, as the multi&#8208;wall structure in the transition region between compressed and uncompressed areas bends and forms microcracks. This design breaks the physical sensitivity limit of conventional fiber&#8208;shaped pressure sensors, which usually show resistance reduction under pressure and are constrained by their series structure under partial compression.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure&#8208;sensitive sensors are rare. Although fibers are widely used in strain sensors owing to their structural advantages, developing fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure sensors is challenging. This challenge arises because the fiber acts as a series circuit along its axis, requiring increased resistance in the compressed region for a significant signal. Coaxial wet&#8208;spinning is used to create a multi&#8208;walled fiber. The outer layer, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/TiO2 slurry, ensured a smooth surface, while the inner core, containing 4% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), is extruded at 20&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1. Unlike conventional resistance&#8208;increasing pressure sensors, TGTMW fiber shows rising resistance under compression due to microcracks in its multi&#8208;wall structure. Its pressure sensitivity is evaluated using various 3D&#8208;printed indenters and showcasing its excellent performance. This sensor has found promising applications in remote motion detection, press or slide differentiation through wavelet transforms applied to high&#8208;speed sensing data, and real&#8208;time signal acquisition from a multi&#8208;channel sensing array. Additionally, intuitive visualization software is developed for the sensing array application and implemented a CNN&#8208;based machine learning algorithm for data analysis. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of &#8776;99.6% for 12 different compression modes. This work is believed to propose a new mechanism and design for fiber&#8208;based pressure sensors.

         <title>Interfacial Coordination Engineering to Boost Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Economic Zr&#8208;Based Halide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a coordination&#8208;driven amorphization strategy is employed to construct oxide&#8208;halide composite electrolytes by integrating Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) into Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO). The resulting composite electrolyte delivers high ionic conductivity, improved oxidative stability, and excellent cycling performance in ASSLBs, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable route toward high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (HSEs) have seen rapid progress in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), offering favorable lithium&#8208;ion transport properties, broad electrochemical stability, and strong interfacial compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. However, developing HSEs that simultaneously offer high ionic conductivity and low cost remains a significant challenge. Most high&#8208;conductivity halides rely on expensive metal elements, whereas cost&#8208;effective Zr&#8208;based halides are limited by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In this study, a new composite electrolyte (LA/LZCO) is developed via an interfacial coordination reaction between Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP). The coordination between PO43&#8722; groups in LATP and Zr4+ in LZCO induces local structural disorder, promoting LZCO amorphization. As a result, the ionic conductivity of LA/LZCO composite electrolyte is enhanced by more than twofold compared to LZCO, reaching 2.81 mS cm&#8722;1, among one of the highest reported for Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes. When integrated into ASSLBs with NCM83125 cathodes, the composite electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability, with 92.4% and 87.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C under 4.25&#160;V. Even at an elevated cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, 85.1% capacity is retained after 380 cycles, highlighting the promise of this composite strategy for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLBs.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte with Long&#8208;Range Ordering and Compact Molecular Packing as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Efficient and Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of triphenylamine&#8208;based p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is designed and synthesized, exhibiting long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, which enables efficient hole transport and suppresses charge recombination. When employed as hole&#8208;transporting layer, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA delivered over 19% photovoltaic efficiency in rigid OSCs and demonstrated excellent mechanical durability in flexible devices.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) materials with a non&#8208;corrosive nature and good compatibility with flexible electrodes are highly desirable for advancing efficient and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) exhibit intriguing advantages as HTLs, such as tunable properties and excellent solution processability, but they suffer from poor charge&#8208;transporting properties, resulting in inferior performance to traditional HTLs. Herein, a series of pH&#8208;neutral CPEs are designed and synthesized that can form enhanced crystalline and highly ordered films. By tailoring trifluoromethyl substituents on the triphenylamine unit, TMPT&#8208;F exhibited exceptional long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, along with a crystalline coherence length of 2.56 nm and a laminar packing distance of 1.48 nm, ultimately yielding an unprecedented conductivity of 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S&#160;m&#8722;1 for the CPE&#8208;based HTL. The substantially enhanced charge&#8208;transporting property of the PMA&#8208;doped TMPT&#8208;F:PMA greatly suppressed the charge recombination in OSCs. The OSC modified by the TMPT&#8208;F:PMA HTL exhibited a PCE as high as 19.24%, which is superior to the PEDOT:PSS device. Moreover, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA showed excellent compatibility with flexible electrode, enabling a PCE of 16.52% for flexible OSC, and the device retained 83% of the initial PCE even after a 500&#8208;cycle bending at 5 mm radius.

         <title>Creep Localization Empowering High&#8208;Capacity Alloy Anodes for Durable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible In0.32Sn0.48Bi0.20 alloy anode with a titanium mesh having a high area moment of inertia is introduced. This approach effectively addresses electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation in ASSLBs under industrial conditions, enabling LiCoO2||Ti&#8208;InSnBi full&#8208;cells with exceptional energy densities exceeding 350 Wh kg&#8722;1, fast&#8208;charging capabilities up to 30.57 mA cm&#8722;2, and low stack pressures (3 MPa).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity alloy anodes (Si, Al, and Sn) promise critical materials for developing high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, their implementation remains fundamentally constrained by severe interfacial stress, large volume changes, and high stack pressures. Here, a novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy is proposed to address these intrinsic limitations by coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible (InSn4)0.37&#183;(InBi)0.63 alloy anode with a titanium mesh possessing a high area moment of inertia. The investigations reveal a synergistic interface stabilization mechanism: InSnBi undergoes adaptive creep to maintain ionic&#8208;electronic interpenetrating networks, while the titanium framework, through its flexural rigidity, redistributes localized stress and prevents heterogeneous stress concentrations from driving InSnBi creep toward the cathode. This hierarchical stress management mechanism ensures stable cycling by accommodating substantial volume fluctuations, thereby enabling ASSLBs to realize stable cycling at high loading (23.05 mAh cm&#8722;2) and low stack pressures (3&#160;MPa), respectively. Remarkably, the as&#8208;assembled LiCoO2||InSnBi full&#8208;cell with a capacity of 5.56 mAh cm&#8722;2 maintains a retention of 81.6% over 3000 cycles at a 2C rate. This work presents a new paradigm for addressing the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling degradation of ASSLBs, representing a milestone advancement for developing high&#8208;energy ASSLBs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficient Hot&#8208;Exciton Emission from Carbon Quantum Gear Rack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroluminescent LED fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission with good color purity, chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is aligned with the Rec. 2020 standard for the primary blue color.








Abstract
The quest for exemplary color purity, superior efficiency, and nontoxic deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence remains paramount for developing wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays. However, achieving a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y value below 0.05, an exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE), and a low&#8208;efficiency droop in deep&#8208;blue emitters presents a significant challenge. Here, the study reports a deep&#8208;blue emitting carbon quantum gear rack (DB&#8208;CQG) characterized by an emission wavelength of 406 nm and a high quantum yield of 80%. DB&#8208;CQG comprises nine benzene rings and four embedded nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods and exhibits a quasi&#8208;planar configuration that leads to hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state characteristics. Both experimental investigations and theoretical calculations revealed the activation of the reverse intersystem crossing channel between the high&#8208;lying triplet state and lowest excited singlet state in DB&#8208;CQG via hot&#8208;exciton mechanism. DB&#8208;CQG exhibits characteristic HLCT behavior with deep&#8208;blue emission owing to the partial overlap of holes and electrons, which is facilitated by the formation of nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods in the quasi&#8208;planar configuration. The electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibit a deep&#8208;blue color with chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is one of the highest reported efficiencies for solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue LEDs.

         <title>Spatial Control of Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Lithographic Applications in Liquid Crystal Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a strategy to spatially control supramolecular chirality by leveraging spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal materials. It is generated by periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains, stabilized by a polymer network. This approach enables precise defect engineering, tunable chirality, and functional applications in lithographic particle manipulation and reconfigurable microstructured surfaces.








Abstract
Precise spatial organization of enantiomeric domains within self&#8208;assembled materials remains a challenge despite advances in controlling supramolecular chirality. Here, it is presented a facile strategy for directing supramolecular chirality through spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal (LC) materials, generating periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains. An LC polymer network stabilizes zigzag line defects, preserving their spatial organization and mechanical integrity. Focused circular dichroism spectroscopy and computational simulations confirm the controlled enantiomeric distribution. It explores interfacial chiral interactions and shows how boundary regions between enantiomeric domains can manipulate microparticle position. Additionally, it is shown that kink density and orientation of the zigzag structure can be modulated by adjusting sample thickness, applied voltage, and electrode configurations, resulting in tunable periodicity and macroscopic direction. The findings provide a robust approach for fabricating chiral domains through soft&#8208;material&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Invoking Hybrid&#8208;Ion Correlation Electrochemistry to Enable Optimal Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach that combines phase&#8208;field simulations and thermodynamic calculations is proposed, capturing ionic correlations in electrolytes/electrodes to activate the ionic electrodeposition (left) and (de)intercalation (right) performances in a hybrid&#8208;ion battery. This offers a potent approach to exceed the energy density and cycle life benchmarks set by single&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
As a generation beyond conventional batteries based on mono&#8208;/poly&#8208;valent ions, hybrid&#8208;ion batteries (HIBs) offer more opportunities to build battery prototypes because they utilize the merits of multiple ions. However, the limited understanding of ionic correlations in these heterogeneous systems experimentally and theoretically brings a great challenge in exploring their performance limits. Here, an approach is proposed combining electrochemical phase&#8208;field simulation with thermodynamic calculation, where ionic correlation in the electrolyte and electrode is addressed using the linearized Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann equation embedded with Debye&#8208;H&#252;ckel theory and ion&#8208;occupied sub&#8208;lattice model, to invoke the ionic electrodeposition and (de)intercalation advantages. This approach is independent of specific HIB electrolytes or electrodes. A &#8220;Seesaw&#8208;Inhibition&#8221; mechanism is uncovered, operating under hybrid&#8208;ion concentration regulation to determine the electrodeposition morphology in three types of HIBs, and simultaneously predict a general ion competitive behavior during their intercalation. Following this, a prototype of Na3V2(PO4)3||1&#160;M NaTfO+1&#160;M Zn(TfO)2||Zn aqueous HIB is built, surpassing pure Zn&#8208;ion batteries by 32% in measured energy density (128.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exhibiting low capacity decay (0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles). The scalability of the approach for regulating hybrid&#8208;ion electrochemistry demonstrates its practical viability for designing HIBs.

         <title>Trace Dual&#8208;Crosslinkable Additives Enable Direct Microlithography for Enhanced Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning is crucial for advancing organic electronics, enabling miniaturization and high&#8208;density integration. A dual crosslinking strategy is developed using a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) in polybenzodifurandione (PBFDO). At trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%), PR enhances patterning precision (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) and electrical performance, yielding a 42% &#181;C* increase and improved device stability, offering scalable solutions for organic electronics.








Abstract
Similar to silicon&#8208;based electronics, the implementation of micro/nano&#8208;patterning to facilitate complex device architectures and high&#8208;density integration is crucial to the development of organic electronics. Among various patterning techniques, direct microlithography (DML) is highly applicable and extensively adopted in organic electronics, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, conventional DML often requires high crosslinker concentrations, leading to compromised electrical performance. To address this challenge, a novel strategy is developed that combines supramolecular and covalent interactions by incorporating a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) into poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO). The PR forms a hydrogen bonding network with PBFDO and undergoes UV&#8208;triggered covalent crosslinking among its molecules, providing solvent resistance even at trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%). This approach enables precise patterning of PBFDO with feature sizes below 1&#160;&#181;m while preserving high electrical performance. Notably, PR also serves as a performance enhancer, promoting molecular ordering and ionic conduction within PBFDO. OECTs fabricated with PR&#8208;crosslinked PBFDO exhibit about one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in ON/OFF ratio, a 42% increase in &#181;C* (reaching 2460&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), and elevated operational stability compared to pristine ones. This multifunctional crosslinker offers a scalable solution for high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;density organic electronics and opens new avenues for supramolecular chemistry applications in this field.

         <title>A Photonastic Prototissue Capable of Photo&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chemical Transduction</title>

Mimicking energy transduction in prototissue assemblies remains a challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this work, prototissues integrating protocells with photothermal gold nanoparticle proto&#8208;organelles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These prototissues exhibited light&#8208;controlled reversible contractions, programmable motions, and dynamic control of enzymatic metabolism by restricting substrate access, pioneering a route toward bioinspired materials with emergent energy transduction behaviors.








Abstract
Despite recent significant advances in the controlled assembly of protocell units into complex 3D architectures, the development of prototissues capable of mimicking the sophisticated energy transduction processes fundamental to living tissues remains a critical unmet challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here a synthetic approach is described to start addressing this challenge and report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of a photonastic prototissue endowed with photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction capabilities. For this, novel protocells enclosing photothermal transducing proto&#8208;organelles based on gold nanoparticles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These advanced protocell units are assembled into prototissues capable of light&#8208;induced reversible contractions and complex motions, which can be exploited to reversibly switch off a coordinated internalized enzyme metabolism by blocking the access of small substrate molecules. Overall, the work provides a synthetic pathway to constructing prototissues with sophisticated energy transduction mechanisms, enabling the rational design of emergent behaviors in synthetic materials and addressing critical challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and bioinspired materials engineering.

         <title>Standalone Integrated Magnonic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standalone (not requiring external bias magnetic field) and tunable magnonic device is reported with all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on silicon (total footprint of 100 &#215; 150&#160;&#181;m) and 3&#8211;8&#160;GHz frequency band. This is achieved by monolithic integration of a CoFeB conduit with RF antennas and an assembly of NiFe and SmCo micromagnets providing a tunable bias field.








Abstract
In the race toward &#8220;beyond 6G&#8221; telecommunication platforms, magnonics emerges as a promising solution. To date, however, the requirement for bulky external sources of the magnetic bias field necessary for spin wave propagation has constituted a significant bottleneck, impeding the integration of magnonic devices into RF systems. Here, the first demonstration is presented of a standalone and tunable magnonic device featuring all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on a silicon substrate, with a compact footprint of 100 &#215; 150 &#181;m2. The device consists of a CoFeB waveguide equipped with two radio frequency antennas, flanked by a symmetric configuration of magnetic flux concentrators and SmCo permanent micromagnets. By varying the distance D between the flux concentrators and the permanent magnets from 0 to 12&#160;&#181;m, the transverse bias field can be tuned from 20.5 to 11 mT, respectively. This variation directly modulates the dispersion relation of Damon&#8208;Eshbach spin wave modes in the CoFeB waveguide. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices, the spin wave frequency band ranges from 3 to 8&#160;GHz, with precise tuning of the phase shift up to 120&#160;deg at 6&#160;GHz. The operational frequency band can be easily pushed to higher frequencies through micromagnet engineering.

A dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS) is developed using silkworm cocoon ion gel and PU foam, enabling stepwise EDL formation and enhanced ion migration. This versatile strategy synergizes high/low&#8208;permittivity layers with porous architecture, adaptable to diverse material systems, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity and wide&#8208;range sensing. Coupled with machine learning, DLIPS realizes temperature/pressure dual&#8208;mode sensing and silent speech recognition.








Abstract
Iontronic pressure sensors are widely used in human motion monitoring and human&#8211;machine interactions owing to their high sensitivity, wide measurement range, and excellent resolution. However, conventional dielectric layer designs often involve complex fabrication processes, high costs, and limited performances. This paper proposes a novel sensor structure, the dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS), which integrates high&#8208; and low&#8208;permittivity layers. Validated using silkworm cocoon ion gel and open&#8208;cell polyurethane foam as dielectrics, the DLIPS exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (72548.7 kPa&#8722;1), a wide working pressure range (0.001&#8211;420 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit (0.832 Pa), and remarkable durability exceeding 5000 cycles. By leveraging the distinct responses of the capacitance and resistance to pressure and temperature, the sensor can simultaneously measure both parameters. A deep learning regression model is integrated to decouple the mixed temperature and pressure signals, enabling accurate identification. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity and capability to detect minute pressure fluctuations, the DLIPS exhibited strong potential for skin&#8208;mounted silent speech recognition systems, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 98.5%. Furthermore, the DLIPS provides a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for fabricating ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensors, underscoring its versatility in wearable technology applications.

         <title>Halogen Ion&#8208;Mediated Hydrothermal Synthesis of Diverse MXenes with Tailored Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen ion&#8208;mediated strategy is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures. NH4F etchant enables potential high&#8208;throughput synthesis of Mo2CTx, while NH4X &#8208;intercalant (X = Cl, Br, I) combinations facilitate large&#8208;scale production of hetero&#8208;Mo2CTx. This moderate hydrothermal strategy achieves precise structural control on a variety of MXenes and hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional physicochemical properties. Despite extensive studies, efficient methods for the production of MXenes with precise structural control still remain a challenge, thus hindering their potential in many specific applications. Herein, a halogen ion&#8208;mediated hydrothermal approach is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures, demonstrating its potential as a high&#8208;throughput synthesis strategy. As proof of concept, Mo2C can be synthesized on a gram scale by employing NH&#8324;F in the hydrothermal etching process of Mo2Ga2C. Subsequently, this approach is applied to various MXenes, including Ti3C2, V2C, and Nb4C3. Moreover, NH4X (X = Cl, Br, I) etchants combined with small&#8208;molecule intercalants enabled the targeted synthesis of MXene&#8208;based heterostructures, such as Mo2CTx@MoS2 featuring &#8776;15&#160;nm amorphous MoS2 surface layers. Notable, the Mo2CTx(Br) heterostructure exhibited outstanding electrochemical stability, delivering a capacity of 465.5 mAh g&#8315;&#185; after 300 cycles at 1 A g&#8315;&#185;, and achieving high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% during lithium&#8208;ion battery cycling. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for the synthesis of MXene&#8208;based materials, thus paving the way for accelerating their potential in various fields.

         <title>Constructing Continuously&#8208;Distributed and Crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anode Through Binder Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An innovative, continuously crystalline NaF&#8208;rich SEI is engineered on hard carbon anodes through cost&#8208;effective binder manipulation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred LA133's functional groups synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF, and homogenous LA133 coverage guides continuous NaF growth. The optimized hard carbon anodes deliver excellent storage performances regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Constructing the continuously&#8208;distributed and crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI) is expected to greatly promote the sodium storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, such an impressive concept remains extremely intractable to achieve and lacks an efficiently cost&#8208;less strategy. Herein, the application of the commercially available LA133 binder is pioneered to engineer such a CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI. Through comparative analysis of representative binders with distinct functional groups, reveals the critical role of binder chemistry on SEI regulation. Specifically, the LA133 binder demonstrates a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism for CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI formation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred &#9472;CN bonds induce an anion&#8208;enriched interfacial solvation structure, and the &#9472;CONH/&#9472;CN groups catalytically cleave P&#9472;F bond dissociation in PF6&#8722;, synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF. Furthermore, robust hydrogen bonds between multiple polar groups in LA133 and HC surface create the spatially anion&#8208;confined microenvironments to guide orderly anion decomposition and facilitate continuous NaF growth into a mechanically integrated SEI. The optimized CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI endows HC anodes with exceptional sodium storage performance: an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (95.9%), remarkable reversible capacity (356.6 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling under extreme conditions (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides fundamental insights into binder&#8208;SEI correlations, establishing a novel paradigm for interfacial optimization in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Synchronous Phase Transformation for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DMI is selected to partially replace DMSO. A homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase can be stably formed at spin&#8208;coating stage, and the synchronous phase transformation from the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase occurs at the annealing stage. Thus, a low&#8208;defect and homogeneous halide&#8208;phase WBG perovskite film is obtained. As a result, the DMI&#8208;treated wide bandgap PSCs exhibits an improved PCE and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halogen wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite materials are employed in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their continuous tunability of bandgap. However, inhomogeneous halogen phases are often observed in bromine&#8208;rich perovskite films, which restricts the performance of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and TSCs. Here, homogeneous halogen&#8208;phase perovskite is proposed to form film by a synchronous halogen&#8208;phase transformation strategy. 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, due to its stronger binding energy with lead halide (PbX2). The homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase is stable in precursor solution and at spin&#8208;coating stage. And it then synchronously transforms into a homogeneous halide&#8208;phase perovskite film at the annealing stage. Benefited from efficient carrier extraction and suppressed carrier recombination, the resulting 1.76 eV&#8208;bandgap PSC achieves a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.42% (certified 21.18%) among devices with a bandgap wider than 1.74 eV. Based on the high transmittance of semitransparent&#8208;WBG PSC, a 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSC achieves a PCE of 29.66%.

         <title>Programmable Surface Dimpling of Textile Metamaterials for Aerodynamic Control</title>

Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance. Here, a stretched&#8208;induced auxetic dimpling textile that tunes surface roughness while tightly fitted is presented.

Abstract
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance under variable operating conditions. This challenge is particularly pronounced in high&#8208;speed competitive sports, such as cycling and downhill skiing, where the properties of a static textile surface are mismatched with highly dynamic wind&#8208;speed profiles. Here, an textile metamaterial is introduced that is capable of variable aerodynamic profiles through a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling mechanism, even when tightly conformed to a body or object. Wind&#8208;tunnel experiments are used to characterize the variable aerodynamic performance of the dimpling mechanism, while Finite Element (FE) simulations efficiently characterize the design space to identify optimal textile metamaterial architectures. By controlling dimple size, the aerodynamic performance of the textile can be tailored for specific wind&#8208;speed ranges, resulting in an ability to modulate drag force at target wind&#8208;speeds by up to 20%. Furthermore, the potential for active control of a textiles' aerodynamic properties is demonstrated, in which controlled stretching allows the textile to sustain optimal performance across a dynamic wind&#8208;speed profile. These findings establish a new approach to aerodynamic metamaterials, with surface dimpling and thus variable fluid&#8208;dynamic properties offering transformative applications for wearables, as well as broader opportunities for aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering&#160;systems.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Borohydride Doping in Electrochemical Stability of Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how LiBH4 doping in argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte improves electrochemical stability by forming a tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that promotes ion transport and blocks electrons. In situ XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS show thinner SEI, enhanced Li electrodeposition, and better interfacial wetting compared to baseline LPSCl, highlighting the role of B&#8208;rich layers in interface engineering.









Abstract
This work elucidates the mechanism by which lithium borohydride (LiBH4) doping into argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl (LBH&#8208;LPSCl) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) enhances electrochemical stability. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance is achieved with 5 wt% borohydride. Symmetric cells achieve critical current density (CCD) of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2, versus 2.6 mA cm&#8722;2 for baseline&#8208;LPSCl. All solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing lithium metal and NMC811 cathode are stable over 400 cycles at 0.5C, with capacity retention of 83%. An anode&#8208;free ASSB (AF&#8208;ASSB) is stable over 600 cycles, with capacity loss of 0.04% per cycle. 5LBH&#8208;LPSCl allows for enhanced low temperature operation, down to &#8722;14&#160;&#176;C. Yet the difference in electrolytes&#8217; bulk microstructures and hardnesses are minimal, while ionic conductivity is incrementally improved (&#8776;50%). Theoretical modeling indicates limited effect of substitution on thermodynamic stability of PS43&#8722; units, which decompose when contacting Li. Instead, enhanced electrochemical stability is site&#8208;specific kinetic effect: In situ electrodeposition experiments using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) reveal tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that blocks electrons while facilitating ion transport. This SEI manifests reduced interface resistance and accelerated nucleation and growth of metallic Li. With baseline&#8208;LPSCl the SEI based on Li3P/Li2S is substantially thicker, generating localized stresses that promote interfacial cracking while cycling.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Antimony Chalcogenide Tandem Solar Cells via Thermal&#8208;Evaporated CdS Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing thermal evaporation to prepare high&#8208;quality CdS electron transport layers, this study achieves 7.46% PCE in a semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 device and 10.51% PCE in a 4T Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 tandem cell, surpassing the 10% efficiency limit for all antimony&#8208;based solar cells for the first time.








Abstract
Sb2S3, with an ideal bandgap of 1.7 eV, is a promising top&#8208;cell absorber for tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, CdS electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared via chemical bath deposition suffer from poor crystallinity and high roughness, inducing interfacial defects, parasitic absorption, and severe carrier recombination, which hinder device performance. To address these challenges, this study employs thermal evaporation (TE) to fabricate CdS ETLs for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. The TE&#8208;CdS films exhibit superior crystallinity, reduced roughness, and enhanced chemical purity. Sb2S3 films deposited on TE&#8208;CdS show preferential (hk1) orientation, improved crystallinity, optimized band alignment, and suppressed interfacial defects, facilitating efficient charge transport and light management. By incorporating a MoO3/ITO/Ag electrode, the semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46%, the highest reported efficiency for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. Furthermore, a four&#8208;terminal (4T) TSC, formed by mechanically stacking Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 cells, attains the champion PCE of 10.51% for all&#8208;antimony chalcogenide&#8208;based TSCs. This study provides critical insights into ETL engineering for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent Sb&#8208;based solar cells and their tandem integration.

         <title>Giant Circularly Polarized Luminescence Driven by Excited&#8208;State Hybridization Between Molecular Emitters and Chiral Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental chiroptical response amplification mechanism is revealed to massively enhance molecular helicene chiral emitters. The luminescent dissymmetry factor of the helicene emitter is amplified by 133 times through excited&#8208;state hybridization with a polymeric chiral environment. The amplification mechanism does not rely on a specific energy transfer process, therefore offering new paths for the design of chiral emissive systems.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) light is extensively used in various fields such as asymmetrical synthesis, sensing, and advanced displays. Consequently, significant efforts have been made to develop chiral materials that intrinsically emit CP light with a large dissymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). It is widely considered that the dissymmetry factor for individual organic emitters, due to the amplitude offset between their electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, is limited to &#8776;10&#8722;2, which is inadequate for practical applications. Recent efforts to enhance CP light emission have therefore focused on amplifying the dissymmetry of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), often via specific energy transfer processes. Here, a fundamental mechanism is discovered &#8211; excited&#8208;state hybridization, which amplifies CPL through excitonic coupling without relying on energy transfer processes. Through this wavefunction hybridization, both the amplitude and sign of the rotatory strength related to the molecular emitter's electronic transition are modified to align with its chiral environment, remarkably boosting the CP luminescence from an intrinsic dissymmetry factor of &#8722;10&#8722;3 up to +0.40. This breakthrough allows for more versatile design strategies for chiral emissive systems, moving beyond designs limited to energy transfer processes and paving the way for new approaches to achieve strong CP emissive materials.

         <title>Fundamental Limits on the Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Superconducting Tc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving room&#8208;temperature superconductivity is a major goal in condensed matter physics. This work shows that room&#8208;temperature superconductivity, at least when mediated by phonons, is possible only in hydrogen&#8208;rich compounds known as superhydrides. A central result is the identification of a fundamental upper limit to electron&#8208;phonon interactions beyond which a stable metallic state cannot be maintained.








Abstract
Fundamental upper bounds on the electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature Tc in metals are established based on the intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice under strong interaction. This instability explains why observed electron&#8208;phonon coupling constants are limited to &#955; &#8818; 4. The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced Tc, which emerges near the instability threshold. Based on theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental data, room&#8208;temperature phonon&#8208;mediated superconductivity is found to be feasible exclusively in hydrogen&#160;compounds.

         <title>Robust Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered Co(OH)2/Cu Heterostructures Boost Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia beyond 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy is proposed to engineer robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched Co(OH)2/Cu heterostructures, which boosts hydrogen supply and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting *NO2 to *NOOH step via oxygen vacancy incorporation, thereby enabling high&#8208;current&#8208;density, scalable, and practical NH3 electrosynthesis. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a sustainable paradigm for green NH3 synthesis and NO3&#8722; wastewater valorization. However, overcoming sluggish NO3RR kinetics under industrial&#8208;current operation persists as a critical challenge. Herein, robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched heterostructures (Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2/Cu) are engineered through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. By coupling Cu&#8208;mediated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion with Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;accelerated NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation, this heterostructured system delivers an unprecedented NH3 yield rate of 167.8 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and 97.7% Faradaic efficiency at &gt;2 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining exceptional current tolerance over 25 h. Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ov in Co(OH)2 synergistically accelerates water dissociation to ensure continuous hydrogen supply and optimizes *NOOH adsorption, reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting step (*NO2 to *NOOH). To demonstrate practical viability, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer integrating NO3RR with glycerol oxidation reaction achieves highly effective co&#8208;production of NH3 and formate alongside wastewater treatment. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for scalable and practical NO3RR applications.

         <title>Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single DNA molecules are captured within the hotspots of DNA origami NanoAntennas arranged on a chip surface. Fluorescence is amplified, enabling direct detection on a point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;compatible imaging setup (visualized as bright signals against a dark background).








Abstract
Creating increasingly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) applications. This requires highly specific capture of biomarkers and efficient transduction of capture events.&#160;However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence&#8208;based methods, necessitating molecular amplification. Here, we present single&#8208;molecule detection of a non&#8208;amplified,&#160;151&#8208;nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae down to attomolar concentrations, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). This NACHOS&#8208;diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field&#8208;of&#8208;view, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by NanoAntennas, arranged using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site&#8208;specific DNA origami placement. This method can detect 200&#160;&#177; 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100&#160;&#181;L sample volume within an hour. This represents a typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. This platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification&#8208;based technologies. This provides a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in diverse clinical settings.

An oral, innate immunity&#8208;guided tumor&#8208;homing nanoplatform leverages the migratory behavior of macrophages to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug for immunotherapy and Ag2Te quantum dots for NIR&#8208;II imaging. At the tumor site, &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 reprograms macrophages to enhance immune responses, reduce fibrosis, and improve treatment efficacy, while Ag2Te enables real&#8208;time deep&#8208;tissue imaging of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and a high propensity for liver metastasis. This study presents an innate immunity&#8208;guided, macrophage (M&#934;)&#8208;homing nanoplatform that enables oral delivery of theranostic agents to PDAC lesions by harnessing the migratory behavior of endogenous M&#934; toward tumor&#8208;derived immune cues. The nanoplatform integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug&#8212;constructed by conjugating &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus) with the immunomodulator resiquimod (R848) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linker&#8212;and Ag2Te quantum dots (QDs) for near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, forming &#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te nanoparticles (NPs). Upon oral administration, &#946;Glus facilitates the selective uptake of NPs by intestinal M&#934; (&#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te NPs@M&#934;), which subsequently migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). There, elevated ROS levels trigger the release of R848, reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated M&#934; from an immunosuppressive M2 to an immunoactive M1 phenotype. This immune activation remodels the stroma, enhances T cell infiltration, and transforms the TME into an immunoactive state, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, Ag2Te QDs enable deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;II imaging for real&#8208;time visualization of PDAC progression, liver metastasis, and treatment response. Guided by innate immune signals, this M&#934;&#8208;homing theranostic platform offers a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in PDAC treatment by integrating targeted immunotherapy with noninvasive, real&#8208;time disease monitoring.

         <title>Reengineering Endogenous Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (ENDO) for Systemic Delivery of mRNA to Pancreas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ENDO lipid nanoparticles containing cholecalciferol as a fifth component demonstrate mRNA delivery to the pancreas with 99% selectivity, including beta cells. This platform shows minimal toxicity and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, offering a novel approach to pancreas&#8208;specific mRNA delivery and gene therapy that is suitable for repeat administration with clinical relevance.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) hold transformative potential for nucleic acid delivery, with applications ranging from clinical use, particularly in COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, to gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. However, a major limitation lies in their preferential accumulation in the liver following intravenous administration, making most targets hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach. In this study, a novel platform called endogenous targeting lipid nanoparticles (ENDO), containing cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) as a fifth component is reported, that selectively delivers mRNA to the pancreas &#8211; a target previously inaccessible through intravenous administration. The top formulation, C&#8208;CholF3, demonstrates an unprecedented 99% pancreas selectivity with robust and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner with minimal toxicity that makes it suitable for repeat administration. This organ&#8208;specific delivery is proposed to be mediated by an endogenous targeting mechanism involving the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). C&#8208;CholF3 also enables selective pancreatic delivery of plasmid DNA and circular mRNA, underscoring its versatility and therapeutic potential. Furthermore, C&#8208;CholF3 exhibits pancreas&#8208;specific gene editing in the Ai14 transgenic mouse model, showing high expression of tdTomato in the &#946; cells. These findings highlight its potential for translational applications in protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene editing for currently incurable pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Deficient Chain&#8208;Like Molecular Structure Confined Hydride Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous hydrogen&#8208;deficient LiNBH are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of LiNBH that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion.








Abstract
The practical application of LiBH4 in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) is hindered by low Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature, poor oxidative stability, and severe dendrite growth. Herein, porous [LiNBH]n with a hydrogen&#8208;deficient chain&#8208;like molecular structure are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of [LiNBH]n chains that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion. Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of [LiNBH]n chains induces the local electron localization of LiBH4 that enhances oxidative stability of LiBH4. Therefore, the Li ion conductivity of LiBH4 reaches 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LiBH4, with a voltage window of 5&#160;V. Moreover, the interaction between Li metal and [LiNBH]n chains results in in situ formation of ultrathin layer composed of Li3N and LiB alloys that hinders Li dendrites growth, leading to a critical current density value of 7.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cycling life of 100&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential of 125&#160;mV. Hence, LiCoO2|LiBH4&#8208;70LiNBH|Li cell at 0.5 C deliver a high capacity of 89.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.

         <title>Achieving Abnormal Evaporation Behavior Using Melanin/Cellulose&#8208;Based Solar Evaporators via Salt Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bilayer aerogel with salt ion enrichment, demonstrating exceptional water management and photothermal performance. The aerogel exhibits a higher evaporation rate in high&#8208;salinity brines than in pure water, mitigating performance degradation from salt deposition and hydration effects in seawater desalination. Additionally, it exhibits excellent versatility and long lifetime, offering a viable solution for large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for seawater desalination, offering a potential remedy to the global water crisis. However, its widespread application is hindered by reduced performance in high&#8208;salinity brines and limited evaporator lifetimes. Inspired by natural melanins, amino acid&#8208;doped poly(norepinephrine) nanoparticles (PNE NPs) are developed as photothermal materials, encapsulated in a cellulose&#8208;based aerogel to form a 3D bilayer porous structure with salt ion enrichment effects. The interaction between the enriched ions in the aerogel weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, reducing evaporation enthalpy and enhancing evaporation rates. Under one sun illumination, the evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 4.06&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in high&#8208;concentration saline, surpassing the rate in pure water (3.51&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), with the rate increasing further as salt concentration rises. Notably, even the blank control group without photothermal materials shows an evaporation rate of 1.70&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the aerogel's strong intrinsic evaporation performance. The aerogel maintains its performance over five months of immersion in water without significant degradation. This low&#8208;cost, cellulose&#8208;based aerogel offers a promising solution to the issue of evaporation performance degradation in high&#8208;salinity brines, making large&#8208;scale solar desalination a feasible and effective option.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Like&#8208;Phase Confined Interfacial Polymerization: A Universal Platform for the Controlled 2D Growth of COP Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic abstract illustrates a solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) mechanism, which modulates substrate hydration, solvent density, and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions to localize Tp monomers at the substrate surface. This SLCIP strategy stabilizes the reaction interface, enabling confined 2D polymerization of the COP membrane within a restricted zone, ensuring controlled membrane growth and enhanced separation performance.








Abstract
The scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance covalent organic framework/polymer (COF/COP) membranes faces persistent challenges due to interfacial instability in conventional liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial polymerization (LLIP). Here, a transformative solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) strategy is developed that synergizes substrate hydration&#8208;induced confinement and functionalization&#8208;enabled monomer anchoring for synthesizing ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COP membranes. By orchestrating the hydration barrier and solvent density modulation at functionalized substrates, SLCIP converts the dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid interface into a stable solid&#8210;like phase confined interface. This interfacial confinement engineering enables the ambient synthesis of unique ultrathin COP membranes (&lt;40&#160;nm) via confined 2D reaction zones (1.2&#160;nm thickness via MD simulations). The resulting membranes achieve a record water permeance (161 L m&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; bar&#8315;&#185;, 3.7&#8208;fold enhancement over LLIP), with &gt;98.8% Congo red rejection. Systematic implementation across three solvent systems and five structurally diverse amine monomers demonstrates the universality and chemical adaptability of SLCIP. Industrial scalability is validated through pilot&#8208;scale fabrication of A4&#8208;sized membranes with &lt;5% spatial performance deviation. This work establishes an ambient&#8208;processable interfacial engineering paradigm, offering a sustainable platform for next&#8208;generation molecular separation technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The graphic abstract illustrates a solid-like-phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) mechanism, which modulates substrate hydration, solvent density, and hydrogen-bond interactions to localize Tp monomers at the substrate surface. This SLCIP strategy stabilizes the reaction interface, enabling confined 2D polymerization of the COP membrane within a restricted zone, ensuring controlled membrane growth and enhanced separation performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scalable manufacturing of high-performance covalent organic framework/polymer (COF/COP) membranes faces persistent challenges due to interfacial instability in conventional liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial polymerization (LLIP). Here, a transformative solid-like-phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) strategy is developed that synergizes substrate hydration-induced confinement and functionalization-enabled monomer anchoring for synthesizing ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) COP membranes. By orchestrating the hydration barrier and solvent density modulation at functionalized substrates, SLCIP converts the dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid interface into a stable solid&#8210;like phase confined interface. This interfacial confinement engineering enables the ambient synthesis of unique ultrathin COP membranes (&amp;lt;40&#160;nm) via confined 2D reaction zones (1.2&#160;nm thickness via MD simulations). The resulting membranes achieve a record water permeance (161 L m&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&#8315;&#185; bar&#8315;&#185;, 3.7-fold enhancement over LLIP), with &amp;gt;98.8% Congo red rejection. Systematic implementation across three solvent systems and five structurally diverse amine monomers demonstrates the universality and chemical adaptability of SLCIP. Industrial scalability is validated through pilot-scale fabrication of A4-sized membranes with &amp;lt;5% spatial performance deviation. This work establishes an ambient-processable interfacial engineering paradigm, offering a sustainable platform for next-generation molecular separation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Solvation Chemistries via Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Locally Concentrated Suspension Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal charged suspension electrolyte design strategy is proposed here, which tailors solvation structures and regulates deposition behaviors in Li metal batteries. Negatively charged additives, locally concentrated at the Li metal's surface under the internal electric field, alter the solvation chemistry by interacting with Li ions, resulting in fewer solvating solvent molecules and inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, are in great demand for powering modern society. Their energy density can further be significantly improved by using Li metal anodes; however, Li metal suffers from the critical challenges of unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) along with uncontrollable dendritic Li growth. Here, a universal electrolyte design principle is proposed and demonstrated by using suspension electrolytes with charged additives. The solvation structure of Li ions can be regulated, as negatively charged additives show strong electrostatic interaction with Li ions, leaving them weakly solvated in the electrolyte. Moreover, negatively charged additives carrying Li ions can be locally concentrated at the surface of the Li metal, enhancing their ability to regulate solvation and improve interfacial mobility, beneficial for the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs and compact Li deposition. Accordingly, Li||Li symmetric cell demonstrates &gt;500&#160;h stable cycling at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, and Li||LiFePO4 cell shows 97% capacity retention after 400 cycles in 1C. The universality of this design is further demonstrated in various negatively charged suspension electrolyte systems. Such an electrolyte design rationale can shed light on the development of advanced electrolyte systems for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;duration metal battery systems.

         <title>Tailoring COFs with Water and Oxygen Pathways for Efficient Catalyst Interfaces in PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation and side&#8208;chain engineering created independent water&#8208;oxygen channels in COFs to boost mass transport. Using P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as a binder optimized these channels, greatly enhancing the Pt/C catalyst performance. This resulted in a marked increase in PEMFC peak power density, even with reduced platinum loading, highlighting the role of COFs in improving both catalyst efficiency and transport kinetics.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency and clean emissions. However, reducing platinum (Pt) loadings in PEMFCs remains challenging due to the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. This study investigates phosphorylated covalent organic frameworks (P&#8208;rCOFs) as ionomers in PEMFCs, aiming to optimize the three&#8208;phase interface at the catalyst surface. Through the protonation of tertiary amine sites and precise structural engineering of side chains within the COF framework, well&#8208;defined transport channels are created to enhance water and oxygen mass transfer. The results demonstrate that P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 significantly improves the catalytic performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential 37&#160;mV higher than Nafion. Furthermore, a PEMFC incorporating P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as an ionomer binder achieves a peak power density of 2.40&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 catalyst loading, a 1.5 fold increase over Nafion. This work underscores the potential of P&#8208;rCOFs in optimizing the three&#8208;phase interface, offering a promising pathway for more efficient and cost&#8208;effective PEMFCs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Power and Robust Bi2SeO5 Films Optoelectronic Memristors for Bio&#8208;Visual Perception Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a low&#8208;power, fast&#8208;response Bi&#8322;SeO&#8325; thin&#8208;film&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor with robust performance. Leveraging its dual&#8208;mode operation (photodetector/synaptic device at different wavelengths), a bio&#8208;inspired visual perception/computation system is developed, achieving &gt;160 kbit&#160;s&#8722;1 optical communication and hardware&#8208;based optical reservoir computing, offering an ultrafast, energy&#8208;efficient approach for enhanced bionic vision systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors have broad application prospects in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IOT) because they can dynamically process a large number of spatiotemporal optoelectronic signals in complex environments. However, it is still a challenge to develop optoelectronic memristors with low power consumption and fast response while maintaining the efficiency and robustness of the system. Here, a photoelectric memristor based on Bi2SeO5 thin film is proposed. This device has an ultra&#8208;fast resistance switching speed (&#8776;9.5&#160;ns) and ultra&#8208;low synaptic event power consumption (&#8776;1.36 fJ). The stable instantaneous light on/off response behavior within 4000 cycles and the very fast photoresponse speed (&#8776;28&#160;ns) also confirm the excellent applicability of the device as a photodetector. More importantly, a bionic visual perception and computing system is designed. The system not only uses devices as photodetectors to achieve wireless communication with a speed of more than 160&#160;kb s&#8722;1, but also uses the synaptic effect of devices under bias voltage to realize the optical reservoir computing (RC) network at the hardware level. The accuracy rate of digital recognition is 90.5%, which provides an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;power method for developing widely used and performance enhanced bionic visual systems.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitation&#8208;Modulated Multi&#8208;Color Three&#8208;photon Excited Luminescence in Ln&#8208;MOF Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy toward realizing multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework heterostructure has been developed through a novel hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping method. The as&#8208;obtained heterostructure with wide MPEL color gamut and great up&#8208;conversion luminescent anisotropy is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation is of great application value for optoelectronics, especially MPEL with the characteristics of multi&#8208;color emission and optical anisotropy. However, it still suffers from the obstacles in highly&#8208;integrating and orientedly&#8208;assembly of various MPEL units. Herein, a hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping strategy is proposed to establish a novel lanthanide&#8208;graded metal&#8208;organic framework based heterostructure. Well&#8208;designed ligand and Ln3+ ions are respectively selected as the MPEL energy donor and acceptor units (MEDU and MEAU). Through utilizing the effective energy transfer between them, the as&#8208;obtained triblock heterostructure displays multi&#8208;dimensional three&#8208;photon excited luminescence (3PEL) modulation, where the emission band and intensity can be switched by manipulating excited regions and excitation polarization based on a single pump source. This is attributed to the precise integration and orientation of photonic units. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits multi&#8208;color 3PEL with a record&#8208;high MPEL color gamut (&gt;30% of sRGB area) in MOFs and high degree of linear polarization values (max &#8776;88.6%). Such anisotropic 3PEL modulation shows promising potential in nonlinear optical switches, programmable logic gates, and multi&#8208;level optical barcodes. These findings open up an intriguing way to develop up&#8208;conversion luminescent materials with functions on demand toward photonic modulation.

As a result, the heterostructure exhibits multi-color 3PEL with a record-high MPEL color gamut (&amp;gt;30% of sRGB area) in MOFs and high degree of linear polarization values (max &#8776;88.6%). Such anisotropic 3PEL modulation shows promising potential in nonlinear optical switches, programmable logic gates, and multi-level optical barcodes. These findings open up an intriguing way to develop up-conversion luminescent materials with functions on demand toward photonic modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Dynamic Deprotonation Evolution via Sacrificial Solvation Structure to Mitigate Zinc Electrochemical Corrosion and Cathodic Structure Deterioration for High&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mitigate proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte with distinctive sacrificial solvation structure is developed to suppressing zinc chemical self&#8208;discharge corrosion and electrochemical corrosion for high&#8208;stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium batteries.








Abstract
Compared to the free water molecules induced chemical corrosion, the electrochemical corrosion arising from the structured water elicits more pronounced zinc anode degradation, result in the limited cycle lifespan, especially at low current densities. However, the interfacial degradation mechanism remains inadequately resolved. Herein, for the inhibition of proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte is developed through the chelation of carboxymethyl chitosan (CCS) with Zn2+ ions. In accordance with Fajans' rules, CCS with highly polar carboxylate and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing amino groups exhibits enhanced ionic polarizability, which forms distinctive solvation structures with reduced deprotonation energy. Such solvation structures demonstrate competitive advantages in interfacial deprotonation dynamics and minimize proton release to suppress electrochemical corrosion via sacrificial protection. Furthermore, the crosslinked framework induced by molecular crowding restricts free water mobility, thereby alleviating zinc chemical corrosion and cathodic structure deterioration. By employing advanced MRI technology, the movement trajectories of water molecules and the dynamic deprotonation evolution process are directly visualized. Therefore, the cyclically rested Zn symmetric cell impressively operates 4000&#160;h at low current density of 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn||NH4VO full cell exhibits 81% capacity retention after cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, while the aqueous electrolyte only maintains 31%.

         <title>Element&#8208;Engineered Lithium Borate for High&#8208;Efficiency Prelithiation in Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), is proposed and synthesized based on the non&#8208;metallic element boron (B), which is ultralight, inexpensive, and free of d&#8208;orbitals. LBO exhibits an excellent initial charge specific capacity of 692 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, combined with cost&#8208;effectiveness, outstanding air stability, and strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy density&#160;of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remains a critical challenge for advancing next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. Silicon&#8208;based anodes offer significantly higher theoretical capacitites, but their practical application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), leading to substantial lithium loss and rapid full cell performance degradation. Herein, a novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), based on the ultralight, cost&#8208;effective, and d&#8208;orbital&#8208;free non&#8208;metallic element boron (B) is presented. LBO features a core&#8211;shell architecture, consisting of a crystalline Li3BO3 core encapsulated by Li2CO3 and amorphous carbon, delivering an exceptional initial charge capacity of 692 mAh g&#8722;1 and superior atmospheric stability with 70% capacity retention after 8 days of ambient exposure. When applied in SiOx||LRLO (Li&#8208;rich layered oxide) pouch cells, LBO enhances the gravimetric and volumetric energy density by 14.7% and 21.8%, respectively, while effectively suppressing the irreversible LRLO degradation caused by Li deficiency. This work introduces an element&#8208;centric design methodology for prelithiation agents, providing a promising route to propel the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois Resonators with Tellurium for Battery Thermal Runaway Warning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator with a thin tellurium layer enables rapid, reversible, and untethered detection of battery surface temperature &lt;80 &#176;C. Exploiting tellurium's refractive index change driven by a thermally induced phase transition between solid and quasi&#8208;liquid states, the GT resonator visualizes heat propagation, providing an effective early warning system against battery thermal runaway.








Abstract
Effective temperature monitoring is crucial for preventing battery fires caused by thermal runaway, ensuring human safety, and providing timely warnings. While thermochromic materials offer intuitive, real&#8208;time temperature visualization, their slow response times remain them unsuitable for battery monitoring. A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator specifically designed for rapid and accurate battery temperature detection in the critical range below 80 &#176;C is introduced, where thermal runaway risks can be effectively mitigated. Central to this design is an ultrathin (10&#160;nm) thermo&#8208;responsive tellurium film, paired with a protective glass layer and an underlying metallic mirror. This thermochromic GT resonator exhibits reversible temperature detection over multiple cycles, actively responding to temperature changes through partial melting of tellurium, which alters its complex refractive index&#8212;a property discovered in the 1960s but now harnessed for this novel application. Notably, the resonator monitors both specific temperature points and overall heat transfer across the battery surface, achieving sub&#8208;second response times in an untethered manner. These findings position the thermochromic GT resonator as a promising platform for direct, intuitive, and compact temperature monitoring in energy storage systems.

         <title>Exploring Anionic Redox Chemistry of Battery Cathodes with Resonant Inelastic X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering is a crucial technique for energy storage and energy sustainability due to its superior resolution and uniqueness for studying the anionic redox in cathode materials. This Perspective presents the powerful edges of RIXS as well as its promising capabilities such as imaging and in situ options that further advance the development of battery research.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity and reversible cathodes are important for sustainable energy development. Layered oxides present promising options, achieving a high capacity while maintaining manageable production costs. Despite the redox activity of transition metal primarily contributes to the capacity, anionic redox offers additional potential, as evidenced by the subtle voltage plateau at high voltage. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the reversibility of anionic redox, resulting in voltage fade, hysteresis, and the formation of undesired oxygen species. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (RIXS) captures not only the charge transfer processes between oxygen ligands and transition metals but also the formation of molecular oxygen, elucidating the chemical transformations of oxygen during electrochemical cycles. Mapping capability allows for the generation of spectral patterns with quantitative measures that surpass those achievable by other characterization techniques. Though early reports on its advantages, a comprehensive discussion of RIXS and its perspectives on anionic redox processes in cathode materials remains absent but necessary. This perspective aims to provide a systematic overview of RIXS, emphasizing its unique contributions to cathode material research. It also serves as a valuable reference for energy researchers and RIXS practitioners, featuring the advancements and future possibilities of this powerful technique.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2501565, Xu Chen, Yihang Pan, Tianxin Lin, and co&#8208;workers have established a platform utilizing a CRISPR system&#8208;based bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) for the efficient and cost&#8208;effective targeted delivery of plasmids. The intravesical administration of these engineered OMVs, which encoding CXCL&#8208;9 and IL&#8208;12, have been shown to effectively facilitating T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation. This process enhances the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of OMV&#8208;mediated therapies and increases sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 treatments. Consequently, this approach presents a novel strategy to address resistance to immunotherapy in the context of bladder cancer.

Covalent Adaptable Networks
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds enables both heat&#8208; and light&#8208;driven bond exchange. When combined with magnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature facilitates contactless, reversible, and spatiotemporally controlled 3D shape reconfiguration and fixation during magnetomechanical actuation. More details can be found in article number 2503161 by Sohdam Jeong, Jeong Jae Wie, Chae Bin Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Design Strategies and Advancements in Organic Spintronics: from Material Engineering and Interfacial Modification to Functional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies and advancements in organic spintronics are comprehensively discussed in this review. In the research of active layer materials, spinterface, ferromagnetic electrode preparation, and functional devices, numerous design strategies are devised to optimize their spin&#8208;related performance and propel this field toward practical applications in the near future.








Abstract
Organic spintronics, which has emerged as a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, has recently attracted much research enthusiasm from both the scientific community and industry. As a category of materials typically composed of light elements, organic materials inherently possess weaker spin&#8210;orbit coupling and hyperfine interactions, which are considered beneficial for spin transport. Numerous organic materials have been meticulously synthesized to reveal their structure&#8210;performance relationships. The spinterface effect induced by the ferromagnetic metal/organic material interface has led to novel physical mechanisms. The development of functional devices has promoted this field toward practical applications. Herein, design strategies and advancements in this field are presented, focusing on active material design, interfacial modification, and functional devices. First, the review discusses the influence of the active layer design on spin&#8208;related properties, including the chemical structures of small molecules, polymers, their multicomponent regulation strategies, and chiral materials. Subsequently, the review enumerates reliable ferromagnetic electrode preparation methods and spinterface modification methods aimed at adjusting the spin injection and transport efficiency. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of the strategies for enhancing the performance of functional devices in this field is presented. Finally, a concise summary and prospective outlook are proposed, highlighting the necessity and potential for future advancements in organic spintronics.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Neuromorphic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crossover of additive Manufacturing (AM) and neuromorphic engineering promises a new paradigm in the fabrication of intelligent hardware&#8212;one that is sustainable, scalable, cost&#8208;efficient, and customizable. The AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) is examined, and we discussed the technological integration. Upon overcoming process incompatibility and limited resolution issues of AM, 3D&#8208;printed neuromorphic systems may revolutionize intelligent electronics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering aims to create brain&#8208;inspired computing systems based on synaptic electronic hardware and neural network software. It combines intelligent materials, advanced processing technology, and computation programs. Additive manufacturing (AM), despite being one of the advanced manufacturing technologies capable of multimaterial processing at the microscale, is not widely applied in neuromorphic hardware fabrication. This gap suggests not only process incompatibility and limited resolution of AM but opportunities to create novel intelligent systems. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (synaptic electronics and mechanical systems) is reviewed and discussed the integration of AM techniques with neuromorphic engineering. An outlook of printed neuromorphic systems is provided with low cost and environmental impact but high customizability and design flexibility. With ongoing innovation in AM technologies and materials, AM is envisioned with high throughput and resolution for affordable, scalable, and customizable neuromorphic hardware production. The crossover of AM and neuromorphic engineering facilitates prototyping of brain&#8208;inspired computing architectures for efficient and analog computation. This approach may facilitate various applications including neuromorphic robotics, bionics, and real&#8208;time sensing.

         <title>Advances in Topological Thermoelectrics: Harnessing Quantum Materials for Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer a novel platform for thermoelectric energy conversion through unique band features, including band inversion, linear Dirac bands, surface states, and Berry curvature. These quantum characteristics enable enhanced longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects, establishing topological thermoelectrics as a promising frontier for both fundamental research and advanced energy technologies.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect, which enables the direct conversion of heat into electricity or vice versa, has great importance for condensed matter physics and material science due to its great potential for sustainable energy applications. Topological materials, with their topologically nontrivial band structures and rich physical phenomena, offer exciting opportunities for achieving efficient TE energy conversion. Here, an overview of the recent theoretical is provided and experimental advances at the intersection of topology and thermoelectricity. The unique features of topological materials are examined, such as band inversion, topological surface/edge states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and Berry curvature, affect their TE transport properties. Additionally, the potential of band topology to enhance both longitudinal and transverse TE performance is discussed. The current challenges and prospects for further advancing topological TE materials and devices are identified, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance TE materials and devices.

         <title>Ordering Engineering among the Nanostructure Evolution Facilitates High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition. Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address these issues, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of SEI, managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition. Herein, recent advances in ordering engineering which effectively promote the interface ordering are systematically summarized. The importance of constructing a multilayer SEI with oriented inorganic components and achieving strong Li texture with preferred crystal plane is highlighted. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques employed in ordering engineering are critically reviewed. Finally, the comprehensive examination of challenges encountered in ordering engineering is presented and promising research pathways for future investigation are highlighted. This review aims to encourage discussion and research on the ordering engineering in LMBs, with the goal of enhancing cycle life and safety to accelerate their practical applications.

         <title>Designing the Next Generation of Biomaterials through Nanoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineering enables precise control over biomaterial interactions with living systems by tuning surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity. This review highlights how these nanoscale design parameters drive advances in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, bioprinting, biosensing, and bioimaging, while outlining key translational challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Recent advances in biomaterials science have applied nanoengineering to develop biomaterials with superior properties and tailored functionalities. These unique attributes are achieved due to the ability of nanoengineering to provide precise control over material interactions with living systems at the molecular scale. Here, key nanotechnologies employed to develop the next generation of biomaterials are critically evaluated. A diverse range of nanomaterials, differing in base materials, shapes, sizes, or surface properties can be integrated into various fabrication processes to develop these advanced biomaterials. Further investigation is required into properties such as surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity, as these critically influence the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of nanoengineered materials. Consequently, we explore diverse biomedical applications of nanoengineered biomaterials, including regenerative medicine, biomolecular delivery, additive manufacturing, immune engineering, cancer therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensing, antimicrobial devices, and tissue adhesives. Additionally, their current limitations are analyzed and emerging strategies for designing the next generation of nanoengineered biomaterials are highlighted.

         <title>Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments at the Interface of Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) and their pivotal role in solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) development. It examines various ISE categories, interface characteristics, and commercialization challenges while highlighting advanced characterization techniques and the transformative impact of machine learning in enhancing ISE performance and addressing existing technological barriers.








Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) are critical components of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), and their interfacial properties play a decisive role in battery performance. This paper systematically reviews the recent advances in the interfaces of ISEs. It begins by defining and classifying ISEs&#8212;encompassing oxides, sulfides, and halides&#8212;while highlighting their fundamental characteristics, potential applications, and existing interface challenges. The discussion extends to the composition, structure, and reaction phenomena at the interfaces of SSBs, focusing on how these factors influence internal resistance, cycling stability, and safety. We detail advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed to investigate interfacial microstructures and chemical properties, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance for electrical and structural analysis, while also highlighting emerging modalities for interface characterization in SSBs. Additionally, we explore the role of informatics strategies, particularly high&#8208;throughput computing and machine learning, in predicting interfacial stability, calculating ionic transport properties, and screening new materials to optimize interface engineering. Despite noteworthy progress in understanding ISE interfaces, challenges remain that hinder the commercialization of SSBs. Future research efforts should prioritize the optimization of interfacial structures and properties through multi&#8208;scale and multi&#8208;technique approaches to further accelerate SSB development.

         <title>Strategies for Continuous Responsive Motion in a Constant Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to achieving continuous responsive motion lies in a negative feedback loop between the stimuli received by the responsive material and its own motion behavior. Therefore, this review summarizes four strategies for constructing feedback loops in responsive motion systems, including B&#8208;Z reaction strategy, self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, gradient stimulus field strategy, and complex device&#8208;based strategy.








Abstract
Continuous responsive motion gains significant attention due to its widespread applications in autonomous braking systems, low&#8208;power generation, human&#8208;computer interaction, and other fields. Continuous responsive motion in a constant environment is particularly important because it enables self&#8208;sustained actuation in unmanned settings. In this review, four strategies are summarized for continuous responsive motion in a constant environment and elaborate on the mechanisms, including the Belousov&#8208;Zhabotinsky reaction strategy, the self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, the gradient stimulus field strategy, and the complex device&#8208;based strategy. This study first provides a brief overview of the development history of continuous responsive motion systems in a constant environment. Then, the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application scopes of the four strategies are illustrated. Afterward, the applications of these continuous responsive motion systems are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are presented for the field of continuous responsive motion in a constant environment, offering inspiration for the development of new continuous responsive motion systems.

Solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation is a sustainable water treatment technology for desalination. This review highlights the advantages of biomass materials in solar evaporators, discussing their unique structures, light absorption, and thermal conductivity. It covers design principles, performance enhancement strategies, and recent advancements in biomass&#8208;based evaporators. Challenges and future directions for biomass&#8208;based evaporators are also summarized.








Abstract

Solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation is a green and energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology with diverse applications in desalination, steam power generation, and agricultural irrigation. Biomass materials have gained significant attention in solar evaporator engineering due to their unique structure, low cost, and ease of adjustment. With enhanced light absorption and high thermal conductivity, biomass materials can improve evaporation efficiency substantially, thus providing opportunities in solar evaporation applications. Therefore, in this critical review, the operating principles and design concepts of solar evaporators are first briefly discussed in terms of the photothermal conversion mechanism. Subsequently, the superiority of biomass materials in solar evaporator design is described in detail from the types of biomass and their structural properties at micro/macro scales. The design principles and corresponding performance enhancement strategies for biomass&#8208;based evaporators are also highlighted, including material selection, structural design, and thermal management techniques. Meanwhile, recent advances in biomass&#8208;based evaporators for several cutting&#8208;edge applications are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide a comprehensive reference for the relevant researchers to advance the research and application of biomass&#8208;based solar evaporators and to promote their wide application in the field of green technology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Nanocellulose Composites for Multifunctional Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocellulose composites have significant potential for the multi&#8208;functional remediation of the environment. This review focused on the synthesis strategies (in situ growth, ex situ growth, and other approaches), typical forms (aerogel, hydrogel, beads, and membrane), and applications in the removal of common pollutants (dye, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal ions, VOCs, CO2, PM, and others) in the environment by MOFs&#8208;nanocellulose (MOFs&#8208;NC) composites. The future perspectives and current challenges of MOFs&#8208;NC composites in environmental remediation applications are also pointed out.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in environmental remediation due to their unique properties. However, their practical applications are significantly limited by its powder crystal form. To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass&#8208;derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi&#8208;dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs&#8208;NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2 capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs&#8208;NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationship between multi&#8208;dimensional MOFs&#8208;NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs&#8208;NC composites for future environmental remediation.

         <title>Solving Mazes of Organelle&#8208;Targeted Therapies with DNA Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the evolution of DNA nanomachines as a transformative approach for organelle&#8208;specific cancer treatment. Their design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and enhanced selectivity for precise drug delivery and activation of cell death pathways are examined. Key strategies for subcellular targeting, therapeutic advantages, and the integration of AI&#8208;driven research to accelerate innovation are discussed, providing a roadmap for future clinical translation in advanced cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, cancer remains a growing global health challenge. Nanomaterials&#8208;based therapeutics have shown promise, but their clinical applications are often limited by poor selectivity and undesirable side effects. Recently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based nanomachines have gained attention as intelligent drug carriers due to their ability to precisely target specific organelles. By leveraging rationally designed DNA nanomachines, it is possible to directly attack subcellular structures or deliver therapeutic agents to precise locations, triggering organelle&#8208;mediated cell death. This innovative approach offers several advantages, including enhanced efficacy, lower dosages, minimized off&#8208;target effects, reduced multidrug resistance, and improved therapeutic durability. This review explores the history and advancements of organelle&#8208;targeting strategies, providing new insights into targeting the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes using DNA nanomachines. The review also discusses the structures, design principles, and therapeutic mechanisms of these nanomachines, along with the integration of artificial intelligence&#8208;driven self&#8208;driving laboratories to enhance research growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. Finally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this evolving field are addressed, offering a roadmap for solving the intricate maze of organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapies.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Thermoelectric Strategies for Smart Fire Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoelectric materials for smart fire prevention and early warning. Mechanism&#8208;guided strategies&#8212;such as structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, and ionic thermoelectric effects&#8212;are systematically discussed, offering insights into the development of self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;sensitivity fire warning systems and their integration into next&#8208;generation intelligent fire safety technologies.








Abstract
Fire prevention and early warning systems are essential to minimize fire risks. Thermoelectric (TE) materials that convert temperature gradients into electrical signals offer a promising pathway for designing self&#8208;powered fire&#8208;warning technologies and devices; however, their practical applications are often impeded by their low output power, inefficient charge transport, and poor interfacial compatibility. Despite several relevant reviews focusing on material types, it has remained underexplored from a mechanism&#8208;driven perspective to enhance the fire prevention performance of TE strategies to date. To fill this knowledge gap, this work aims to systematically review TE materials and design strategies, e.g., structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, ionic thermoelectric effects, and interfacial engineering. This work highlights typical applications of TE&#8208;driven fire prevention systems, such as wearable sensors, distributed forest fire monitoring networks, and intelligent building safety systems. Finally, future directions are discussed, which include multifunctional integration, durability under harsh conditions, and AI&#8208;driven fire prediction, paving the way for developing intelligent, self&#8208;powered fire safety technologies. This work underpins how mechanism&#8208;oriented material design advances next&#8208;generation fire warning systems with enhanced sensitivity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous operation, thereby expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation fire&#8208;prevention system and platform.

         <title>Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon stands out with its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and safety. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full&#8208;cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries and inspire future research directions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC&#8208;based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in&#8208;depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full&#8208;cell integration are discussed, such as pre&#8208;sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real&#8208;world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward&#8208;looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium&#8208;ion energy storage.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L, a 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post&#8208;surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D&#8208;printed anti&#8208;tumor vaccine (3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L supports facial integrity post&#8208;surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic&#8208;related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post&#8208;surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.

         <title>High Rate Capability and Cycling Stability in Multi&#8208;Domain Nanocomposite LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 Positive Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By targeting nominally non&#8208;stoichiometric LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 compositions, a multi&#8208;domain nanocomposite rock salt positive electrode material with exceptional cycling stability and excellent rate performance is obtained. This enhanced performance particularly under high oxidative potential protocols and cell electrode mass loadings applicable to commercial cells represents a significant advance for LiNiO2&#8208;based positive electrode materials.








Abstract
LiNiO2 positive electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries have experienced a revival of interest due to increasing technological energy demands. Herein a specific Ti4+ substitution is targeted into LiNiO2 to access new compositions by synthesizing the LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 solid solution with the aim of retaining Ni3+. Compositions in the range 0.025 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.2 form nanocomposites of compositionally homogeneous ordered R3&#175;$\bar 3$m and disordered Fm3&#175;$\bar 3$m rock salt domains as observed via X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction, and STEM. The disordered rock salt domains stabilize the ordered structure to provide excellent structural reversibility via the formation of coherent interfaces during cycling and enable deep delithiation using a constant voltage charging step without structural degradation. The detrimental structural phase transitions associated with the poor cyclability of LiNiO2 are suppressed to yield a low strain positive electrode material with high capacity retention that offers high&#8208;rate capability even under increased cell electrode mass loadings. The composition x = 0.075 (LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2) affords a 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles (100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and demonstrates high reversible capacities of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 even under rates of 3200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2 exhibits exceptional performance at electrode mass loadings (13.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) comparable to those required for commercial cell applications.

         <title>A Novel Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Architecture Revealed by Reconfigurable Synapse for Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel double gate&#8208;controlled synapse transistor featuring a graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes heterostructure is developed, enabling reconfigurable synaptic memory to support Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing (TDM)&#8208;based neural networks. More surprisingly, as the scale of the neural network model gradually increases, the benefits of TDM become more pronounced.








Abstract
Deep learning's growing complexity demands advanced AI chips, increasing hardware costs. Time&#8208;division multiplexing (TDM) neural networks offer a promising solution to simplify integration. However, it is difficult for current synapse transistors to physically implement TDM networks due to inherent device limitations, hindering their practical deployment in modern systems. Here, a novel graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synapse transistor featuring a sandwich structure is presented. This transistor enables the realization of TDM neural networks at the hardware level. In this structure, the 2D perovskite layer, characterized by high ion concentration, serves as a neurotransmitter, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission efficiency. Additionally, the CNTs' field&#8208;effect transistors, with their large on&#8208;off ratio, demonstrate a wider range of synaptic current changes. The device mechanism is theoretically analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Stimulation of Cell&#8208;Based Bioengineered Tissues for In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields enable the construction of 3D tissues from individual cells and their stimulation, activating signaling pathways that influence tissue function. Herein, cyclic magnetic fields induce mechanical perturbations in magnetically responsive tissue implants, promoting osteodifferentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells without biochemical supplementation, enhancing implant integration in vivo, highlighting potential for minimally invasive bone repair strategies.








Abstract
The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano&#8208;instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote&#8208;controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non&#8208;bone environments. MNP&#8208;driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.

         <dc:description>
A unique tri&#8208;system interlocking top&#8208;encased structure is formed for tin&#8208;lead perovskites by the introduction of novel CGA additive. The fabricated tin&#8208;lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.









Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead binary perovskites show a very broad spectral bandwidth from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and outstanding optoelectronic properties for photodetection applications. However, the oxidation tendency of the divalent tin easily causes severe vacancies and defects, deteriorating the efficiency and stability of the device. In this work, without involving any costly synthesis of additives, a natural reducing agent of chlorogenic acid is proposed to establish a unique top&#8208;encased tri&#8208;system interlocking structure in tin&#8208;lead perovskites. Benefiting from the synergetic closed&#8208;loop interactions among functional groups of the additive with perovskites, tin&#8208;lead perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are demonstrated with improvements in energy&#8208;level alignment, antioxidation, and defect suppression and passivation. Finally, the self&#8208;powered perovskite NIR PDs present a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;76%, an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940&#160;nm, and a large linear dynamic range of 222&#160;dB, along with good stability maintaining 96% of initial photocurrent after 127 days for the unencapsulated PDs storing under N2 atmosphere. By integrating with a 64 &#215; 64 thin&#8208;film transistor array, the tin&#8208;lead perovskite image sensor exhibits clear and accurate imaging properties, paving the way for a wide range of high&#8208;detectivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging applications.

The fabricated tin-lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.

         <title>Signal Transducer Nanoparticles Enable Siglec&#8208;10/G Blockade Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibody&#8208;free approach to block the &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling is achieved through using the CD24 signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). These STNPs effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.








Abstract
Current treatments for breast cancer (BC), particularly triple&#8208;negative BC, are limited in efficacy due to drug resistance and high recurrence rates. CD24, which is highly expressed in BCs and engages with its receptor Siglec&#8208;10/G (Siglec&#8208;10 in humans and Siglec&#8208;G in mice) on immune cells, represents a promising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) target. As the engagement is mediated by a short signal transducer (ST) peptide displayed on the BC cell surface, targeting the peptide using antibodies has shown to be effective for BC treatment. Herein, an antibody&#8208;free approach is reported to achieve blockade of the CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling through the synthesis of signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). The STNPs can effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of BC cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. The therapeutic effects can be further improved through encapsulation of RRx&#8208;001, a small molecule inhibitor of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling. Compared to the antibody approach, the synthetic nanoparticle approach offers greater efficacy with lower side effects and enables combination therapy through a simple formulation. Moreover, the approach is versatile and could be adapted for targeting other ICB signaling, advancing the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>An Intrinsically Stretchable Skin&#8208;Adhesive Actuator With Structurally Anisotropic Multiphase Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator is realized using a hybrid architecture combining anisotropic and isotropic 3D porous dielectric architectures. The seamless integration of an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator ensures reliable haptic feedback even under extreme deformation. Featuring a bio&#8208;inspired design, it forms a conformal contact with human skin, effectively stimulating tactile receptors with high&#8208;vibration acceleration, delivering precise and high&#8208;fidelity feedback.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable actuators require robust adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity feedback to conform to the skin under extreme deformation, integrating seamlessly while minimizing damping effects for diverse practical applications. Current rigid haptic interfaces and soft dielectric materials are limited to operating effectively within specific resonance frequencies, exhibiting a mechanical mismatch with human skin, which reduces their effectiveness on highly deformable body parts and decreases the accuracy of vibration feedback. Moreover, intrinsically stretchable dielectric materials face challenges caused by layer integration and significant damping from single anisotropic architectures. Here, an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator (ISSA) with a multiphase dielectric architecture is presented that combines an isotropic spring matrix and an anisotropic elastic damper matrix, achieving stable vibration performance beyond the resonance frequency. The intrinsically stretchable electrode with its hybrid 1D/0D percolated structure ensures adaptability and reliable performance under strains exceeding 500%, whereas the frog&#8208;inspired adhesive enhances skin conformity and breathability, providing robust shear strength (&#8776;28.4&#160;kPa) under extreme deformation. Owing to a seamlessly integrated design and ultralow modulus (&lt;24&#160;kPa), the skin&#8208;adhesive actuator closely conforms to the human skin, delivering high vibrational acceleration while ensuring biocompatibility and durability for transformative applications in soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and haptic technologies.

         <title>Enhanced Ising Superconductivity and Emergent Ferromagnetism Coexisting in Bimolecule&#8208;Intercalated Bulk TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers report the coexistence of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism in TBAC/DMF&#8208;intercalated TaS2, accompanied by a quantum Griffiths singularity. This structure results in an enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity, with the in&#8208;plane upper critical field reaching five times the Pauli limit and the superconducting temperature increasing to &#8776;2.7 K. Distinct ferromagnetic ordering persists from below the superconducting temperature up to 365 K.








Abstract
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive in most cases. Here the observation of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexisting is reported in a bimolecule (tetrabutylammonium chloride and dimethylformamide, or TBAC/DMF)&#8208;intercalated bulk TaS2, with the exotic phenomenon of quantum Griffiths singularity. It is first shown that the neighboring TaS2 layers are separated by 14.7 &#197;, indicating vertical stacking of the TBAC and DMF molecules. Such a record&#8208;large interlayer spacing renders each TaS2 layer to be of exceptionally 2D nature in an otherwise 3D structure, as manifested by substantially enhanced Ising superconductivity with in&#8208;plane upper critical field five times the Pauli limit. The corresponding superconducting transition temperature is &#8776;2.7 K, more than tripled from that of pristine bulk TaS2 (&#8776;0.8 K), and again approaches that of monolayer TaS2 (&#8776;3 K). Strikingly, distinct ferromagnetism is observed below the superconducting temperature, and the ferromagnetic order persists all the way up to 365 K. These findings characterize TBAC/DMF&#8208;TaS2 as a fertile platform for exploration of rich physical phenomena with significant technological potentials in superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Acousto&#8208;Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)2&#183;2H2O (1, Tc &gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML&#8208;driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.








Abstract
The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real&#8208;life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound&#8208;induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide&#8208;based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)] (BF4)2.2H2O (1) complex with an impressive output peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low&#8208;frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI&#8208;driven voice&#8208;recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.

     alt="Acousto-Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L-phe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (1, Tc &amp;gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML-driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short-circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real-life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound-induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide-based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L-phe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] (BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) complex with an impressive output peak-to-peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low-frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI-driven voice-recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dielectric Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Dual&#8208;Band Robust Optical Performance for Low&#8208;Cost Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a gravity&#8208;induced particle aggregation strategy, the distribution of merely 4 vol% packed dielectric silica in the porous skeleton is tuned to yield a decoupled spectral response spanning two orders of magnitude. This strategy allows for on&#8208;demand manufacture of other types of metamaterials and integrates robust weather resistance properties.








Abstract
Radiative cooling belongs to passively enhanced heat dissipation that reflects sunlight and emits infrared radiation. However, conflicting reflectivity and emissivity across the two bands present challenges to reach 95% performance simultaneously, while a few available photonic reports have shortcomings in terms of scalability and environmental stability. The decoupling optimization of scattering and absorption is demonstrated by modulating the aggregation state of merely 4 vol% dielectrics in the porous skeleton. It allows Mie scattering and resonant absorption to function in their respective bands, resulting in a double 95% optical performance. Such a broad spectral response enables high&#8208;throughput heat dissipation of 8&#160;&#176;C and supports subambient cooling of 5&#160;&#176;C outdoors. This one&#8208;step strategy extends to the manufacture of a range of metamaterials as required for strength, heat resistance, and degradation, combined with robust environmental stability, including resistance to fouling and peeling.

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal&#8208;Based Physical Unclonable Function Integrating Optical and Electrical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable physical unclonable function (PUF) integrating optical and electrical responses in organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by using unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic liquid crystal. This approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;a hardware&#8208;based security device using randomness&#8212;have evolved from basic integrated circuit designs to advanced systems using diverse materials and mechanisms. However, most PUFs are limited by single&#8208;factor challenges and fixed key generation, making them vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks. A reconfigurable and multidimensional liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based PUF is presented integrated into an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) to address limitations. This system combines optical and electrical PUFs through unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic LC material. The PUF can be reconfigured by a simple heating and cooling process, overcoming the limitations of fixed&#8208;structure PUFs. Furthermore, this approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication due to the multi&#8208;response factors, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method is presented for single&#8208;protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost&#8208;effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.









Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross&#8208;section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single&#8208;molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary&#8208;Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real&#8208;time Raman detection is achieved with a Single&#8208;Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single&#8208;molecule detection at 1&#160;nm concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.

         <title>Flippase&#8208;Mediated Hybrid Vesicle Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p flippase in small and giant polymer lipid hybrid vesicles is illustrated. The hybrid vesicles show adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate consumption and flipping of 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. This induced transmembrane asymmetry results in constriction and division of the giant hybrid vesicles.








Abstract
The assembly of synthetic systems with the ability for protein&#8208;mediated division remains a challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here, the reconstitution of an active Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p lipid flippase in polymer lipid hybrid vesicles (HVs) made from phospholipids and 1 or 2.5 mol% amphiphilic block copolymers, with poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) or poly(6&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose) as the hydrophilic extension and either cholesteryl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate or combinations thereof as the hydrophobic blocks is demonstrated. The reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p in HVs flip 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine (DOPS) lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet, leading to transmembrane asymmetry. Importantly, the chemical nature of the hydrophobic block in the amphiphilic block copolymers used to assemble the HVs is crucial to support changes in the spontaneous curvature of the bilayers due to translocation of DOPS lipids that results in HV constriction and division. Taken together, this effort is a step forward in imitating cell division in synthetic assemblies toward potentially bottom&#8208;up assembled self&#8208;replicating units.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Rashba Effect with Suppressed Spin Relaxation in a Polar Phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with enhanced spin&#8208;relaxation time in a new polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 (x &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.34). Unlike typical Rashba systems, which suffer from rapid spin relaxation, this polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 exhibits both high Rashba strength and long spin&#8208;relaxation time due to a polar&#8208;crystal symmetry with a unidirectional spin texture. This work expands Rashba physics to 3D systems, with potential for spintronic devices.








Abstract
The Rashba effect enables control over the spin degree of freedom, particularly in polar materials where the polar symmetry couples to Rashba&#8208;type spin splitting. The exploration of this effect, however, has been hindered by the scarcity of polar materials exhibiting the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect and rapid spin&#8208;relaxation effects dictated by the D'yakonov&#8211;Perel mechanism. Here, a polar LiNbO3&#8208;type R3c phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 with x &#8776;0.15&#8211;0.24 is stabilized via epitaxial growth, which exhibits a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with suppressed spin relaxation as a result of its unidirectional spin texture. As compared to the previously observed non&#8208;polar Pnma phase, this polar phase exhibits higher conductivity, reduced bandgap, and enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric responses. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and multimodal magnetotransport measurements, which reveal weak (anti)localization, anisotropic magnetoresistance, planar&#8208;Hall effect, and nonreciprocal charge transport, a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect without rapid spin relaxation is demonstrated. These findings offer insights into spin&#8208;orbit coupling physics within polar oxides and suggest potential spintronic applications.

         <title>mTORC1 Selective Nano&#8208;Inhibitor by Disrupting the Lysosomal Arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208; mTORC1&#8208;CDKs Axis for Precision Bladder Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for mTORC1 specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway is presented. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a paradigm, nanomedicines like ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO are developed. They degrade Arg in lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 and mTORC1.








Abstract
The absence of precise targeting and defined mechanisms, akin to small molecules, remains a major barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism, is linked to abnormal activation in various diseases like cancers. While small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of mTORC1 are limited, they remain a focus. Here, a strategy is presented for mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine (Arg)&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a universal paradigm, nanomedicines are developed (e.g., ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO) that degrade Arg in the lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 activation and blocking mTORC1 recruitment. ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO inhibits mTORC1 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.07 ng mL&#8722;1), with three orders of magnitude greater specificity than the clinical small molecule rapamycin. SLC38A9 knockout abolishes nanomedicine efficacy. Differential responses to the inhibitors are also observed in normal and bladder cancer cells, linked to SLC38A9 expression levels, suggesting potential for precise treatment of non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In vivo, ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO combined with photodynamic therapy outperformed MMC in preventing tumor recurrence and extending survival. This work establishes a promising approach for developing mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors with well&#8208;defined targets and mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of precision nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Luminescent Perovskite Quantum Dot/Polymer Composites: Scalable Synthesis, Continuous Processing and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed to in situ synthesize perovskite QD/polymer composites, which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new&#8208;generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X&#8208;ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability. However, there is still a lack of feasible strategies to achieve large&#8208;scale production of perovskite QD&#8208;based polymer composites. In this study, a solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed enable to continuously production of perovskite QD/polymer composites using a screw extruder. Rational raw material selection allows QDs to be uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, resulting in efficient luminescent features (e.g., the green CsPbBr3 QD/PS composites with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%). Meanwhile, polymer encapsulation obviously enhances the stability of QDs against the external environment. Importantly, the strategy is a continuous process (only raw material loading is required), which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. Furthermore, the potential applications of as&#8208;prepared QD&#8208;based polymer composites is demonstrated in various light conversion fields, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), scintillators, displays, and luminescent textiles. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.

         <title>Reversible Thermochromic Organosilicon Fibers Based on TiO2@AgI Composites: Preparation, Properties, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;high temperature reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber is prepared by a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method, which has a large color difference (&#916;E = 25.72), excellent cyclic stability (170 times), and high sensitivity (135.4&#160;&#176;C). The fiber also combines high strength (9.89&#8211;11.33 MPa), durability (500 times), biocompatibility, and antimicrobial properties, and is suitable for use in the field of medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.








Abstract
The application of reversible thermochromic fibers (RTFs) is expanding from the smart wearable field toward industrial temperature detection and safety warning; however, most RTFs suffer from low color change temperature thresholds and poor thermal stability, which restrict their applications in medium and high&#8208;temperature places (&gt;100&#160;&#176;C). Currently, overheating of equipment is a key factor that causes safety accidents, and the development of reliable visualized temperature warning materials is of great practical significance for accident prevention. To address these issues, TiO2@AgI is blended with a ternary organosilicon oil spinning solution via a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method to obtain a reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber (TSiF) suitable for use in medium and high&#8208;temperature environments owing to its thermal stability. Among them, TiO&#8322;@AgI1.1@SiF&#8208;2 has the best performance, showing a significant white to bright yellow color change (color difference &#916;E = 25.72) at 135.4&#160;&#176;C. It still possesses the thermochromic performance after 170 cycles and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 9.89&#8211;11.33&#160;MPa, no decay in 500 cycles), significant biocompatibility and antimicrobial ability, which fully meets the requirements for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning. Thus, this study provides a new idea for fabricating RTFs that can be used for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.

To address these issues, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@AgI is blended with a ternary organosilicon oil spinning solution via a high-temperature air-induced crosslinking method to obtain a reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber (TSiF) suitable for use in medium and high-temperature environments owing to its thermal stability. Among them, TiO&#8322;@AgI&lt;sup&gt;1.1&lt;/sup&gt;@SiF-2 has the best performance, showing a significant white to bright yellow color change (color difference &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; = 25.72) at 135.4&#160;&#176;C. It still possesses the thermochromic performance after 170 cycles and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 9.89&#8211;11.33&#160;MPa, no decay in 500 cycles), significant biocompatibility and antimicrobial ability, which fully meets the requirements for medium and high-temperature warning. Thus, this study provides a new idea for fabricating RTFs that can be used for medium and high-temperature warning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accompanying Structural Transformations in Polarity Switching of Heavily Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity switching of heavily doped p&#8208;type conjugated polymers (CPs) toward environmentally stable electron&#8208;rich thin films is demonstrated. Multiscale analyses, incorporating spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scattering techniques, reveal structural and chemical transformations induced by excessive doping with AuCl3. Leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a flexible homojunction p&#8208;n diode is fabricated using a single CP&#8208;dopant system with a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of &#8776;105.








Abstract
Despite significant recent advancements in highly functional organic semiconductors (OSCs), the n&#8208;type OSCs reported to date lag behind their p&#8208;type counterparts in terms of long&#8208;term environmental stability. As an alternative approach to n&#8208;type materials, a few p&#8208;type polymers have been shown to undergo dramatic transitions in their charge carrier polarity to n&#8208;type through transition metal&#8208;incorporated Lewis acid doping. Although the concept of polarity switching is promising, its unclear chemical origin&#8212;particularly from a materials science perspective&#8212;limits its potential as an n&#8208;type counterpart. In this work, the chemical and structural mechanisms underlying the p&#8208;to&#8208;n polarity switching in a heavily doped conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using gold(III) chloride&#8208;doped indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) as a model system, doping&#8208;induced thin&#8208;film structural changes are investigated. Quantitative X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of doped IDTBT films provides direct evidence of oxidation state changes in Au and Cl ions and confirms the covalent chlorination of the polymer backbone, establishing a direct correlation between the chemical doping mechanism and polarity switching. Finally, leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a p&#8208;n homojunction organic diode is demonstrated with a rectification ratio of 104&#8211;105, highlighting the versatility and potential of this excessively p&#8208;doped n&#8208;type OSC system for tailoring charge transport properties.

         <title>Unveiling Competitive Coordination in Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Electrolytes through Solvent Descriptor Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically establishes co&#8208;solvents selection criteria to achieve balanced solvation behavior by exploring the impacts of &#603; and &#181; on solvation structure. Cosolvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) with moderate &#603; (&#603; = 37.8) and high &#181; (&#181; = 3.7 D), can counterbalance the fast diffusion capabilities of water molecules, thereby reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. The LDH&#8208;2 m electrolyte enables the suppressed HER and formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical window and unstable hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of aqueous electrolytes hinder the potential application of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These problems are actually related to the solvation structure of the electrolyte, which is determined by the competition among anions, water molecules, and cosolvent coordinated with Li+. Herein, this work proposes a direct solvent descriptor for conveniently designing electrolytes, which facilitates a pronounced level of Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; and Li+&#8208;DMAC coordination within the solvation sheath through synergistic effect of the dielectric constant and dipole moment. This strategy significantly reduces the involvement of water in the primary solvation shell and generates stable interfacial chemistry. Such an electrolyte regulated by competitive coordination leads to wide electrochemical stability window of 4.55 V and suppressed HER, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8208;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with the high discharge capacity of 138.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and average Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 1000 cycles at 3 C rate. The proposed strategy of solvation structure modification by regulating cation competitive coordination offers a promising approach for achieving stable aqueous batteries with high energy density.

         <title>Initiating Strain Field for Mitigating Lead Leakage in Perovskite Solar Cells with Built&#8208;in Encapsulating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small&#8208;area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their unsatisfactory operational stability and lead (Pb) leakage remain major obstacles to commercialization. Nevertheless, with the Pb precipitation mechanism remaining elusive, the community has long been under the impression that preventing Pb leakage mainly lies in the out&#8208;film encapsulation. Here, that in&#8208;film reinforcement is demonstrated through the synergy of built&#8208;in chemical sealing networks encapsulating and balanced compressive strain field plays a pivotal role in elevating the thermodynamic barrier for structural dissociation, thereby preventing Pb leakage from severely damaged devices exposed to external stimuli. Through in situ planar&#8208;resolved cathodoluminescence and depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering, the spatial evolution of secondary Pb phases is further elucidated within the perovskite films. Consequently, a remarkable 96.98% inhibition rate for Pb leakage from damaged PSCs is achieved. Furthermore, the impressive PCEs of 26.11% in a cell (0.10&#160;cm2) and 20.41% in a module (100&#160;cm2) are achieved. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs maintain 97.05% of their initial PCE over 2160&#160;h under humidity ambient. This work highlights the conceptual insights into mitigating Pb leakage by controlling in&#8208;film structural rigidity, thus paving the way for the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

Combining these experimental results with first-principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Transient Unilateral Adhesive Recombinant Collagen&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Reversible Fibrosis Induction and Full&#8208;Cycle Management of Pancreatic Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, injectable recombinant collagen&#8208;based hydrogel plug with targeted drug delivery is developed for full&#8208;cycle management of pancreatic fistula. Featuring enzyme resistance, transient unilateral adhesion, and reversible fibrosis induction, this hydrogel achieves 100% sealing efficiency and provides comprehensive therapeutic effects, including hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and reversible inhibition of exocrine function. This study pioneers the application of sequence&#8208;engineered recombinant collagen in pancreatic fistula treatment.








Abstract
Currently, no effective treatment for pancreatic fistula (PF) exists, which has a mortality rate &gt;40%. Existing protein&#8208;based physical barriers face the challenges of rapid degradation, lack of self&#8208;adhesiveness, and the inability to promote PF healing. To overcome this, a novel enzyme&#8208;resistant and highly bioactive hydrogel (CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II)) is developed using glycidyl methacrylate recombinant collagen (enzyme&#8208;cleavage&#8208;free) and oxidized pullulan as backbone molecules, which is further loaded with a penicillin G&#8208;Cu(II) infinite coordination polymer nanomedicine. This hydrogel can adapt to irregular PF wounds through injectable self&#8208;leveling and achieve transient unilateral adhesion via light&#8208;activated radical crosslinking with tissue&#8208;inherent molecules. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its ability to provide full&#8208;cycle PF management by serving as a long&#8208;lasting physical barrier while offering antimicrobial properties, rapid hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, reversible fibrosis induction, and enhancing pancreatic tissue repair. The anti&#8208;PF efficacy of the CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II) hydrogel at day 7 is 100%, highlighting its strong potential for clinical postoperative PF prevention.

         <title>Synergistic Compound Additives for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite electrolyte with LiNO&#8323;, SAC, and OP&#8208;10 additives stabilizes lithium anodes and suppresses polysulfide shuttling in Li&#8211;S batteries. This strategy enables Li||Li symmetric cells to cycle under the challenging condition of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 1400 h and enhances high&#8208;loading sulfur cathode performance, offering a promising electrolyte engineering approach for advanced metal&#8208;based energy storage systems.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, with theoretical energy densities exceeding 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, are poised to revolutionize energy storage. However, their practical viability hinges on resolving two critical challenges: uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth at the anode and polysulfide shuttling at the sulfur cathode. Here, a compound additive integrating lithium nitrate (LiNO3), sodium saccharin (SAC), and octaphenyl polyoxyethylene (OP&#8208;10) is proposed to construct an electrolyte for Li&#8211;S battery. With the compound additive added, the as&#8208;prepared electrolyte is capable of evolving a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with refined morphology while suppressing polysulfide reactivity. The synergistic effects of this additive enable Li|Li symmetric cells to achieve unprecedented cycling stability (&gt;1400 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and Li&#8211;S full cells with high sulfur loading (4.12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) to retain 2.72 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 150 cycles. This work underscores the importance of dual&#8208;electrode stabilization in electrolyte design, offering a scalable strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries and related systems plagued by dendrites and shuttle effects. This study highlights the effectiveness of synergistic electrolyte engineering in suppressing lithium dendrites and polysulfide shuttling, providing new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and other energy storage systems facing similar challenges.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Stacking Fault&#8208;Free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 unveils in&#8208;plane sliding of corrugated MnO2 as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn&#8208;based layered oxides for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Understanding the solid&#8208;state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&#946;&#8208;NaMnO2) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &#945;&#8208;type planar domains among &#946;&#8208;type corrugated MnO2 layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 yields SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF&#8208;free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers. The proposed gliding mechanism is validated both experimentally, using ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretically, through density functional theory calculations. Minor structural changes observed in SF&#8208;containing materials indicated that gliding is extremely sensitive to SFs. Given that the SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;material exhibits excellent cycle stability in a Na cell, the corrugated layer is concluded to have high resilience and reversibility against repeated large anisotropic structural changes involving slab gliding, providing a new insight into the design of long&#8208;life rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Transparent Anti&#8208;Icing Moir&#233;&#8208;Film Enhancing Photovoltaic Stability in Extreme Cold Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving effective de&#8208;icing without sacrificing photovoltaic efficiency remains challenging. A scalable, transparent photothermal film is developed with moir&#233; structures that enable efficient ice removal and restore winter solar output. Under snow&#8208;covered conditions, it achieves up to a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power generation.








Abstract
Accelerated degradation and power loss of solar cells in cold climates remain major challenges to renewable energy deployment. The photothermal film offers a promising solution by converting sunlight into heat to remove ice and snow from solar panels. However, enhancing photothermal performance often entails reduced visible (VIS) light transmittance of films, thereby compromising solar cell efficiency. Tailoring optical designs to balance the optimal light absorption between the device and the film is essential for photovoltaic anti&#8208;icing/snow. Herein, we present outdoor data from grid&#8208;connected photovoltaic modules, revealing a 58% electricity loss caused by ice/snow shading effects. To address this, we developed transparent photothermal films featuring a moir&#233; light&#8208;trapping structure, achieving high VIS transmittance (&#8764;93.0%) and enhanced near&#8208;infrared absorption (&#8764;65.8%). We confirmed that the meter&#8208;scale photothermal film ensures that operational modules remain ice&#8208;free in &#8722;20 &#176;C outdoor conditions, and the ice&#8208;melting phase diagram indicates its effective anti&#8208;icing range down to &#8722;30 &#176;C under AM 1.5G, one&#8208;sun illumination. Day&#8208;night cycling tests on perovskite cells demonstrated sustained anti&#8208;icing performance, yielding a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power output during winter conditions. The film's long&#8208;term stability and robust de&#8208;icing performance under weak&#8208;light scenarios demonstrate the its feasibility for extreme cold applications.

         <title>Dual Roles of Deep Eutectic Solvent in Polysulfide Redox and Catalysis for Intermediate&#8208;Temperature Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

A dual&#8208;functional NiS&#8208;DES interfacial strategy enables highly reversible K2S2/K2S conversion in intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries by balancing adsorption and activation of intermediates at the catalytic interface, achieving high capacity, long cycle life, and low&#8208;cost energy storage.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8208;S) batteries hold great promise for long&#8208;duration energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the irreversible deposition of K2S2/K2S severely hinders sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Herein, a NiS&#8211;DES interfacial regulation strategy is developed that leverages the dual functionality of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) to govern the adsorption and conversion behavior of K2S2/K2S at the catalytic interface, enabling their highly reversible transformation. Specifically, DES forms moderate electronic coupling with NiS to weaken the excessively strong adsorption of K2S and prevent catalyst deactivation. Simultaneously, strong electronic interactions between DES and K2S promote interfacial activation and conversion, thereby extending the reaction pathway and enhancing reduction depth. As a result, the intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries deliver an initial capacity of 810 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a minimal capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle over 1300 cycles at 6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading. Even under lean catholyte (4.2 &#181;L&#160;mg[sulfur]&#8722;1) and higher sulfur loading (12&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), they achieve 521 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 initially, retaining stability with 0.03%/cycle decay over 500 cycles. This NiS&#8208;30DES system achieves a cell&#8208;level energy density exceeding 150&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a low levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $140/MWh, demonstrating strong potential for scalable long&#8208;duration energy storage.

         <title>Revisiting the Impact of Anion Selection on Sulfur Redox Reaction Kinetics for High Sulfur Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Sulfur redox reactions are systematically evaluated with nine commercial lithium salts and developed a new LiTFSI&#8208;free, PFAS&#8208;free electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. LiBOB, once considered incompatible, forms a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, suppressing the shuttle effect and delivering excellent performance in high&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S cells, offering a more sustainable electrolyte strategy.








Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is widely used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery electrolytes due to its stability with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and moderate compatibility with lithium metal anodes. However, LiTFSI presents environmental concerns due to its association with per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic, raises sustainability concerns. This research also reveals that LiTFSI limits sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), making it less effective than other lithium salts.&#160;Additionally, some salts previously considered incompatible with Li&#8208;S systems due to their reactivity with LiPSs are demonstrated to perform effectively. For the first time, a protective, porous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed in situ through reactions between salt anions and LiPS is reported. The cells delivered a high specific capacity of 1230.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C with a sulfur loading of &#8776;6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, limited lithium anode, maintaining a capacity retention of 76.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Under harsh conditions, such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), and in anode&#8208;free cells, the cells continued to deliver outstanding capacity. This work provides valuable guidelines for understanding and selecting lithium salts to advance electrolyte design for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Sensitive Implantable NIR Phototransistor for One&#8208;Click Pain Relief Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic near&#8208;inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real&#8208;time pain relief for medical application advancing.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology. Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on&#8208;demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near&#8208;infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk&#8208;heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 1013 Jones. By integrating the device with an oscillating circuit, the 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation with varying light intensities can trigger inhibiting voltage ranging from 1&#160;kHz to 50&#160;kHz. This allows for one&#8208;click precise manipulation of neural activity in rat sciatic nerves, achieving up to 99.4% signal suppression within just 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the nearly real&#8208;time elimination of pain sensation is confirmed by measuring the amplitude of hind paw reflex movements of rats. These findings pave a novel way for the development of advanced pain relief systems for medical applications.

         <title>Tailored Heterogeneous Interphase Layer Promotes Low&#8208;Temperature Desolvation Toward Durable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous artificial interphase is constructed to stabilize sodium metal anodes at subzero temperatures. The tailored sodiophilic interface facilitates Na+ desolvation and regulates uniform deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work offers a practical strategy to enhance interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries.









Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology due to their low cost and high energy density. However, SMBs face significant challenges, including interfacial instability and the growth of sodium dendrites on the metal anode, particularly at low temperatures (LTs). Poor ion desolvation at LTs further exacerbates these issues, severely compromising battery performance. To address these problems, a heterogeneous artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of Na3VO4 and metallic In (NVO&#8208;In@Na) is designed for LT SMBs. The sodiophilic Na3VO4 promotes sodium ion adsorption, while the Na2In phase formed during the initial plating enhances ion transport kinetics, resulting in uniform Na deposition behavior. Theory calculations indicate that the Na3VO4/Na2In interface accelerates charge transfer processes and desolvation. The engineered NVO&#8208;In@Na anode demonstrates exceptional stability: symmetric cells operate for over 2000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions and exceed 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Full cells paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode retain 97% capacity after 1150 cycles at 0.5 C and &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of rational SEI design to overcome critical limitations of SMBs, advancing high&#8208;performance energy storage under extreme conditions.

         <title>Subsurface Electron Trap Enabled Long&#8208;Cycling Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the subsurface electron confinement in Mo&#8208;based catalysts by incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms as subsurface traps. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies Mo&#8211;O orbital hybridization, stabilizing lithium oxalate while suppressing the formation of lithium carbonate. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries exhibit unprecedented efficiencies and cycling stabilities at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries promise ultrahigh theoretical energy densities but face efficiency limitations owing to the sluggish decomposition of stable Li2CO3. Redirecting the redox pathway toward Li2C2O4 overcomes this challenge, but its metastability leads to facile conversion to Li2CO3 during discharge. Herein, subsurface electronic confinement is engineered in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, leveraging electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) as electron traps in the subsurface atomic layers to tailor their interfacial electronic landscapes. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies the hybridization between the Mo d&#8208;orbitals and O p&#8208;orbitals of oxalate. Strengthening the Mo&#8208;O interaction stabilizes Li2C2O4 against decomposition. The highly reversible and stable redox chemistry enabled by MoB results in an exceptional cycling stability and energy efficiency across a wide temperature range, with an expanded practical viability. At 70&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, the MoB&#8208;based battery is cycled for &gt;1400&#160;h with a high energy efficiency of &gt;85%. The energy efficiency even remains at &gt;90% for &#8776;150&#160;h at a high temperature (90&#160;&#176;C). This study pioneers a material design framework for use in stabilizing metastable products within Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, advancing their applicabilities in extreme environments, such as deep&#8208;earth exploration, by revealing the role of subsurface charge redistribution in steering reaction pathways.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Bifunctional Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Induce the Directional Generation of Radical in Catalytic Ozonation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This bifunctional catalyst synergizes Ca&#9472;O alkaline sites (boosting &#183;OH generation) and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers (dominate the generation of &#183;O2&#8208;), establishing a selective radical generation pathway and achieving &gt;99.9% removal of refractory pollutants (oxalic acid, atrazine) in 30 min with 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold enhancements over conventional AOPs. This work offers a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS control in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate critical redox processes in contaminant degradation, precise regulation of radical speciation remains fundamentally constrained by the heterogeneity in active site configurations and coordination microenvironments. Here, a site&#8208;specific engineering strategy is demonstrated through spatially organized Ca&#9472;O basic sites and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers, fabricated via Ca2+&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;linking of sodium alginate. Mechanistic studies reveal that the alkaline Ca&#9472;O domains enhance spin density of *OO intermediates to promote hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation, while adjacent acidic Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si moieties simultaneously lower *O formation energy barrier and suppress *OO conversion, establishing a selective radical generation pathway. This bifunctional design achieves near&#8208;complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of recalcitrant pollutants including oxalic acid and atrazine within 30&#160;min, demonstrating 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold rate enhancement over conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The engineered catalyst maintains stable efficiency over 20 cycles in actual wastewater treatment processes, providing a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS manipulation in water treatment.

A migratory animal&#8208;enlightened hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework nanorods electrodeposited nickel&#8208;based fabric is designed as an ultrafast and ultrasensitive dual&#8208;environmental magnetic field luminescent sensor both in air and water, which can be further utilized for underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air&#8208;underwater dual&#8208;environment magnetic intelligent real&#8208;time monitoring, providing a sufficient basis for the future application of luminescent magnetic sensors in the field of wireless communication, magnetic navigation, medical diagnosis, resource exploration, traffic engineering and environmental protection, etc.








Abstract
Migratory animals with magnetic receptors can sense the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon known as magnetoreception, and use it for long&#8208;distance navigation. Nevertheless, research on flexible luminescent magnetic sensors, particularly those suitable for both aerial and underwater environments, remains extremely underdeveloped. Herein, enlightened by the magnetic perception ability of migratory animals, an air and underwater dual&#8208;environment bionic luminescent magnetic sensor (HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric) is initiatively fabricated by electroplating hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;14) onto nickel&#8208;based conductive fabric via a coordinated electrodeposition method. In both air and underwater environments, HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric exhibits ultrafast response speed (40 and 240 ms), ultralow detection limit (0.0227 and 0.0337 mT), ultrahigh sensitivity (1510.23 and 51.89 T&#8722;1), ultrahigh measurement accuracy (relative standard deviation &#8804; 0.52% and 0.097%), and great repeatability (900 and 540 cycles), respectively. Finite element simulation analysis of displacement and magnetic flux density changes for HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric reveals that the magnetic response mechanism can be attributed to the magnetic&#8208;caused bending behavior resulting from magnetic attraction. Additionally, underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air&#8208;underwater dual&#8208;environment magnetic intelligent real&#8208;time monitoring are further materialized. This work opens up a brand&#8208;new path for the application of luminescent (fluorescent) sensors in the field of dual&#8208;environment magnetic sensing.

         <title>Valence and Site Engineering Enable Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at 960 nm in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Forsterite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent material (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr,5%Li) with efficient (EQE = 48%) ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM &#8776; 2413 cm&#8722;1 (226&#160;nm)) NIR emission at 960&#160;nm upon blue&#8208;light excitation. This innovation addresses the low efficiency of long&#8208;wavelength (&#955;max &gt; 900&#160;nm) NIR&#8208;emitting materials due to the radiationless de&#8208;activation and the low absorption efficiency of Cr3+ activators.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light sources hold great potential for applications in night vision illumination, bio&#8208;imaging, and non&#8208;destructive testing. However, radiationless de&#8208;activation and low absorption restrict the development of high&#8208;efficiency blue light excitable NIR phosphors, especially for emissions beyond 900&#160;nm. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cr3+&#8208;activated forsterite (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr3+, 5%Li+) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li+ as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr4+ formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr3+ d&#8208;d forbidden transitions in Mg2SiO4. More importantly, Li+ promotes excited&#8208;state energy transfer between Cr3+ emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non&#8208;destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.

Herein we report a high-performance Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated forsterite (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:1.5%Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, 5%Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; forbidden transitions in Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; promotes excited-state energy transfer between Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor-converted light-emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro-optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non-destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization Signal Amplification of 2D GeSe&#8208;Based Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based amplification circuit is developed to significantly enhance the polarization ratio (PR) of 2D GeSe polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, improving PR from 2.1 to 54.8 (over 25&#8208;fold enhancement). This amplified polarization signal directly contributes to higher recognition accuracy in defect detection systems, concurrently reducing the computational costs of convolutional neural networks (CNN)&#160;by over 60%.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on&#8208;chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation&#8208;dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization&#8208;induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT&#8208;Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high&#8208;PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aqueous Reforming of Methyl Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3d&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed photocatalyst, supported on modified g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;, facilitates the photocatalytic selective hydrogen (7.5 mmol gcat&#8722;1 of hydrogen; nothing else than H2 and CO2) generation from methyl formate. This diverse system functions under mild conditions, providing high hydrogen yield, selectivity, and enduring stability. Through characterization and mechanistic investigations uncover a radical approach, offering a sustainable foundation for the future advancement of liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technologies utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals.








Abstract
Green hydrogen is critical to establish a sustainable energy future as it offers a clean, renewable, and a versatile alternative for decarbonizing industries, transportation, and power generation. However, the limitations of current methods significantly restrict the scope and hinder many of the envisioned applications. This study aims to report on the first example of a 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based (Cu) heterogeneous photocatalytic system to produce green hydrogen via dehydrogenation of methyl formate (MF), a reaction previously known to require 4d/5d transition metals. Employing a Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalyst supported on aryl&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (d&#8208;gC3N4), the protocol offers numerous key advantages, including the recyclability of the photocatalyst for &gt;10 cycles without significant activity loss, sustained hydrogen production (&gt;15 days!) with high hydrogen yield (19.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1) and negligible CO emission, following an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient catalytic pathway. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is characterized (using HAADF&#8208;STEM, SS&#8208;NMR, XAS, EPR, and XPS), all of which clearly demonstrated the presence of single atomic Cu&#8208;site. Additionally, comprehensive mechanistic investigations together with DFT calculations allow for a thorough mechanistic rationale for this reaction. It is strongly believed that this atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalytic approach will open new avenues for establishing liquid organic hydrogen career (LOHC) technologies.

         <title>Switching off Competing Hydrogen Formation in CO2 Electroreduction via Substrate Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that graphitized carbon nanotubes enhance the selectivity of Ni phthalocyanine catalysts for CO2 reduction by preserving the Ni&#8208;N4 coordination structure. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory confirm that defect engineering suppresses hydrogen evolution. The findings highlight a cost&#8208;effective strategy for scalable, selective CO production using immobilized molecular catalysts.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used as supports for immobilizing molecular electrocatalysts, such as for CO2 reduction (CO2R), with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions often assumed to govern the catalyst immobilization. However, the nature of catalyst/CNTs interactions remains insufficiently understood. Here, nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) is investigated, a benchmark CO2R catalyst, supported on CNTs. NiPc preferentially anchors at defect&#8208;sites on CNTs rather than adsorbing uniformly via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking is found, an observation validated by theoretical simulations. Notably, CNTs with the fewest defects, despite exhibiting non&#8208;uniform NiPc distribution, deliver the highest CO2R activity and CO selectivity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that high defect densities induce D4h symmetry distortion of the NiPc macrocycle under cathodic bias, compromising catalyst integrity and CO2R performance. Guided by these insights, CNT defect density is optimized via thermal graphitization, yielding a NiPc/CNT composite with unprecedented selectivity (CO:H2 &gt; 16&#160;100:1) and a turnover frequency of 1072&#160;s&#8315;1 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus RHE, switching off the competing hydrogen formation. Integrated into a 100&#160;cm2 zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, the optimized catalyst sustains 50&#160;A current with &gt;95% CO selectivity at &#8776;3.5&#160;V, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ag&#8208;based systems. This work establishes CNT defect&#8208;engineering as an effective strategy for advancing molecular catalysts for CO2R electrolysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE&#8208;TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE&#8208;TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer&#8208;based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer&#8208;based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high&#8208;temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;temperature enhancing TENG (HTE&#8208;TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&#8722;2 under a 109 &#937; load.

     alt="High-Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE-TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE-TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer-based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer-based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high-temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high-temperature enhancing TENG (HTE-TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; load. This work provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to serve in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing Multicolor, 3D&#8208;Printable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence PLA Materials via Regulating the &#960;&#8208;System of Aryl&#8208;Annulated Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the &#960;&#8208; system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, full&#8208;color (440 &#8211; 628 nm) is achieved, ultralong lifetimes (251 &#8211; 3841 ms), and bright (&#934;pmax = 19%) RTP emission in PLA matrix, representing the best performance among reported PLA&#8208;based RTP materials. Leveraging the unique thermoplasticity of polymers, versatile RTP filaments are fabricated through extrusion processing and create intricate RTP objects via FDM printing or 3D printing pens.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based degradable organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) polymers should become a mainstream research topic in the future. Meanwhile, shaping URTP polymers into 3D&#8208;printable materials is of great significance for applications in optical and optoelectronic fields. Nevertheless, the fabrication of full&#8208;color, ultralong, bright, and 3D printable bio&#8208;based RTP polymer materials using a single&#8208;dopant component still faces significant challenges. Here, by regulating the &#960;&#8208;system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, the triplet energy levels are successfully regulated which enabled wavelength&#8208;tunable RTP emissions spanning from blue to red afterglow (440 &#8211; 628 nm) in PLA matrix. Non&#8208;radiative decay of dopant triplet excitons are effectively suppressed by the rigid environment of polymer matrix and dopant&#8208;polymer interactions. This enables the prepared PLA&#8208;based RTP materials exhibited ultralong lifetimes of 3.84 s and the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible afterglow duration up to 48 s. Recyclable and reprocessable RTP objects are fabricated via 3D printing and are successfully applied in the fields of artworks, monitoring and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This successfully expands the application of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials in 3D fields, and will promote the commercialization of RTP materials and the development of environmentally friendly ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Contact Transfer Epitaxy of Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing a halide perovskite thin film (donor) into contact with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of oriented perovskite nanocrystals (acceptor) at elevated temperature leads to epitaxial transfer of halide perovskite from the donor to the acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate controls the crystal orientation and grain size, while the donor substrate controls the composition.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials are very exciting because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and simple deposition with both solution and vapor&#8208;phase methods. Until now, solution deposition has received more attention, but there are growing indications that residual solvent may limit performance and in particular long&#8208;term stability. Evaporation is a promising alternative, but is more complicated to implement; it requires vacuum, multiple sources at different temperatures, is difficult to switch between different materials due to cross&#8208;contamination and typically leads to films with very small grain size. Here a novel contact transfer method is presented for fabricating single crystalline perovskites that maintains the simplicity and flexibility of solution deposition while avoiding the use of solvent. This contact transfer epitaxy method uses an acceptor substrate consisting of self&#8208;assembled perovskite nanocubes to control crystal orientation and a donor substrate of the desired perovskite film to determine the ultimate composition. By heating the two substrates under close contact in atmospheric conditions, the perovskite film is transferred from the donor to the acceptor substrate, showing cubic phase (100) orientation even with hexagonal donor films. It is shown that contact transfer epitaxy is compatible with a variety of compositions and does not require specialized evaporators or vacuum conditions.

         <title>Development of a Vaginal Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel for Combating Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.








Abstract
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is initiated by the hypoestrogenic state consequent to cessation of ovarian function and involves changes in all vaginal layers. These alterations include decreased epithelial proliferation and differentiation, impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, pro&#8208;inflammatory immune milieu, and smooth muscle atrophy. Patient satisfaction with existing treatments for GSM is low, due in part to their lack of therapeutic effect throughout all vaginal layers and reliance on hormonal treatments. Decellularized ECM therapeutics are known to facilitate soft tissue repair in a variety of applications. Thus, a porcine vaginal tissue&#8208;derived decellularized ECM (vECM) hydrogel suitable for noninvasive topical intravaginal administration is developed specifically for vaginal repair. When applied in a rat model of surgical menopause, vECM significantly improves vaginal epithelial thickness and epithelial stem cell phenotype. Despite topical intravaginal application, vECM is also observed in the lamina propria and fibromuscularis, exerting a regenerative effect on the vaginal smooth muscle layer. Furthermore, vECM modulates macrophage density and promotes pro&#8208;regenerative M2&#8208;like phenotype within the vaginal tissue. Overall, the work herein demonstrates a new nonhormonal biomaterial treatment that counteracts pathological vaginal alterations &#8211; a hallmark of GSM &#8211; in an established preclinical model of menopause.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Microwave&#8208;Assisted Volumetric Heating Engineered Defect&#8208;Free Ceria/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

This study proposes a transformative approach for fabricating highly dense and thin ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes for solid oxide electrochemical cells using microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering at unprecedentedly low temperatures and short processing times, achieving excellent performance and durability.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) hold significant promise as a sustainable energy conversion technology due to their high efficiency and minimal environmental impact. However, their development faces critical challenges, particularly in achieving dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes necessary to fully leverage state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cobaltite&#8208;based oxygen electrodes. In this study, a microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering process is successfully employed as a transformative alternative to the conventional, time&#8208;intensive sintering approach, enabling the fabrication of highly dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes. This innovative method reduced processing time by over 30&#8208;fold compared to convection sintering and achieved a record&#8208;low sintering temperature of 1200&#160;&#176;C. SOCs fabricated with these volumetric heating&#8208;engineered bilayer electrolytes demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance, delivering a maximum power density of 2.43&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.16&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 750&#160;&#176;C in electrolysis mode, alongside excellent long&#8208;term durability. Furthermore, advanced digital twin analysis revealed the critical correlation between microstructural features and electrochemical performance, providing new insights into SOC optimization. This work highlights the potential of microwave&#8208;assisted sintering as a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for advancing high&#8208;performance SOC technologies.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>de novo Fabrication of Dense Collagen Matrices with Patterned Hierarchical Structures for Corneal Stromal Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, it is reported that top&#8208;down inputs can be coupled with contextual cues control to guide the bottom&#8208;up assembly of collagen to form dense matrices with spatially&#8208;defined mesoscale structures: i) mild electrical inputs electro&#8208;assemble collagen molecules into a dense metastable state composed of partially assembled molten fibrils; ii) permissive contextual cues (especially controlled humidity) enable these molten fibrils to undergo further hierarchical assembly, to form a stable thickened fibril state; and iii) spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs can induce riboflavin&#8208;based photocrosslinking to locally trap the structure of metastable molten fibril state and yield a stable state with thin fibrils. This approach can de novo fabricate biomimetic patterned collagens (e.g., cornea&#8208;sclera structure). It is envisioned that this work provides a generic approach for controlling collagen's multiscale assembly for a broad range of biomedical applications.








Abstract
Collagen is a versatile biological building block that is guided by extracellular cues to self&#8208;assemble into diverse hierarchical structures that perform various tissue functions. Here, the use of top&#8208;down inputs and controlled contextual cues is reported for the de novo fabrication of patterned dense collagen matrices with spatially varying tailored mesoscale structures. Initially, imposed electrical inputs are used to guide collagen triple helix molecules to partially assemble into a dense metastable molten fibril state that can be induced by permissive contextual cues (especially humidity) to undergo further assembly. Spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs that induce riboflavin&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking can locally&#8208;trap partially assembled states (e.g., molten fibrils). To illustrate the potential of collagen patterning, a functional corneal stromal substitute is specifically fabricated that mimics the microstructures of collagen in cornea&#8208;sclera and demonstrates that it can restore histological structure and function in a corneal defect rabbit model. This generic approach for the de novo fabrication of mesoscale&#8208;structured collagen is envisioned to have broad applications in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled In&#8208;Operando Shape Reconfiguration, Fixation, and Recovery of Magnetically Actuated Microtextured Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds (DS&#8208;CAN) can rearrange its molecular topology through heating or UV irradiation. When combined with ferromagnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature enables contactless, spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic bond exchanges during magnetomechanical actuation. This approach enables 3D microfabrication with selective, chemical&#8208;free, reversible shape reconfiguration and fixation in dry conditions without physical contact.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide&#8208;bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV&#8208;assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above Tv. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high&#8208;temperature activation (&gt; Tv = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in&#8208;operando UV&#8208;fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on&#8208;demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder&#8208;free homologous shape&#8208;fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Center Exploration in Atomically Thin MoSxTe2&#8208;x Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering in a closed&#8208;loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoSxTe2&#8208;x alloy catalyst is created through low&#8208;temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 (S&#8208;MoTe2), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Teads&#8208;Mo). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half&#8208;reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S&#8208;MoTe2 alloy compared to its counterparts without Teads&#8208;Mo. This work provides an intelligent approach to facilitate active center exploration in micrographs and achieves a closed&#8208;loop verification for the ML&#8208;assisted defect discovery via theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, displaying how ML and researchers seamlessly cooperate in a scientific workflow for advanced catalyst development.

         <title>Sonodynamic and Bioorthogonal Sonocatalytic Thrombotic Therapy Based on AIE Cationic Tetranuclear Ir(III) Complex Nanoplatform Guided by NIR&#8208;Chemiluminescence Imaging</title>

AIE&#8208;active tetranuclear Ir(III) complex Ir&#8208;4 as a sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst is formulated into a nanoplatform with an H2S donor. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs achieves combined endogenous NIR chemiluminescence imaging, sonodynamic therapy and release of H2S in situ by a bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction in vivo, achieving safe thrombolysis and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive thrombolytic strategies include photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of PTT and PDT is impeded by the limited tissue penetration depth of the light source. SDT is a promising method due to the deeper tissue penetration and site&#8208;specific features of ultrasound; however, the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers has constrained its clinical use. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;triggered nanoparticles (NPs), named Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs, achieve a sonodynamic thrombolytic, bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction, with chemiluminescence (CL) imaging in the thrombus. An Ir(III) complex, named Ir&#8208;4, which has aggregation induced emission (AIE), combined with a hydrogen sulfide donor, named H2S&#8208;N3, provide the nanoplatform which is modified with the peptide c(RGDfC) to target the thrombus. This supramolecular assembly successfully integrates: i) thrombosis detection based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging, ii) sonodynamic thrombus therapy and iii) release of hydrogen sulfide for anti&#8208;inflammatory action. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs emit long&#8208;lasting NIR CL triggered by endogenous ONOO&#8722; and achieve 12&#160;mm deep tissue penetration. Blood clots are effectively removed and blood flow is almost fully restored in mouse carotid thrombus and rat femoral vein models. The work demonstrates a new integrated strategy for diagnosing and treating life&#8208;threatening diseases caused by thrombusotic disorders.

         <title>Granular Hydrogels as Brittle Yield Stress Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers yield stress fluid model can describe granular hydrogel deformation. The model robustly captures transient rheology and self&#8208;healing behavior for granular gels of varying composition using only six parameters. This framework provides new insight regarding the effect of material parameters on granular yielding and informs advanced applications such as extrusion&#8208;based granular (hydrogel) printing and material ageing/remodeling.








Abstract
While granular hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedical applications, methods to capture their rheological behavior generally consider shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing properties or produce ensemble metrics (e.g., dynamic moduli) while neglecting transient yielding and unyielding processes. Combining oscillatory shear testing with Brittility (Bt) via the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers (KDR) model, this work shows that granular hydrogels behave as brittle yield stress fluids. This work quantifies steady and transient rheology as a function of microgel properties and granular composition for polyethylene glycol and gelatin microgels. The KDR model with Bt captures granular hydrogel behavior for a wide range of design parameters, reducing the complex rheology to a determination of model parameters. In granular mixtures, this work observes monotonic dependencies of the elastic modulus, structural viscosity, and brittility upon granular composition, while the yield stress is lower for mixtures. Microgel size distribution and polymer fraction are the most influential parameters in monolithic granular hydrogels, while microgel size and packing density are less impactful. The model robustly captures self&#8208;healing behavior and reveals that granular hydrogel relaxation accelerates with an increased small&#8208;amplitude strain rate. This quantitative framework is an important step toward rational design of granular hydrogels for applications ranging from injection and in situ stabilization to 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Activatable Enzymatic Nanoplatform Incorporated into Microneedle Patch for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia Augmented Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Activatable enzymatic nanoplatform incorporated into microneedle patch is developed for relieving tumor hypoxia augmented photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
The clinical advancement of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces entrenched impediments, particularly the suboptimal solubility of hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) and tumor&#8208;associated hypoxia. Herein, a universally applicable, carrier&#8208;free nanotherapeutic platform is devised in which catalase (CAT) functions dually as a biocatalytic oxygenator and a biocompatible scaffold for PSs encapsulation. Through self&#8208;assembly with diverse hydrophobic PSs&#8212;including 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hexyloxyethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;divinyl&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (HPPH), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and zinc (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8212;CAT forms uniform and stable PS@CAT nanoparticles (NPs), obviating the necessity for supplementary nanocarriers. These nanostructures are embedded within microneedle (MN) patches, facilitating minimally invasive, spatially targeted transdermal administration. The PSs bind to the hydrophobic pocket of CAT within NPs, temporarily suppressing its bioactivity, which is restored upon NPs disassembly in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). This pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; mechanism orchestrates the synchronized release of PSs and reactivation of CAT, which catalyzes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) to generate oxygen (O2), alleviating hypoxia and augmenting O2 availability for PDT. In vivo validation in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model corroborated this approach's therapeutic superiority and biocompatibility. Collectively, the findings delineate a minimalist, multifunctional strategy to simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of PSs and overcome hypoxia in PDT for more efficacious oncologic therapy.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

Dynamic size&#8208;change nanovaccines (DashVax) overcome the lymphatic delivery paradox through programmed size transition. Constructed from dynamic covalent bonds, these 102 nm assemblies time&#8208;dependently disassemble into 5 nm subunits within LNs, leveraging large&#8208;particle drainage efficiency while enabling small&#8208;particle penetration through anatomical barriers. This dynamic size&#8208;change strategy achieves 7.3&#215; enhanced paracortical delivery, potentiating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppressing tumor growth in B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models.








Abstract
Breakthrough advances in nanotechnology have substantially enhanced lymph node (LN) targeting efficiency and immune cell uptake of nanovaccines, establishing novel avenues for tumor immunotherapy. Nevertheless, current nanovaccines predominantly accumulate in subcapsular sinuses (SCS) or superficial cortical regions post&#8208;lymphatic transport, failing to traverse anatomical barriers to reach the T cell&#8208;enriched paracortex&#8212;a critical delivery bottleneck that severely limits full activation of cellular immunity. Furthermore, the absence of tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli in LN microenvironments invalidates conventional environment&#8208;responsive delivery strategies. Herein, &#8220;dynamically size&#8208;change nanovaccine&#8221; (DashVax), a time&#8208;controlled self&#8208;disassembling nanovaccine is presented that achieves dynamic size transition from 102 to 5 nm via physiologically regulated imine bond hydrolysis. This design capitalizes on the lymphatic drainage superiority of large particles and tissue&#8208;penetrating capacity of small units, achieving a breakthrough 7.3&#8208;fold enhancement in paracortical antigen delivery compared to non&#8208;size&#8208;change nanovaccines (NoncVax). DashVax demonstrates&#160;robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and tumor growth suppression in both B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models. This exogenous stimulus&#8208;free temporal delivery strategy not only redefines nanovaccine design principles but also elucidates fundamental correlations between intranodal delivery kinetics and immune activation efficacy.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Mode Photothermal, Phase&#8208;Change, and Radiative&#8208;Cooling Film for All&#8208;Day Thermoelectric Generation</title>

Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Ti2O3/TiO2 composite shells are designed for LSPR modulation. MPCMs have full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional tri&#8208;mode photothermal, phase&#8208;change, and radiative&#8208;cooling film is developed for efficient solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric (STE) energy conversion. The MPCMs and composite films provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced STE conversion applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric conversion shows great promise, especially in off&#8208;grid aerospace and navigation. However, low output density and intermittency of solar energy limit its application. Herein, a microencapsulated phase change material (MPCMs) is designed with a n&#8208;Tetracosane core and TiO2/Ti2O3 composite shell to address the above issue. The MPCM exhibits a latent heat of 144.5 J&#160;g&#8722;1, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.7% and 100% energy storage capacity. The thermoelectric system resulting from coupling the multifunctional film composed of polydimethylsiloxane and MPCMs with the thermoelectric module is capable of successfully achieving adaptive 24&#160;h uninterrupted power generation on account of its functions of photothermal conversion, energy storage, and radiative cooling. The output power density of the TES ranged from 6.1 to 21.1&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 at light intensities of 1000&#8211;5000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. The material design innovatively endows a single material with the functions of photothermal conversion, phase change energy storage, and radiative cooling, making it can adaptively harvest energy from both the sun and cold space. This multifunctional material offers new insights into the repeatable storage and high&#8208;quality utilization of solar energy, holding significant scientific implications for the development of all&#8208;day solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric power generation technology.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Elastomer with High Luminescent and Mechanical Performances Enabled by Multiple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.

         <title>A Gas Nanobomb to Promote Drug Penetration and Amplify TACE Therapy for Orthotopic Liver Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional embolic agent is successfully synthesized with the introduction of magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanoparticles into lipiodol (Lip) &amp;tirapazamine (TPZ) dispersion for efficient supply H2, OH&#8722;, and Mg2+. The L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension demonstrates effective elimination of primary tumors, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and recurrence when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transarterial embolization by L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.








Abstract
The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH2) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co&#8208;dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH2 nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH2 nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&#8722; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H2) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen&#8208;based chemotherapy; and Mg2+ synergistically regulates T&#8208;cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H2 and Mg2+&#8208;induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH2 nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.

The in situ electrogenerated adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) species effectively capture OH&#8722; ions, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface. This promotes a self&#8208;sustaining cycle between Fe2+ad release and &#945;&#8208;FeOOH reconstruction, endowing the electrocatalyst with both high NH3 selectivity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The high performance of Fe&#8208;based electrocatalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction to ammonia (eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) is currently constrained by low NH3 selectivity and insufficient stability under high current density. Hence, the incorporation of ruthenium single&#8208;atom into the CuFe2O4 (RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4) with self&#8208;recycling property is developed. The Cu and Ru sites synergistically promote the water dissociation and facilitate the redeposition of in situ adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) as &#945;&#8208;FeOOH by self&#8208;reinforcing local alkalinity at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface, thereby achieving high activity and robust stability for eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. The optimized RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 delivers excellent performance with a 97.9% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and 99.8% NH3 selectivity at &#8722;0.59&#160;V versus RHE in neutral electrolyte. Remarkably, in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system, it achieves a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.5&#160;V with robust stability, accompanied by &gt;95% NH3 selectivity, a nitrate removal rate of 4.17&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an NH3 production rate of 3.97&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Ru site in the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 significantly enhances NO3&#8722; adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for the potential determining step (*HNO2 &#8594; *NO). This work offers valuable insights into designing autonomous local alkalinity microenvironments with self&#8208;recycling properties on cost&#8208;effective Cu/Fe oxides.

         <title>Resonator&#8208;Free Metamaterials Based on Ferromagnetic Dielectrics for Mandatory Microwave Loss and Compact Stealth Cloaks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic dielectric metamaterials are constructed by arranging ferromagnetic dielectric units composed of CIPs and PU. The incident wave is transformed into a surface wave crawling along the metamaterial by adjusting the phase gradient and unit size. In addition, due to the microwave attenuation effect of the ferromagnetic dielectric, the surface wave is lost secondarily.








Abstract
The utilization of resonant&#8208;unit&#8208;based metamaterials in beam control and compact stealth applications is inherently limited by the strong correlation between unit in&#8208;plane dimensions and reflection characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes a resonator&#8208;free metamaterial based on ferromagnetic dielectric that decouples the amplitude and phase by regulating interface interference, thereby achieving phase modulation independent of the in&#8208;plane dimensions of the FD units. With the introduction of a constant phase gradient and tuning of unit dimensions, reflected waves can be deflected or even converted into surface waves that propagate along the metamaterial interface. This enables a novel electromagnetic loss mechanism wherein the reflected energy undergoes mandatory attenuation by horizontally propagating within the lossy ferromagnetic dielectric. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove this phenomenon, yielding an improvement of 36.64% in the average power loss density, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;52&#160;dB. Further, the efficacy of ferromagnetic dielectric units is validated for compact stealth cloaks, and a conformal curved stealth strategy that requires only unit dimension tuning to achieve scattering&#8208;field camouflage for arbitrarily shaped targets is proposed. Given its resonator&#8208;independent operation, the proposed metamaterial exhibits miniaturization advantages of cross&#8208;scale downsizing (in&#8208;plane dimension &lt; &#955;/12)&#8212;a critical advancement for compact electromagnetic defense systems.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Chelating and ROS&#8208;Scavenging Polymers with Thioketal and Thioether Bonds Delivering Ferroptosis Inhibitor Lip&#8208;1 Provide a Triple Therapeutic Strategy for Retina Ganglion Cells in Acute Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip&#8208;1 into NPsLip&#8208;1. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip&#8208;1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.








Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron&#8208;chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip&#8208;1 are designed and self&#8208;assembled into NPsLip&#8208;1, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPsLip1 by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip&#8208;1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip&#8208;1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPsLip&#8208;1 with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPsLip&#8208;1 effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPsLip&#8208;1 provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.

         <title>A GaN Schottky Barrier Diode&#8208;Based Terahertz Metasurface for High&#8208;Precision Phase Control and High&#8208;Speed Beam Scanning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable terahertz metasurface based on gallium nitride Schottky barrier diodes is demonstrated. By tuning antenna resonance via junction capacitance, the metasurface achieves high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;precision, and fast&#8208;response continuous phase modulation over a wide range. Dual&#8208;mode (analog/digital) operation enables &#177;45&#176; beam scanning with flat gain, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation THz communication and sensing.








Abstract
Effective wavefront control in the terahertz (THz) regime is essential for achieving high&#8208;directionality beamforming, spatial multiplexing, and real&#8208;time wireless communication. However, low&#8208;loss, precise, and rapid THz phase modulation remains fundamentally constrained by material limitations and inherent device&#8208;level trade&#8208;offs. A programmable THz metasurface (GaNMS) is presented, employing a gallium nitride Schottky barrier diode with a high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas, specifically designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging its low insertion loss, fast response, and continuously tunable junction capacitance. A 32 &#215; 25&#8208;element array is designed and fabricated. Each unit cell functions as a direct THz phase shifter, dynamically tuning the junction capacitance to enable continuous phase modulation from 0&#176; to 210&#176; at 0.32 THz, with a 1.8&#176; average phase error, modulation speed exceeding 200&#160;MHz, and &#8776;5&#160;dB average insertion loss. To mitigate array&#8208;level nonuniformities, a differential evolution&#8208;based optimization algorithm is introduced, enabling robust &#177;45&#176; beam scanning in both analog and digital modes, with main lobe gains of 18.5 and 16 dBi, respectively. An integrated GaNMS&#8208;based sensing and communication system is also demonstrated, validating its potential in next&#8208;generation THz applications. The proposed GaNMS bridges device&#8208;level phase tunability and system&#8208;level functionality, enabling practical THz technologies.

         <title>Scalable Production of 24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow Plastics Through Molecular Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;H&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) plastics are fabricated at a large scale through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials can be activated by natural sunlight, highlighting their practical utility for engineering applications.








Abstract
The development of polymeric afterglow materials has garnered significant interest due to their promising applications in sensing technologies, smart devices, and optoelectronic systems. However, conventional engineering plastics typically exhibit limited afterglow properties owing to rapid nonradiative decay processes under ambient conditions. This study presents a breakthrough in the fabrication of plastics with 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) properties through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. By utilizing aromatic plastics as electron acceptor and the matrix, spirofluorene derivatives are incorporated as electron donors and chromophore dopants via a melt blending technique, a widely established method in polymer manufacturing. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions. At 4&#160;&#176;C, the HLA lasted for up to 100 h after ceasing photoexcitation, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials could be activated by natural sunlight and maintain a visible green afterglow for 5 h in ambient air. Mechanism studies revealed that the HLA phenomenon is associated with the formation of donor/acceptor exciplexes upon photoexcitation. Additionally, the HLA plastics exhibited exceptional mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, making them highly suitable for advanced applications in flexible displays and next&#8208;generation wearable technologies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;polarized Acidic Water Electrolysis with Antenna&#8208;Reactor Plasmonic Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral plasmonic antenna&#8211;reactor electrocatalyst, integrating Au nanoflowers as the antenna and iridium single atoms as the reactor, achieves spin&#8208;polarized and light&#8208;driven water electrolysis in acidic media. The catalyst exhibits high activity and durability, enabled by hot&#8208;carrier transfer and the CISS effect, as supported by operando spectroscopy and DFT simulations.









Abstract

Water electrolysis, driven by renewable electricity, offers a sustainable path for hydrogen production. However, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotentials of both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. To address this, a novel catalyst system is developed integrating plasmonic nanoreactors with chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. In this system, chiral Au nanoparticles act as antennae, while single&#8208;atom iridium serves as the catalytic reactor, achieving a 3.5 fold increase in reaction kinetics (at 1.57&#160;V vs RHE) compared to commercial IrO2 catalysts and enhancing durability by over 4.8 times relative to conventional Pt/C || IrO2 systems. Density functional theory and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that plasmon&#8208;driven spin alignment polarizes the Ir atom, significantly enhancing stability (&gt;480 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) under acidic conditions. This work represents a major advance in spin polarization for plasmonic electrocatalysis, offering a new route to sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Highly Responsive Self&#8208;Healing and Degradable Piezoelectric Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a self&#8208;healing and stretchable material is used to develop a damage resistant energy harvester capable of powering electric bulbs, and a sensing system to intelligently classify biomechanical activities is represented.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials that are simultaneously healable, stretchable, and degradable have remained an unmet challenge, limiting advancements in wearable and implantable electronics, where devices face multidimensional mechanical deformation, causing a risk of damage. To address this critical gap, a biocompatible piezoelectric material is developed for ultrahigh piezoelectric effects with DL&#8208;alanine amino acid crystals, which is stretchable, healable, and degradable. The in situ grown DL&#8208;alanine piezoelectric crystals within an ionically cross&#8208;linked gelatin hydrogel matrix strengthen the piezoelectric properties with an ultrahigh voltage coefficient of 1.6 Vm&#160;N&#8722;1. The combination of the piezo&#8208;ionic property and crystal alignment results in a record&#8208;breaking energy harvesting figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value at 57.6 pm2&#160;N&#8722;1 to deliver outstanding mili&#8208;watt level power outputs in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices which can power up even several electric light bulbs. An elastically stretchable, damage resistant strain sensor is further optimized for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring and biomechanical motion tracking. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the sensing system intelligently classifies biomechanical activities with high accuracy, enabling advanced applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports monitoring.

         <title>Immobilizing Lead and Healing Surface Defects via Perfluorinated Tertiary Amine Molecules Enables High&#8208;Performance Sustainable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorination strategy using perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) enables simultaneous surface defect passivation and lead immobilization in inverted perovskite solar cells. This approach yields a certified efficiency of 26.65% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability, offering a promising route toward high&#8208;performance and environmentally sustainable perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
The intrinsic instability and nonradiative recombination induced by surface defects hinder the further development of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Simultaneously, the commercial application of inverted PSCs is limited by environmental unfriendliness resulting from lead leakage. Herein, a universal perfluorination strategy is reported to immobilize lead and passivate surface defects of perovskite films in inverted PSCs. It is demonstrated that perfluorinated perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) can form PFTEA&#183;PbI2 complex with PbI2 via a strong coordination bond, which is favorable for suppressing lead leakage and promoting defect passivation. Due to much reduced surface nonradiative recombination, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated inverted PSCs deliver a fascinating certified stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, a record efficiency value reported for PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation technique. Moreover, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated devices maintain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work provides a simple and effective avenue to advance the sustainable development of inverted photovoltaic technology through a perfluorination strategy.

         <title>Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment strategy of spin&#8208;coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI2 as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post&#8208;treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI2 on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI2) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI2 that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long&#8208;term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs3ErCl6 quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post&#8208;treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI2 can react with Cs3ErCl6 QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI2.

     alt="Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pretreatment strategy of spin-coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post-treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long-term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ErCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post-treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can react with Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ErCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The pretreated perovskite layer has a better&#160;fit grain, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability of the device. The (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;(MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cell treated using the pretreatment method demonstrates a champion PCE of 26.01%. This work offers new perspectives for inhibiting excessive PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; growth and thus holds great promise for advancing the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells and contributing to the future landscape of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoporous Hydrogels with Tunable Pore Size for Efficient Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous hydrogels with tunable pore sizes ranging from 78 to 161&#160;nm are developed using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy. The structural integrity of the hydrogel nanochannels under hydrated conditions is confirmed via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. This work establishes a direct correlation between reduced pore size and enhanced streaming potential, providing new insights into the design of efficient hydrovoltaic materials.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators represent an emerging technology for converting low&#8208;grade water&#8208;based energy into electricity, and hydrogels are favored for their water absorption and ion&#8208;responsive properties. However, the controllable fabrication and precise micromorphological characterization of nanoporous hydrogels remain challenging, hindering the understanding of ion transport within confined water channels. In this work, a nanoporous hydrogel with tunable pore sizes is presented, developed through a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy using &#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes. The pore size can be systematically tuned from 78 to 161&#160;nm, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy confirms the presence of hydrated nanochannels. The results highlight the critical role of streaming potential in electricity generation, with the device achieving a threefold increase in voltage by reducing the pore size. The optimized device delivers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.05&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 100&#160;&#181;A with a 0.1&#160;m NaCl droplet. Moreover,a practical application is demonstrated through a sweat&#8208;monitoring patch that visually responds to ion concentration changes. This work advances the design of high&#8208;efficiency hydrovoltaic systems by establishing a clear link between tunable nanoscale architecture and device performance, paving the way for scalable energy harvesting and sensing technologies.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Matched Iridium on Vanadium Nitride as Efficient Hydrogen Electrocatalyst</title>

A lattice&#8208;matched molten co&#8208;growth strategy for constructing a controllable Ir structure with preferential active facet exposure on VN support, realizing highly efficient HOR/HER catalysis.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir), with optimal hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl bonding energy (OHBE), is considered a promising platform for achieving bi&#8208;directional hydrogen catalysis. However, traditional Ir&#8208;based catalysts with multiple crystalline facets exhibit a gap between the apparent activity and theoretical value, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, a molten co&#8208;growth process of Ir and vanadium nitride (Ir&#8208;VN) is reported, realizing precise exposure of lattice&#8208;matched Ir (111) on VN with optimal HBE and OHBE, for highly active hydrogen catalysis. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst demonstrates exceptional HOR activity with exchange currents 1.8&#8211;4.8 times higher than those of noble metal benchmark catalysts, as well as improved durability and CO tolerance. The unique lattice&#8208;matching effect promotes the directional electron transfer and induces shortened Ir&#9472;Ir bonds via the strongly coupled interface, therefore resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;CO capability. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst also demonstrates great HER activity and operational durability in a wide pH range, requiring only 21, 12, and 82&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, respectively. This work not only deepens the understanding of hydrogen electrocatalysis mechanisms but also inspires the rational design and controllable synthesis of catalysts with active crystal facets for various applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Poly(Urea&#8208;Urethane) Plastics With Superior Impact Resistance for Cryogenic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra&#8208;tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low&#8208;temperature impact resistance.








Abstract
Traditional impact&#8208;resistant plastics become brittle at low temperatures due to restricted polymer chain mobility, rendering them unsuitable for cryogenic applications. Developing ultra&#8208;tough plastics with superior impact resistance under extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, this study reports the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) plastics by cross&#8208;linking soft poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG) chains through multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with varying binding energies. The PUU plastic features a bicontinuous phase&#8208;separated nanostructure, where hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked, rigid yet deformable domains are interpenetrated with soft PTMEG chains. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical properties comparable to those of ultra&#8208;tough, high&#8208;strength plastics at ambient temperature, with yield strength of 81.1&#160;MPa, breaking strength of 133.0&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of 1.5&#160;GPa, and breaking strain of 220.9%. A 0.3&#8208;mm&#8208;thick sample achieves a maximum impact force of 667.8 N and an impact energy of 3.8 J at &#8722;50 &#176;C, while maintaining exceptional mechanical robustness and flexibility even at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The low&#8208;temperature toughness and impact resistance of the PUU plastics surpass those of existing impact&#8208;resistant plastics. This study demonstrates that hydrogen bonds with a broad spectrum of binding energies serve as ideal cross&#8208;links for fabricating ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant plastics suitable for cryogenic applications.
