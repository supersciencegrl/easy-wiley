         <title>Vertical Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Arrays for Page&#8208;Wise Parallel Logic and Arithmetic Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a page&#8208;wise logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory architecture realized in a 3D vertical resistvie random&#8208;access memory array of self&#8208;rectifying memristors. By introducing intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;page logic primitives, the system enables Boolean and arithmetic operations to be executed directly within the memory. A memristive arithmetic logic unit is experimentally demonstrated, including a compact 2&#8208;bit full&#8208;adder, validating high reproducibility and reduced spatiotemporal cost. These results establish a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient pathway toward in&#8208;memory computing with vertical memristive arrays.








Abstract
Logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory (LIM) architectures are explored to address the data transfer bottleneck of conventional von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within memory arrays. Among various candidates, memristor&#8208;based LIM systems have gained significant attention due to their non&#8208;volatile switching behavior and compatibility with dense integration. In this work, a page&#8208;wise LIM architecture is implemented using a 3D vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory array composed of self&#8208;rectifying Pt&#8211;Ta2O5&#8211;Al:HfO2&#8211;TiN memristors. Two logic primitives&#8212;1&#160;M and 2&#160;M logic&#8212;are employed to perform intra&#8208;page and inter&#8208;page operations, respectively, enabling core Boolean functions to be executed entirely within the array through resistive state transitions. Based on these logic operations, a memristive arithmetic logic unit (mALU) is designed to perform essential arithmetic functions, including addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement. Owing to the vertical structure of vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory, a 2&#8208;bit full adder is implemented with a footprint of only three cells and completed in 12 steps. The proposed intra&#8208;and inter&#8208;page operations, along with complete mALU functionality, are experimentally demonstrated with high reproducibility. Combined with significantly reduced spatiotemporal cost, these results highlight the promise of this architecture for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Field Induced Half Quantized Hall Conductivity in Trilayer Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;quantized Hall conductivity (hQHC) is reported in trilayer magnetic topological insulators driven by in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Distinct anisotropy energies of Cr&#8208; and V&#8208;doped layers enable tunable magnetization, stabilizing hQHC states. Angle&#8208;resolved transport and modeling reveal spacer thickness and temperature effects, establishing trilayer heterostructures as a platform to probe parity anomaly and engineer topological quantum devices.








Abstract
The parity anomaly originates in high&#8208;energy physics as a property of (2 + 1)&#8208;dimensional gauge theory. In condensed matter, it manifests through the physics of a single Dirac cone and with the transport signature of a half&#8208;quantized Hall conductivity (hQHC). Here, a new route is reported to achieve hQHC in trilayer magnetic topological insulators with different magnetic dopants on the top and bottom surfaces under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Additionally, angle&#8208;resolved magneto&#8208;transport measurements provide detailed information on the different perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energies of top and bottom surface magnetism and offer insights into the manipulation of the topological magnetoelectric effect via field orientation. The interlayer exchange coupling can be further tuned by non&#8208;magnetic spacer thickness, offering a technical pathway to stabilize a single Dirac cone with hQHC for investigating the parity anomaly and designing novel topological quantum devices.

         <title>Dual Dynamics Engineering in COF@MOF Enabled by Laser&#8208;Embedded Metallic Clusters for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk embedding of laser&#8208;generated metal clusters in covalent organic framework@metal&#8211;organic framework hybrids simultaneously overcomes the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers in photocatalytic hydrogenation, achieving nearly 100% conversion for selective C&#9552;O reduction and record&#8208;high hydrogen production rates, with general applicability to other metallic clusters and heterostructures.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogenation can convert solar and biomass resources into value&#8208;added chemicals but is hindered by sluggish CO reduction and inadequate photogenerated&#8208;carrier dynamics. Here, bulk embedding of laser&#8208;derived metal clusters into covalent organic framework@metalorganic framework (COF@MOF) hybrids is proposed and validated to overcome these challenges, a process in which the generated active hydrogen species enable near 100% selective hydrogenation of the C&#9472;O bond. In situ laser embedding enables spatial control of clusters within the COF bulk and COF@MOF interfaces, promoting CO over CC reduction. Bulk&#8208;embedded Pt clusters serve as sites on preformed MOF to nucleate COF growth, forming physical and carrier transfer bridges at the heterointerface via optimized band alignment. By virtue of the dual dynamics improvement, present work achieves an unprecedented yield of 100% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, which is so far the highest value among all furfural hydrogenation catalysts. Further control over the loading of Pt clusters leads to hydrogen production rates up to 125.48 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, solidifying its status as the most active Pt&#8208;based photocatalytic system reported to date. This dual&#8208;dynamics strategy is general and easily adaptable to diverse metallic clusters and heterostructures, offering a versatile route to boost photocatalytic hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Tandem Solar Cells With Conformal Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite on Fully Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables conformal deposition of perovskite via solution&#8208;processing on industrially textured silicon bottom cells. The regulated ratio of cesium in perovskite results in a uniform and fully covered thin film over large&#8208;scale pyramidal textures on silicon bottom cells based on hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon tunneling junctions. This approach enables perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with a certified efficiency of 32.94%.








Abstract
Conformal deposition of perovskite on fully textured silicon bottom cells using low&#8208;cost solution processing remains challenging, limiting the process compatibility and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Herein, this challenge through synergetic engineering of the perovskite composition and tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) is addressed. The utilization of wide bandgap perovskite with high cesium content and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) bottom cell with hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc&#8208;Si:H) TRJ is found to enable conformal perovskite on fully textured SHJ bottom cells using solution processing. A remarkable PCE of 33.38% (certified 32.94%) is achieved for the tandem, featuring a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 21.21&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The tandem displays excellent stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 2324&#160;h of operation at maximum power point (AM 1.5G, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Stabilizing Frustrated Phase Transitions in Selective Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multimodal operando spectromicroscopy, the frustrated phase transition responsible for selective oxidation over cobalt oxide spinel catalysts is identified, corresponding to combined surface reaction and Mars&#8208;van Krevelen (MvK) dynamics. This regime is disrupted by the formation of mobile vacancies and the depletion of active oxygen at high temperatures. Co&#8208;feeding water vapor mitigates these effects, thereby enhancing both selectivity and lifetime.








Abstract
Frustrated phase transitions represent the ideal working state of a heterogeneous catalyst. These states exist within a narrow parameter window, making them difficult to stabilize. Here, it is shown for the selective oxidation of 2&#8208;propanol to acetone over Co3O4 spinels that the addition of water extends the stability regime of the relevant frustrated phase transition. This conclusion is based on results obtained from multi&#8208;modal experiments, including operando scanning electron microscopy (OSEM), near ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP&#8208;XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and computer vision analysis. It is found that the most selective state for acetone formation coincides with a dynamic spinel structure that fluctuates through reversible redox processes. At elevated temperatures, this metastable state undergoes a complete phase transition into the rock&#8208;salt CoO phase characterized by low acetone selectivity. This process is found to be mediated by the generation of mobile vacancies. The addition of water vapor mitigates vacancy mobility and stabilizes the selective, but thermodynamically frustrated, state. As such, the study conceptualizes a strategy to extend the lifetime of a catalyst during reaction by the adequate addition of a co&#8208;reactant.

         <title>Giga&#8208;Voxel Multiscale Composite Architecture Mirrored Through a Data&#8208;to&#8208;Model Closed&#8208;Loop Digital Twin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models is presented, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8211;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8211;up data&#8208;driven voxel generation.








Abstract
Giga&#8208;voxel digital models offer abundant geometric detail; however, no mainstream method currently exists to efficiently distribute individual voxels across massive image volumes, and designing complex anisotropic composite materials remains infeasible due to the absence of promising methods. Herein, we propose a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8208;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8208;up data&#8208;driven generation. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of micro&#8208;digital representations as foundational building blocks within a continuum of digital assembly processes tailored for mesostructural models. Utilizing 3D image data, specifically X&#8208;ray tomography, our data&#8208;driven modeling meticulously characterizes the geometric attributes of the experimentally observed objects, thereby facilitating the creation of digital unit twins, each endowed with distinct identities assigned through a random seed generation. The closed&#8208;loop system provides feedback mechanism between data and model to ensure the 3D quality of the generated models. For hierarchical organization at the giga&#8208;voxel level, the digital unit twins are methodically expanded into cohesive 3D architectures based on assembly relationship at length scales of more than four orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this hierarchical model provides intricate insight into micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro geometrics while preserving the intrinsic microstructure.

         <title>Graphene Liquid Cells for In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy: Unveiling Nanomaterial Growth and Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how graphene liquid cells (GLCs) enable in situ transmission electron microscopy of nanomaterial growth and etching. It presents strategies for preparing suspended graphene, diverse routes for fabricating GLCs, and representative applications in monitoring dynamic nanoscale transformations. The discussion provides insights into opportunities and challenges of advancing GLC&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase studies.








Abstract
The liquid&#8208;phase growth and etching process of nanomaterials profoundly affects their size, morphology, and composition, thereby determining their properties. Achieving real&#8208;time atomic&#8208;resolution visualization of these processes has driven the development of in situ liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy imaging. Especially, graphene liquid cells (GLCs) have emerged as a powerful platform due to their high resolution, facile fabrication, and compatibility with conventional transmission electron microscopy holders. This review first summarizes the preparation of suspended graphene, the key window material for GLCs, and the fabrication of GLCs with diverse configurations. It then systematically outlines the applications of GLCs in revealing the growth and etching processes of nanomaterials, and finally concludes with perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with GLC&#8208;based research. This review aims to provide a panoramic understanding and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>The Promise of Solid Lubricants for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lubricants are vital for technology, saving energy and resources. The industry seeks sustainable solutions beyond fossil fuels. Solid lubricants offer extremely low friction and reduce environmental impact, especially in harsh conditions. Can these solids truly replace liquid lubricants, or are they limited to extreme applications? Explore the status and prospects of solid lubricants for a greener future.








Abstract
There's no question that lubricants will become more crucial in a world where technology plays an ever&#8208;more&#8208;important role. Lubricants save vast amounts of energy and material resources by reducing friction and increasing the lifetime of devices. It is no surprise that the lubrication industry is one of the largest in the world. The climate crisis demands solutions independent of non&#8208;renewable fossil energy, from which most of the liquid lubricants are extracted. Solid lubricants are the focus of the research community because they provide extremely low friction with a potentially much lower environmental impact. They are used when the operating conditions of machines do not allow the use of liquids, such as in a high temperature or vacuum environment, or when contamination mitigation is critical. The future of solid lubricants is bright. Can they truly be a direct substitute for liquid lubricants in certain applications, as many researchers claim, or will they be used only for applications where operating conditions are too harsh? In this perspective, the status and prospects of several classes of solid lubricants for greener and more effective lubrication are critically reviewed, with the hope that they can help us achieve the sustainability goals for the planet.

         <title>Transistor&#8208;Level Activation Functions via Two&#8208;Gate Designs: From Analog Sigmoid and Gaussian Control to Real&#8208;Time Hardware Demonstrations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screen gate&#8208;based transistors are presented, enabling tunable analog sigmoid and Gaussian activations. The SA&#8208;transistor improves MRI classification accuracy, while the GA&#8208;transistor supports precise Gaussian kernel tuning for forecasting. Both functions are implemented in a single device, offering compact, energy&#8208;efficient analog AI processing solutions.








Abstract
Tunable analog activation functions are essential for energy&#8208;efficient artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Two transistor designs are presented: the sigmoid&#8208;like activation function transistor (SA&#8208;transistor) and the Gaussian&#8208;like activation function transistor (GA&#8208;transistor), which implement analog sigmoid and Gaussian functions using a screen gate structure. In the SA&#8208;transistor, adjusting the screen gate voltage (VScreen&#8208;G) enables precise control of the sigmoid slope and saturation level. In the GA&#8208;transistor, the amplitude and standard deviation of the Gaussian response are tunable through the same mechanism. These transistors enable precise and continuous tuning of analog activation parameters such as slope, amplitude, and width at the device level. This controllability allows hardware&#8208;optimized neural computations tailored to specific tasks or datasets. Applied in real&#8208;world tasks, the SA&#8208;transistor improved lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification accuracy from 77% to 84%, and the GA&#8208;transistor raised the time&#8208;series forecasting coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.82 to 0.93. Furthermore, by assembling these devices into a hardware&#8208;based multilayer perceptron (MLP), robust inference is demonstrated on the IRIS dataset with 96.7% overall accuracy. This system&#8208;level validation highlights that analog activation transistors can directly support neuromorphic accelerators without digital post&#8208;processing, reducing circuit complexity and power consumption while maintaining high classification fidelity.

A novel oxygenated Linker of giant acceptor modulates molecular&#8208;crystallization kinetics for high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;halogenated&#8208;processed organic solar cells and modules.








Abstract
The use of low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point halogenated solvents is common in lab&#8208;scale organic solar cell (OSC) fabrication to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), but their high volatility hinders large&#8208;scale fabrication. High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are adopted as alternatives, but they often result in significant efficiency losses due to inferior morphology. In this work, toluene is adopted, enabling scalable production without any post&#8208;treatment. Two giant guest acceptors, featuring distinct oxygenated side chains, are introduced to modulate pre&#8208;aggregation in solution and crystallization kinetics within the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. The incorporation of giant acceptors effectively inhibits rapid acceptor aggregation and promotes smaller phase separation. Moreover, G&#8208;1O with a shorter oxygenated side chain yields more homogeneous phase separation, whereas G&#8208;3O with a longer side chain leads to uneven separation. Therefore, the G&#8208;1O&#8208;based ternary device achieves an outstanding PCE of 20.02%. Notably, a high PCE of 16.97% is also obtained in a large&#8208;area module (15.6 cm2, without dead zone). These findings highlight the critical role of oxygenated side&#8208;chain engineering in guest molecules for tuning crystallization kinetics under toluene processing.

High-boiling-point, non-halogenated solvents are adopted as alternatives, but they often result in significant efficiency losses due to inferior morphology.

Two giant guest acceptors, featuring distinct oxygenated side chains, are introduced to modulate pre-aggregation in solution and crystallization kinetics within the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend. The incorporation of giant acceptors effectively inhibits rapid acceptor aggregation and promotes smaller phase separation. Moreover, G-1O with a shorter oxygenated side chain yields more homogeneous phase separation, whereas G-3O with a longer side chain leads to uneven separation. Therefore, the G-1O-based ternary device achieves an outstanding PCE of 20.02%.

         <title>Evidence of n&#8208;type Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lack of control in charge carrier type and concentration in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) limits its application as a high thermal conductivity semiconductor. Evidence of n&#8208;type behavior in boron arsenide crystals is shown. They are prepared by an improved growth process, reducing compensating impurities. Defect analysis revealed that silicon&#8208;substituted boron is a potential donor in BAs.








Abstract
Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) is a recently emerging semiconductor that has exceedingly high thermal conductivity. However, the lack of charge carrier concentration control in cubic BAs is a significant hindrance to its application in electronic devices. As&#8208;grown micro crystals of BAs are reported to be unintentionally p&#8208;type. Here, the evidence of inhomogeneous n&#8208;type behavior in BAs crystals grown by an improved growth process reducing the impurities is present. Local n&#8208;type doping is confirmed by four methods: current&#8208;voltage measurement, scanning photocurrent microscopy, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, and Hall effect. Their analysis enables the formulation of a model describing BAs band bending on contacts and bias. Analysis of scanning photocurrent microscopy reveals that the diffusion length of minority carriers in BAs is substantial, reaching 33&#160;&#181;m. Defect analysis performed by current transient spectroscopy, photo&#8208;induced current transient spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that silicon&#8208;substituted boron is a candidate for a donor in BAs. Presented results show the perspective for bipolar control of charge carrier type in BAs and consequently its application in better thermally managed microelectronics.

         <title>Defect Engineering in &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se Heterostructures for High&#8208;Resolution Phototransistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heterojunction &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se with atomically sharp interfaces is created to suppress interface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with a tunable photoresponse, achieving significantly improved optoelectronic performance. Furthermore, a high&#8208;resolution phototransistor array is fabricated via thermal scanning probe lithography and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated.








Abstract
Analogous to the pivotal SiO2/Si junction in modern electronics, the &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se architecture has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of electronic devices. However, its potential to improve the optoelectronic properties of Bi2O2Se, such as responsivity and detectivity, remains unexplored. The photodetection performance of Bi2O2Se is primarily limited by intrinsic selenium vacancies at its surface, which lead to low photocurrent and instability. To address this, a defect&#8208;engineered &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterojunction is constructed with an atomically sharp interface via a developed UV&#8208;assisted oxidation strategy. This heterostructure successfully suppresses surface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation, resulting in substantially enhanced optoelectronic performance. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm a stable type&#8208;II band alignment with interfacial transitions enabling efficient carrier dissociation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 further enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with dynamically tunable photoresponse, achieving the largely improved metrics of responsivity (1.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1), detectivity (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones), and on/off ratio (2.3&#160;&#215; 106). Additionally, by using thermal scanning probe lithography, a high&#8208;resolution (pixel pitch = 6.5 &#181;m) &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se phototransistor array is fabricated and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated. The results establish an effective defect&#8208;engineered strategy with in situ large&#8208;area growth capability of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 and high&#8208;resolution device patterning, making &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se a promising photoresponsive platform for advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Universal Laser&#8208;Driven Controllable Synthesis Methodology Enabling Electromagnetic Absorption in High&#8208;Entropy Rare&#8208;Earth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromagnetic absorption functionality is successfully enabled in a series of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides using a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis technique. The profoundly broadened effective absorption bandwidth, from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz, in a prototype 20&#8208;cation G&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicate is attributed to the laser&#8208;induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies and the intensified local chemical order resulting from extreme element mixing.








Abstract
Imparting electromagnetic absorption functionality is key to realizing integrated structural and functional applications of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides (HEREOs). Here, a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis (LDCS) technique is reported to achieve this long&#8208;desired goal. Specifically, utilizing this approach, all polymorphs of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicates (HEREDs), including unreported &#948;&#8208;, F&#8208;, and G&#8208;type phases with up to 20 principal elements are successfully synthesized. Crucially, it is demonstrated that a G&#8208;type 20&#8208;cation HERED is conferred with exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption: an effective absorption bandwidth profoundly broadened from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz. This enhancement is attributed to a laser&#8208;induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies, which markedly increases conductance in electrical insulating HEREOs, and an exacerbation of nanointerface polarization loss caused by intensified local chemical order inherent to the incorporation of 20 constituent elements. The universality of this LDCS technique in enabling electromagnetic wave absorption across diverse HEREO families, including monosilicates, hafnates, zirconates, tantalates, niobates, and aluminates is finally verified, making them promising as radar stealth and thermal/environmental barrier integrated coating materials for use in hot section components of aircraft engines.

         <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Field Control of the Emergent Magnetic and Electronic Interactions at Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses enable ultrafast control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at LaNiO3/CaMnO3 interfaces. Combined X&#8208;ray and optical probes reveal sub&#8208;picosecond demagnetization driven by spin&#8208;polarized currents and slower magnetoelastic dynamics linked to spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These intertwined processes uncover a pathway to manipulate interfacial ferromagnetism in correlated oxides using ultrafast THz&#8208;field control.

Ultrafast electric&#8208;field control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at oxide interfaces offers exciting prospects for the development of the next generation of energy&#8208;efficient devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the electronic structure and emergent ferromagnetic interfacial state in epitaxial LaNiO3/CaMnO3 superlattices can be effectively controlled using intense, single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses. A suite of advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques is employed to measure a detailed magneto&#8208;optical profile and the thickness of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer. Then, a combination of time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent optical measurements is used to disentangle several correlated electronic and magnetic processes driven by ultrafast, high&#8208;field THz pulses. Sub&#8208;picosecond non&#8208;equilibrium Joule heating of the electronic system is observed, ultrafast demagnetization of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer, and slower dynamics indicative of a change in the magnetic state of the superlattice due to the transfer of spin&#8208;angular momentum to the lattice. These findings suggest a promising avenue for the efficient control of 2D ferromagnetic states at oxide interfaces using ultrafast electric&#8208;field pulses.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;in&#8208;Liquid Prints: High&#8208;Density Biochemically Encoded Information Preserved in Microdroplet Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel approach for encoding and storing information in the liquid state in microdroplet arrays. These liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid prints are generated by a droplet printing system capable of dynamically setting the composition of each droplet pixel. Information in the form of color images, QR codes, text characters, words and basic programmes are biochemically written into micro&#8208;liquid patterns.








Abstract
Liquids are dense repositories of information, challenged only by how well their compositions are defined, preserved, accessed, or measured. The precise spatial patterning of solutes within a bulk liquid is challenging since diffusion disperses local concentrations and thereby attenuates functionality. Herein, a new concept is introduced for writing and preserving information in the liquid state through liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid microdroplet array printing. This technology produces fine resolution, 2D liquid structures, composite of indexed water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet pixels each with a precise composition, a high spatial resolution and a tight inter&#8208;pixel pitch. With extreme control over droplet composition and by applying standard and custom encoding schemes, various forms of information are written biochemically such as images, QR codes, text characters and words. As a composite material, reversible phase transitions between dissolved liquid and crystallized solid states control information encryption and decryption. Compared to current liquid printing and chemical encoding paradigms, ours introduces a fundamentally new precedent for deterministically programming information release, exchange or decay without stimuli or physical processing. Further computational principles such as error correction and information storage are demonstrated. These micro&#8208;liquid patterns are relevant to any application based on precise liquid handling such as information theory, materials design and biological assays.

         <title>p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization of S&#8208;Pt&#8208;C Atomic Site Enables Durable Mg&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pd orbital hybridization strategy strengthens metalsupport interactions in single&#8208;metal&#8208;site COFs, stabilizing active sites and steering CO2 conversion pathways. The catalyst enables durable MgCO2 batteries with reduced energy barriers, flower&#8208;like discharge products, and record&#8208;long cycling stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts integrated within covalent organic framework (COFs) combine maximized atomic utilization with tunable porosity and robust coordination environments, enabling efficient CO2 diffusion, precise active&#8208;site control, and enhanced electron transfer for superior performance in metal&#8208;CO2 batteries. However, their practical application is limited by structural instability owing to the weak coordination effect of metal and &#960; electron under high redox&#8208;active operating condition. Herein, a p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy to strengthen metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) by introducing a sulfur atom with lone&#8208;pair electrons is reported, achieving highly durable Mg&#8208;CO2 and photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy effectively lowers the reaction energy barrier and steers the reaction pathway toward the formation of flower&#8208;like discharge products, thereby enhancing both the energy conversion efficiency and reversibility of the battery. The Mg&#8208;CO2 battery with strengthen MSI achieves a high stable operation for over 420&#160;h at an ultralow overpotential of 0.34&#160;V and a high capacity of 50&#160;Ah&#160;g&#8722;1, representing the best&#8208;reported performance among Mg&#8208;CO2 batteries with single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst to date. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies prove that the strong MSI decreases discharge/charge energy barriers and switches the product morphology from dense, compact films to flower&#8208;like morphology.

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Antibody Formulation via Solvent&#8208;Based Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous solid antibodies are encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles through a solvent&#8208;based dehydration process. The solvent extracts water from antibody solution droplets, causing the antibody to concentrate, and precipitation of the antibody into amorphous solid is induced. The particles are resuspended into aqueous solution in which they are injectable for subcutaneous delivery at high concentrations.








Abstract
Although subcutaneous (SC) delivery is the preferred administration route for immunotherapies and other biologics for improved patient compliance and lower healthcare costs, it necessitates high&#8208;concentration antibody formulations. However, high&#8208;concentration antibody solutions face significant instabilities and prohibitively high viscosities. Other approaches for high&#8208;concentration formulations have been developed, including non&#8208;aqueous solutions, which can be irritating or painful, and antibody&#8208;laden hydrogel microparticles, which require centrifugation and are limited to concentrations &lt;300 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. This work presents a new formulation process wherein the antibody is concentrated and encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles via solvent&#8208;based dehydration. The final dosage form is an aqueous particle suspension with a formulation concentration of 360 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. In this process, microparticles are synthesized continuously, and antibody precipitation is realized simultaneously to dehydration, which allows for higher antibody concentrations. Antibody phase behavior and precipitation&#8211;dehydration kinetics are analyzed. The antibody is structurally and functionally stable in the microparticle post&#8208;processing and after 4 months. Injectability of the suspension meets clinical standards with glide force &lt;20 N. For the first time, an aqueous antibody formulation at high concentrations comparable to non&#8208;aqueous formulations is presented, ideal for subcutaneous administration. The process is envisioned to be generalizable as a platform for SC delivery in multiple clinical&#160;applications.

         <title>Disorder Scattering Induced Large Room Temperature Nonlinear Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semiconductor CdGeAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk CdGeAs2, a well&#8208;known nonlinear optical semiconductor, exhibits an exceptionally large room&#8208;temperature nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), achieving a record&#8208;high nonlinear Hall responsivity of 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m/V. This pronounced NLHE enables broadband frequency mixing up to the megahertz regime, establishing CdGeAs2 as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation nonlinear electronic and optoelectronic technologies.








Abstract
The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time&#8208;reversal symmetry has emerged as a transformative phenomenon within the Hall effect family, attracting significant interest due to its profound implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications. While prior studies have predominantly focused on NLHE in 2D materials, advancements in practical applications have been constrained by low operating temperatures and limited responsivity, typically below 10&#8722;4 m/V. Achieving significant responsivity at room temperature (RT) in 3D systems has proven challenging, particularly for scattering&#8208;induced NLHE. Here, the discovery of disorder scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in chalcopyrite&#8208;type CdGeAs2 bulk single crystals is reported, demonstrating a remarkable responsivity of up to 10&#8722;3 m/V at RT. The studies reveal that NLHE not only facilitates ac&#8208;driven second harmonic and rectification Hall responses but also induces an exceptionally large anomalous Hall angle. Through band structure measurements by ARPES, DFT calculations, as well as symmetry and nonlinear Hall conductivity scaling analyses, disorder scattering is identified as the dominant mechanism for the NLHE in CdGeAs2. Leveraging the observed strong responsivity of NLHE at RT, its broadband electronic frequency mixing capability in the MHz range is further demonstrated. This work sets the foundation for integrating scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in 3D materials into very high&#8208;frequency mixing technologies.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers via Polar Ether Linker for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a polar ether&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced to enhance the efficiency and durability of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). Rational linker engineering enables dense and uniform SAM coverage, strengthens interfacial adhesion, and facilitates efficient hole extraction. As a result, inverted f&#8208;PSCs deliver 25.11% efficiency (certified 24.59%) and retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation portable, wearable, and building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics. However, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules often exhibit weak interfacial binding and limited mechanical coupling, leading to incomplete coverage and poor contact on rough flexible substrates. Here, a molecularly tailored SAM design is presented that addresses these challenges through rational linker engineering. Replacing common alkyl chains with a polar ether linker modulates the electron density around the phosphonic acid anchoring group, while the ether oxygen atom acts as an effective&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. This dual functionality promotes Et2OPACz to assemble into a dense, uniform layer on flexible substrates, thereby strengthening interfacial adhesion, improving perovskite film quality, and facilitating hole extraction. As a result, f&#8208;PSCs incorporating Et2OPACz SAM achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11% (certified 24.59%), among the highly reported for f&#8208;PSCs. The devices retain 94% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation and 92.6% after 5000 bending cycles at a radius of 3&#160;mm. These results demonstrate that polar ether linker engineering provides a powerful strategy to simultaneously optimize interfacial contact, charge transport, and mechanical durability in high&#8208;performance f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Largely Enhanced Photocatalysis Process by Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient and Eco&#8208;Friendly Recovery of Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an organic&#8208;inorganic composite microsphere catalyst for efficient gold extraction from electronic waste combined contact&#8208;electro&#8208;photocatalysis (CE&#8208;PhC). Fabricated by co&#8208;firing PTFE and TiO2, the catalyst enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic performance under ultrasonic excitation. Comparative tests show nearly an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in efficiency, offering potential for sustainable precious metal recovery and electronic waste recycling.








Abstract
Precious metal recovery has become increasingly critical due to resource scarcity, while conventional extraction methods often suffer from low efficiency and pollution problem. Here, this work proposes an efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic strategy based on the integration of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) and photocatalysis. The composite microsphere catalyst is fabricated by using low temperature co&#8208;firing TiO2/PTFE particles, which have an average diameter of &#8776;10 &#181;m and expose both TiO2 and PTFE active sites on its surface, enabling dual CEC&#8211;photocatalytic synergy reactions. Compared to pristine TiO2 catalyst with similar weight, this composite microsphere catalyst exhibits a tenfold enhancement in gold extraction efficiency from electronic waste. This high&#8208;performance leaching system operates under mild conditions, alleviating the need for traditional strong oxidants and offering potential for industrial application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that charge transfer from H2O to PTFE and subsequently into TiO2, with favorable energy band alignment between PTFE and TiO2 ensuring efficient carrier hopping and enhanced photocatalytic activity. This composite catalytic strategy based on organic&#8211;inorganic microsphere catalysts may be extended to areas like wastewater treatment, organic synthesis, and industrial waste valorization.

         <title>Ammonium Salts as Curing Agents to Obtain Ionic Epoxy Resins With a Thermoplastic&#8208;to&#8208;Thermoset Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic epoxy networks are prepared using ammonium salts as hardeners, leading to a two&#8208;stage curing process with a thermoplastic&#8208;like intermediate. This uncommon behavior enables extrusion and fabrication of thermoplastic prepregs that can be cured into thermoset composites. The resulting materials combine ionic functionality and versatile processing. They also enable chemical matrix dissolution for fiber recovery, while relying on simple, industrially available components. 








Abstract
A new class of epoxy thermosets is presented, prepared using ammonium salts as hardeners, enabling the direct formulation of networks with ionic functionality from simple, industrially available building blocks. The curing process occurs in two distinct thermal stages: the formation of a fusible thermoplastic&#8208;like intermediate, followed by crosslinking into an infusible thermoset. This intermediate behavior is highly unusual in epoxy systems and allows the material to be processed using methods typically applied to thermoplastics, such as extrusion. The practical relevance of this system is demonstrated through the fabrication of enduring prepregs that can be shaped and handled as thermoplastics during processing, but form crosslinked thermosets upon curing. Finally, the cured matrix can be chemically solubilized in aqueous nitric acid under relatively mild conditions, allowing efficient recycling of intact carbon fibers. This work introduces a scalable platform for functional epoxy networks with broad processing and application potential.

         <title>3D Anodic Alumina Nanoarchitectures: A Decade of Progress from Foundational Science to Functional Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered three&#8208;dimensional anodic aluminum oxide (3D&#8208;AAO) nanoarchitectures with longitudinal and transverse pores enable architecture&#8208;driven metamaterials. The review maps fabrication advances, including hybrid pulse anodization, and shows how 3D&#8208;AAO templates tailor properties across magnetism, energy, catalysis, and sensing. Intrinsic 3D&#8208;AAO also offers passive radiative cooling and ultralow thermal conductivity, bridging nanoscale design and macroscale function.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanostructures are redefining materials engineering by shifting control from composition to architecture. This review charts the rise of 3D anodic aluminum oxide (3D&#8208;AAO), beginning with the 2014 introduction of ordered, interconnected nanoarchitectures that established a new paradigm. We detail fabrication advances that enable precise control of geometry, pore shape, and periodicity, including hybrid pulse anodization that alternates between hard anodization (HA) and mild anodization (MA) conditions. These architected templates used empty or as scaffolds for magnetic, semiconducting, and polymeric phases act as metamaterials with tunable properties. In magnetism, geometry enables easy&#8208;axis reversal and uncovers magnetoelastic anisotropy. In semiconductors, 3D nanonetworks raise the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) relative to similarly prepared bulk via geometry&#8208;driven phonon scattering. In polymers, 3D&#8208;AAO guides flexible photonic devices with full&#8208;gamut structural color and biodegradable, biocompatible triboelectric nanogenerators with high power density. Empty 3D&#8208;AAO offers passive daytime radiative cooling properties. Delivering &#12297;10&#160;&#176;C sub&#8208;ambient cooling, passively reduces building air&#8208;conditioning demand. The field's influence spans energy storage, catalysis, and biosensing. We conclude with pathways to industrial scalability through cost&#8208;efficient, room&#8208;temperature processing on low&#8208;purity aluminum, positioning 3D&#8208;AAO to bridge nanoscale physics and macroscale function.

         <title>Dimensionally Stable Nanofibrous Nonwoven as a Flexible Dynamic Emissivity Switching Temperature&#8208;Regulating Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This flexible, humidity&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsive material shows reversible emissivity switching without external energy input. The electrospun PNIPAM copolymer network, stabilized through thiol&#8208;ene crosslinking, maintains its dimensional stability during passive pore opening and closing. Combined with a silver coating and metamaterial design, the system enables passive heat retention and dissipation for sustainable thermal comfort.








Abstract
Smart textiles that passively regulate thermal comfort provide a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive climate control. A promising strategy involves modulating radiative heat transfer by dynamically adjusting surface emissivity, thereby facilitating reversible switching between heat&#8208;retentive and heat&#8208;dissipative states. Existing systems enable emissivity switching but often need external energy or lack dimensional stability when deformed, which limits wearable applications. Here, a fully passive, autonomously adaptive dynamic emissivity switch textile (DEST) based on a thermo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive electrospun poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) copolymer is introduced. To ensure robust functionality in humid or aqueous environments, a crosslinkable allyl&#8208;functionalized PNIPAM copolymer is synthesized via post&#8208;polymerization amidation of a P(NIPAM&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) copolymer and processed using a green water&#8208;ethanol&#8208;based electrospinning technique. Thiol&#8208;ene crosslinking produced water&#8208;stable, thermoresponsive nanofibers with a transition near skin temperature. For reversible macropore actuation, a dimensionally stable architecture is employed that avoids out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion, achieved through a honeycomb&#8208;shaped electrospinning collector and a tailored mechanical cutting pattern. A silver coating imparts the overall infrared (IR) reflectivity, facilitating radiative heat retention when the macropores are closed.

     alt="Dimensionally Stable Nanofibrous Nonwoven as a Flexible Dynamic Emissivity Switching Temperature-Regulating Material"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexible, humidity- and temperature-responsive material shows reversible emissivity switching without external energy input. The electrospun PNIPAM copolymer network, stabilized through thiol-ene crosslinking, maintains its dimensional stability during passive pore opening and closing. Combined with a silver coating and metamaterial design, the system enables passive heat retention and dissipation for sustainable thermal comfort.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart textiles that passively regulate thermal comfort provide a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive climate control. A promising strategy involves modulating radiative heat transfer by dynamically adjusting surface emissivity, thereby facilitating reversible switching between heat-retentive and heat-dissipative states. Existing systems enable emissivity switching but often need external energy or lack dimensional stability when deformed, which limits wearable applications. Here, a fully passive, autonomously adaptive dynamic emissivity switch textile (DEST) based on a thermo- and humidity-responsive electrospun poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) copolymer is introduced. To ensure robust functionality in humid or aqueous environments, a crosslinkable allyl-functionalized PNIPAM copolymer is synthesized via post-polymerization amidation of a P(NIPAM-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-methyl acrylate) copolymer and processed using a green water-ethanol-based electrospinning technique. Thiol-ene crosslinking produced water-stable, thermoresponsive nanofibers with a transition near skin temperature. For reversible macropore actuation, a dimensionally stable architecture is employed that avoids out-of-plane distortion, achieved through a honeycomb-shaped electrospinning collector and a tailored mechanical cutting pattern. A silver coating imparts the overall infrared (IR) reflectivity, facilitating radiative heat retention when the macropores are closed. The resulting DEST exhibits dual responsiveness to temperature and ambient humidity, enabling passive switching between emissive and reflective states without external energy input, with a &#8776;6 &#176;C reversible thermal comfort window.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topology and Material Optimization in Ultra&#8208;Soft Magneto&#8208;Active Structures: Making Advantage of Residual Anisotropies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual magnetization induces pronounced mechanical anisotropy in ultra&#8208;soft magnetorheological elastomers, shaping deformation and actuation even without external magnetic fields. This study introduces a computational&#8208;experimental framework integrating magneto&#8208;mechanical coupling into topology optimization for designing soft magnetic actuators with tailored responses. The approach jointly optimizes material distribution and residual magnetization to achieve specific, predictable, and efficient actuation modes.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;soft magnetoactive materials (stiffness &lt;10&#160;kPa) have transformed bioengineering and soft robotics, enabling remote actuation within soft biologically relevant environments. Despite major advances in the last decade, the complexity of their magneto&#8208;mechanical coupled behavior still hinders efficient topology and material optimization strategies for these smart structures. Two primary challenges remain: incomplete understanding and identification of the underlying physical mechanisms, and numerical limitations that restrict realistic simulation of the fully coupled problem. This work addresses these challenges by identifying and characterizing mechanical anisotropies arising from residual magnetization. In ultra&#8208;soft matrices, residual magnetization leads to microstructural rearrangements of magnetic particles, inducing mechanical anisotropy even without external fields. This anisotropy depends nonlinearly on matrix stiffness, particle properties, volume fraction, and apparent magnetization direction. These dependencies are experimentally quantified and described by a new constitutive model. The model is implemented within a computational framework that integrates these effects into advanced topology and material optimization algorithms. The framework is then used to demonstrate how accounting for these physical mechanisms enables the design of magneto&#8208;mechanical responses with improved control and&#160;functionality.

         <title>Atomistic Mechanisms Triggered by Joule Heating Effects in Metallic Cu&#8208;Bi Nanowires for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi doped metallic Cu nanowires are promising for spintronics thanks to the stabilization of a giant spin Hall effect. However, heat resulting from current injection forces Bi to leave solution, forcing segregation into monoatomic decorations which evolve into coherent crystalline aggregates. Nevertheless, low Bi amounts are stable, thus paving the way towards integration of these nanomaterials into future devices.








Abstract
Joule heating may severely impact the response to electric current injection of nanomaterials for spintronics. Here, the effects of heating in Bi doped Cu nanowires, a system where 1% Bi doping promotes a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), are studied by in situ high resolution electron microscopy. High quality Bi&#8208;Cu nanowires are grown by room temperature electrodeposition. The large size of Bi cations precludes insertion into the dense Cu face&#8208;centered lattice. Still, homogeneous compositions up to a nominal 7% Bi are successfully obtained with thicknesses &lt;100&#160;nm and grain sizes in the micron longitudinal scale, coated by a native oxide. In situ injection of current promotes fast Bi segregation out of solution. Controlled in situ annealing shows that the onset for segregation starts above temperatures of 250&#160;&#176;C. Within minutes, Bi atoms diffuse to grain boundaries or to exposed surfaces, such as the nanowire tips. Monoatomic thick Bi ordered decorations appear, preferentially on surface planes of the {320}$\{320\}$ type. Annealing at 400&#160;&#176;C promotes the growth of pure Bi nanocrystals, coherent with the underlying Cu matrix. Still, the intra&#8208;grain Bi concentration remains finite at values near 1%. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations show that small amounts of Bi atoms are stable as substitutional impurities, confirming the potential of this system as building block for future spintronic devices.

         <title>Meticulous Construction of Internal Encapsulation Layer via In Situ Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking Polymerization and Ring&#8208;Opening Addition Reactions for Efficient and Environmental Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal encapsulation layer (GPTFP) is developed via self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization and ring&#8208;opening addition reactions to resolve the deterioration influences of byproducts, the tradeoff between perovskite quality and Pb2+ leakage, achieving 26.83% efficiency inverted devices with over 2000 h operational stability.








Abstract
Capping an internal encapsulation layer (IEL) on the top surface of perovskite plays significant roles in enhancing perovskite quality and achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Herein, a novel IEL is in situ synthesized by self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization of siloxane motifs and ring&#8208;opening addition of ethylene oxide groups to overcome the long&#8208;overlooked drawbacks of IEL, such as eliminating deterioration influences of byproducts, as well as the tradeoff between improving perovskite quality and minimizing Pb2+ leakage. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that amidogen, hydroxyl, and carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#9472;F) bond in GPTFP synergistically stabilize grain boundaries, passivate surface defects, block oxygen and moisture, as well as minimize the Pb2+ leakage of perovskite through hydrogen bond, oxygen&#8211;lead, fluorine&#8211;lead, and hydrophobic interactions. The resultant perovskite exhibits enhanced crystallinity quality, relieved residual strain, air&#8208;stable black phase retained after 200 days of ambient aging, and undetectable leakage of Pb2+ under simulated harsh conditions. Consequently, the resultant inverted device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.83% (certified 26.57%) with a certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state output of 26.51%. Notably, such a device retains &gt;93 % of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 2000&#160;h of ambient storage (30&#177;5% relative humidity, 25&#160;&#176;C), respectively.

         <title>Molecular Bonding Engineering Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Electrochromic Energy Storage in Flexible PEDOT Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterium&#8208;engineered PEDOT (PEDOT&#8208;D) is synthesized via isotopic substitution and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization. Strong C&#9472;D bonds damp backbone vibrations, yielding films with a &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles. Flexible PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitors present operational stability over 10&#160;000 cycles and from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C with real&#8208;time visual state&#8208;of&#8208;charge feedback.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require materials that can withstand mechanical deformation while retaining electrochemical and optoelectronic functionality. Conducting polymers (CPs) are attractive candidates due to their inherent flexibility and electronic conductivity. However, their practical application is often limited by poor long&#8208;term stability and deteriorated performance, particularly under thermal or mechanical stress, owing to structural degradation and overoxidation at high potentials. Herein, a dual&#8208;strategy molecular design is adopted to intrinsically stabilize poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) by combining deuterium substitution with Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization, which suppresses backbone vibrational energy and mitigates over&#8208;oxidative degradation during redox cycling. The resulting deuterated PEDOT film demonstrates exceptional multifunctional performance, including &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles, a high electrochromic contrast of 40.9% at 700&#160;nm, and a specific capacitance of 317&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based wearable electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitor devices subsequently exhibit 14.3% transmittance at 550&#160;nm, a specific capacitance of 39.7&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, robust stability, and reliable operation from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This work establishes a structurally grounded molecular strategy for advancing the durability of CPs, providing a rational design for next&#8208;generation flexible energy systems that are mechanically robust, thermally adaptive, and optically responsive.

         <title>Towards a Synergy&#8208;Driven Design Paradigm for Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Polymer Nanocomposites via Predictive Multiscale Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergy&#8208;driven design paradigm aims to identify nanocomposites whose properties exceed rule&#8208;of&#8208;mixtures limits. This study focuses on thermal conductivity, a key factor in many technologically relevant MOF&#8208;polymer applications. Atomistic simulations identify interphases that enhance or suppress heat transport, while a multiscale framework reveals how these interphase effects can ultimately govern bulk material behavior.








Abstract
Experimental reports indicate that embedding metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in polymer matrices both facilitates practical engineering applications and may yield properties surpassing the rule&#8208;of&#8208;mixtures expectations owing to interfacial synergy. Herein, computational methods are used to predict this amplification a priori, opening the door to in&#8208;silico synergy&#8208;driven design paradigm. Thermal conductivity is chosen as the model property, important because heat management governs adsorption&#8208;driven separations employing MOFs. Non&#8208;equilibrium molecular dynamics provides conductivities for the MOF, the polymer, and the interphase; a multiscale scheme then delivers the composite value. The workflow is applied to HKUST&#8208;1/polyethylene glycol(PEG) and UiO&#8208;66/PEG and benchmarked against ZIF&#8208;8/stearic acid(SA). For HKUST&#8208;1/PEG a conductivity of 0.39 W/mK is predicted, representing a 0.09 W/mK synergy above the rule&#8208;of&#8208;mixtures baseline; experimental measurements report, respectively, 0.428 and 0.14 W/mK, confirming the model predictions. UiO&#8208;66/PEG model and its experimental analogue UiO&#8208;66(CH3)/PEG display comparable agreement and, notably, outperform both bulk constituents. In contrast, ZIF&#8208;8/SA exhibits no significant enhancement. The demonstrated predictive route identifies MOF/polymer pairs with favorable thermal transport and guides rational design of advanced adsorbent&#160;composites.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Fluorinated Gases by Porous Organic Cages &#8211; Effects of Fluorinated Side&#8208;Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of a series of porous organic cages with perfluorinated alkyl side&#8208;chains of different lengths is presented. The structure&#8208;property relationship of the various cages on gas sorption of highly potent greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is investigated. Very high selectivities have been obtained especially for PFC&#8208;218 and PFC&#8208;318.








Abstract
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as related gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) are examples of F&#8208;gases, a subclass of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). F&#8208;gases are anthropogenic greenhouse gases with the highest global warming potentials known and thus contribute significantly to global warming. To reduce their amount in the atmosphere, selectively adsorbing materials would be beneficial, but such materials are rare. A homologous series of porous organic cages with fluorinated side&#8208;chains is synthesized and depending on the targeted gas as well as operating temperature, different cages have high selectivities for certain F&#8208;gases against N2, CO2, and O2. Within this series, new benchmark selectivities against, e.g., perfluoro propane (PFC&#8208;218) and perfluoro cyclobutane (PFC&#8208;318) have been achieved based on attractive fluorine&#8208;fluorine interactions. Furthermore, these interactions are exploited for the first time in the adsorption of sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Chiral COF&#8211;2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Neuromorphic Circular Polarization Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework with a 2D molecular crystal is presented. This design enables chiral&#8208;selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing in a single device. The resulting synaptic transistors demonstrate record chiroptical discrimination (gEPSC = 0.73) and photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), facilitating in&#8208;sensor preprocessing for high&#8208;accuracy neuromorphic vision capable of handling noisy environments.








Abstract
Emulating the biological visual system's ability to perceive and preprocess circularly polarized light (CPL) offers transformative opportunities for advanced imaging, quantum communication, and autonomous navigation. However, the implementation of such functionality in artificial systems demands the seamless integration of chiral selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing capabilities, a combination that remains beyond the reach of current optoelectronic materials. Herein, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction architecture is presented, integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework (COF) with a 2D molecular crystal (2DMC), to overcome these limitations. By constructing a type&#8208;II band&#8208;aligned interface between a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked TpPa&#8208;COF and an air&#8208;stable dithienothiophene&#8208;based 2DMC, the architecture enables directional, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer and efficient exciton dissociation at the interface. The resulting chiroptical synaptic transistor achieves a record polarization discrimination ratio (gEPSC = 0.73) and exceptional photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), substantially surpassing existing organic CPL&#8208;sensitive detectors. Furthermore, when configured into a 3 &#215; 3 convolutional kernel array, the device enables in&#8208;sensor noise reduction and feature extraction, elevating the classification accuracy of noisy images from 51.5% to 71.2% in the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset. This work establishes an integrated material platform for CPL&#8208;driven neuromorphic vision, bridging chiral photonics with bioinspired computing.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Afterglow from Luminescent Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments has been developed by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent polymeric materials which combine afterglow emission with mechanical flexibility and adaptability to external stimuli are well&#8208;suited for dynamic optical devices, encoding, anticounterfeiting, and soft robotics. However, current systems rely on static matrices and organic phosphors, which limit their afterglow duration, flexibility, processability, and responsiveness to various stimuli. Here, an active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators is demonstrated. The resulting material exhibits ultralong emission (up to 1200 s) in the dark, enabling reprogrammable information encryption and reversible scattering&#8208;to&#8208;transparent transition upon mechanical, thermal, or light stimuli, allowing for multimodal decoding. A bicolor, spatially encoded phosphorescent soft actuator is fabricated that appears plain and unmarked under daylight, but reveals structured emission in the dark while simultaneously exhibiting shape change under heat or light. Incorporation of an additional fluorescent dye further endows the system with light&#8208;environment sensitivity, enabling luminescent rolling wheels and fiber actuators capable of self&#8208;signaling and recovery tracking. This work not only demonstrates constructing active luminescent materials but also provides valuable insights toward adaptive and interactive glowing optical devices.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics, severe volume variation, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Theoretically, concurrent selenium doping and carbon intercalation are revealed to effectively mitigate these challenges by improving electronic conductivity, promoting phase transition reaction kinetics, and alleviating structural deformation, thereby improving the structural flexibility of the MoS2 anode. Experimentally, a synergistic hollow carbon sphere&#8208;confined, carbon&#8208;intercalated and selenium&#8208;doped MoS2 (MoSSe@HCS) anode is rationally designed, achieving an ultra&#8208;expanded interlayer spacing (1.24&#160;nm), appropriate buffer space and robust carbon encapsulation. This design boosts charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, suppresses volume variation, and stabilizes SEI. Consequently, the MoSSe@HCS anode exhibits high capacity (441.5 mAh g&#8722;1, 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (121.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and cyclability (87.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). A full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode displays high&#8208;capacity retention of 82.1% after 600 cycles at 17 C and a pouch&#8208;type full cell sustains over 2500 cycles at 10 C, demonstrating significant commercial viability. This work establishes a theory&#8208;guided design paradigm that bridges fundamental understanding and practical deployment of high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

Overview of principal direct&#8208;write graphene patterning methodologies including focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), laser induced graphitisation (LIG), focused ion beam (FIB), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)








Abstract
Graphene, with its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties, remains a cornerstone material for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, conventional lithographic approaches to graphene patterning are fraught with challenges, including contamination, alignment complexity, and scalability constraints. This review critically examines the evolving landscape of direct&#8208;write graphene technologies, focusing on forefront strategies such as focused electron beam&#8208;induced deposition (FEBID), polymer&#8208;to&#8208;graphene (P2G) conversion, focused ion beam (FIB) modification, and laser&#8208;assisted graphitisation. These techniques represent a departure from traditional top&#8208;down or transfer&#8208;based methods by enabling bottom&#8208;up, spatially resolved patterning without intermediary masking steps. Particular attention is devoted to the physicochemical mechanisms that underlie electron&#8208; and photon&#8208;mediated graphitisation, the role of precursor chemistry and substrate interactions, as well as the influence of beam parameters on sp2&#8208;carbon content and structural ordering. The review further delineates the limitations intrinsic to current methodologies, including partial graphitisation, resolution fidelity, and hardware constraints, and proposes a roadmap to achieve truly &#8220;direct&#8221; graphene writing. This includes in situ processing under controlled environments, advanced beam control systems, and the adoption of catalytic and graphitizable precursors. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for the rational design of next&#8208;generation nanofabrication protocols and underscores the transformative potential of direct&#8208;write techniques in enabling scalable, high&#8208;fidelity graphene&#8208;based&#160;devices.

         <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon&#8208;Enhanced Sum&#8208;Frequency Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear optical microscopy technique is introduced that enables rapid imaging of hexagonal boron nitride monolayers, which are usually optically invisible. The nonlinear mixing of mid&#8208;infrared and visible laser pulses enables full crystallographic imaging through phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency generation microscopy, where the resonant excitation of a phonon provides 800&#8208;fold enhancement.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer samples of hBN however, remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here, phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency microscopy is introduced as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualizing their crystal orientation. Femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses are used for sum&#8208;frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide&#8208;field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an &#8776;800&#8208;fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;&#181;m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Heterodyne detection combined with azimuthal sample rotation further provides full crystallographic information. Combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation reveals that triangular domains of CVD&#8208;grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen&#8208;terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy is an ultra&#8208;sensitive tool with the potential to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles in a wide range of van der Waals structures, where locating and identifying monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

         <title>In Situ Amine Formation to Modulate MOF&#8208;Derived PdIn N&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;assisted approach converts PdIn&#8208;MOF into PdIn intermetallic nanoparticles embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon. In situ&#8208;generated amines trigger early Pd nucleation, producing smaller PdIn domains than direct pyrolysis. Amine sterics and basicity tune composition and particle size, while solvent and amine co&#8208;determine textural features. The resulting materials excel in alkyne semihydrogenation. This MOF&#8208;derived strategy offers a platform for advanced catalyst engineering.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are versatile precursors for developing heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts with complex structures and functionalities. In this work, we rationalize an amine&#8208;mediated approach that combines a mild chemical pretreatment with pyrolysis to direct the transformation of a PdIn&#8208;MOF precursor into dispersed PdIn intermetallic nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;doped carbon. Advanced characterization techniques, including synchrotron ex situ and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), demonstrate that the chemical pretreatment, involving in situ amine generation under reductive conditions, facilitates the early formation of Pd nanoparticles. This pre&#8208;nucleation influences the kinetics of intermetallic phase formation during the subsequent pyrolysis, promoting a more regulated alloying process. Systematically varying nitro precursors and solvents shows that amine sterics and basicity govern nanoparticle size, phase development, PdIn ratio, nitrogen doping, and surface area. Finally, catalytic evaluation in alkyne semihydrogenation shows that the family of PdIn catalysts thus prepared achieves outstanding selectivity and high productivity, outperforming benchmarking Pd/C and Lindlar catalysts across diverse substrates. Specifically, materials synthesized using ethanol and amines with low pKb values offer superior control over particle formation and catalytic behavior. Overall, these findings establish and explain a modular strategy for designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation applications via MOF&#8208;derived syntheses.

         <title>Unique Dual&#8208;Affinity Strategy for Specific Lipopolysaccharide Clearance in Sepsis Therapy: Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Molecularly Imprinted Polymers via Emulsion Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual&#8208;affinity adsorbent (PS@PA&#8208;PHK+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape&#8208;selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA&#8208;PHK+ demonstrates high specificity, broad&#8208;spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.








Abstract
Sepsis is an infection&#8208;induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy. However, selective capture of LPS is challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, extremely low concentrations (ng&#183;mL&#8722;1), and complexity of blood components. Here, a novel dual&#8208;affinity strategy is presented for designing high&#8208;specificity LPS adsorbents. Leveraging phage display, a high&#8208;affinity peptide ligand (P&#8208;HK) targeting the LPS family is identified by screening against their conserved Kdo2&#8208;Lipid A structure. Concurrently, delicate molecularly imprinted polymers (PS@PA+) with geometrically matched cavities are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization, exploiting the oriented assembly of amphiphilic LPS templates at oil&#8208;water interfaces. Conjugation of the imprinted polymers with the peptide ligand produced PS@PA&#8208;PHK+, which exhibits highly specific LPS binding and demonstrates exceptional performance, including remarkable E. coli LPS clearance efficiency (99.2% in buffer; 95.4% in blood), high adsorption capacity (543 EU&#183;mg&#8722;1), broad&#8208;spectrum clearance of diverse bacterial LPSs, robust anti&#8208;fouling properties, and satisfactory biocompatibility. Furthermore, PS@PA&#8208;PHK+&#8208;based hemoperfusion in a septic rabbit model confirmed significant therapeutic efficacy, remarkably reducing circulating LPS levels and mitigating organ damage. This material design overcomes the challenge of specific LPS clearance, offering substantial promise for transformative sepsis therapy.

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual-affinity adsorbent (PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape-selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+ demonstrates high specificity, broad-spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is an infection-induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy. However, selective capture of LPS is challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, extremely low concentrations (ng&#183;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and complexity of blood components. Here, a novel dual-affinity strategy is presented for designing high-specificity LPS adsorbents. Leveraging phage display, a high-affinity peptide ligand (P-HK) targeting the LPS family is identified by screening against their conserved Kdo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Lipid A structure. Concurrently, delicate molecularly imprinted polymers (PS@PA+) with geometrically matched cavities are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization, exploiting the oriented assembly of amphiphilic LPS templates at oil-water interfaces. Conjugation of the imprinted polymers with the peptide ligand produced PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+, which exhibits highly specific LPS binding and demonstrates exceptional performance, including remarkable &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; LPS clearance efficiency (99.2% in buffer; 95.4% in blood), high adsorption capacity (543 EU&#183;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), broad-spectrum clearance of diverse bacterial LPSs, robust anti-fouling properties, and satisfactory biocompatibility. Furthermore, PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+-based hemoperfusion in a septic rabbit model confirmed significant therapeutic efficacy, remarkably reducing circulating LPS levels and mitigating organ damage. This material design overcomes the challenge of specific LPS clearance, offering substantial promise for transformative sepsis therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic WO3&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Simultaneous N2 Fixation and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed by combining multiple doping strategies together in WO3 nanoplates. The optimized photocatalyst exbibits enhanced light absorption, hot charge carrier generation, and N2 activation. It can produce NH3 and H2O2 simultaneously. A type of floating biphasic plasmonic photocatalytic film is further fabricated to improve the efficiency and scalability of the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has recently received much attention in generating high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalysts are frontier materials that can effectively employ localized surface plasmon resonance to generate and utilize hot charge carriers. Herein, the development of a new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst through hydrogen doping, oxygen vacancy (OV) introduction, and metal doping is reported. Hydrogen doping and OV introduction broaden the light absorption range of the WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst, thereby enabling the generation of more hot charge carriers. Metal doping provides more catalytically active sites. More interestingly, both hot electrons and holes can be used to generate high&#8208;value&#8208;added products, i.e., ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. The optimal Mo&#8208;H0.23WO3&#8722;x photocatalyst exhibits excellent ammonia and hydrogen peroxide production rates of 187.53 and 196.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, a biphasic photocatalytic system is designed to suppress light absorption by water and maximize sunlight utilization. This work expands the scope of plasmonic photocatalysts towards degenerately doped plasmonic metal oxide semiconductors and provides a new paradigm for the solar&#8208;driven generation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Mass Diffusion&#8208;Dominated Phase Separation Enabling On&#8208;Demand and Repeatable Lifetime Programming of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer hydrogels with programmable lifetimes are designed via mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation. Their lifetimes are tunable from 9.1 to 130.8 ms by varying heating time (0&#8211;60 min), and repeatable RTP is achieved under heating/cooling cycles. These hydrogels serve as rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms for time&#8208;dependent information display.








Abstract
Current luminescent polymer hydrogels rely primarily on tunable emission intensities/colors. Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with on&#8208;demand programmable lifetimes, albeit long envisaged, have never been achieved, but such RTP hydrogels will provide another lifetime dimension to enrich the family of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for broadening their emerging applications. Herein, the mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation strategy is proposed to develop the first RTP polymer hydrogels, whose lifetime can be continuously programmed from 9.1 to 130.8&#160;ms. Upon heating at 90 &#176;C, cooperative coordination and hydrophobic interactions in hydrogels induce a dense/sparse polymer phase separation, leading to controllable rubbery&#8208;to&#8208;glassy transition with 154&#8208;fold enhancement in Young's modulus, thereby efficiently restricting molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet excitons. Note that the hydrogels&#8217; RTP performance is essentially not controlled by heat transport but is dominated by phase&#8208;separation kinetics, therefore their lifetimes can be widely programmed by merely manipulating the heating duration. Further natural cooling at 25&#160;&#176;C makes polymer phase re&#8208;fusion to recover the rubbery state, enabling the repeatable RTP lifetime programming. Based on these findings, rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved information decryption platform with time&#8208;dependent security is demonstrated. This study opens new avenues of RTP hydrogels by demonstrating the unprecedented lifetime&#8208;programming capacity and enriches the intelligence of luminescent materials.

         <title>Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Force Regulated Solid&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Slider for Highly Efficient and Robust Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, which enables stable operation of patterned liquid as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical by regulating three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term durability and a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%.








Abstract
Conventional sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy into electricity through relative motion between solid&#8208;solid tribo&#8208;layers. However, the inherent trade&#8208;off between maintaining close contact and mitigating interfacial friction hinders the device's energy conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, where milliliter&#8208;scale liquid motion is precisely governed by a liquid&#8208;driver consisting of a hydrophilic interface enclosed by a hydrophobic boundary. By theoretical analysis and experimental regulation of solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, stable operation of the liquid&#8208;slider with a designed pattern is realized as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical. Benefiting from the shape&#8208;adaptivity and ultra&#8208;smooth properties of the liquid, a palm&#8208;sized LS&#8208;TENG outputs 2856 &#181;J of energy per cycle with an average torque of just 0.73 mN&#183;m at 30&#160;rpm, achieving a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%. The optimized friction during solid&#8208;liquid dynamic interactions ensures the excellent stability of LS&#8208;TENG over six months of continuous operation. Moreover, the encapsulated LS&#8208;TENG autonomously initiates under a 1.3 m&#160;s&#8722;1 breeze, powering 960 series&#8208;connected green LEDs and enabling wireless wind speed monitoring. The regulation of three&#8208;phase interfacial forces in solid&#8208;liquid TENG provides a feasible path for efficient and reliable mechanical energy harvesting.

         <title>Steric&#8208;Hindrance Effect Induced Fabrication of Lightweight, Bi&#8208;Functional, and Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Infiltrate Hosts for 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of abundant bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;doping sites on easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate hosts has been successfully realized for the first time. This breakthrough has facilitated the achievement of an ultralight, efficiently bi&#8208;functional and easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host, enabling a pouch lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (&#8776;2 Ah) to exhibit an impressive energy density of 502 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cyclic stability.








Abstract
A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 cell&#8208;level rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi&#8208;functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge&#8208;doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi&#8208;functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host&#8208;wetting under lean electrolyte. Herein, a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;induced approach is pioneered to create abundant edge&#8208;doping&#8208;sites on an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Boron&#8208;containing carbon dots (BCDs) are elaborately utilized as heteroatom&#8208;introducing agents. Their organic nature facilitates uniform integration of graft&#8208;like BCD units, while their inorganic crystalline cores suppress graphitization of CNF precursors surrounding these graft&#8208;like units via steric&#8208;hindrance during carbonization, promoting bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;B&#8208;doping sites formation. Such a host enables 2 Ah pouch&#8208;type LSBs to achieve an impressive energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with enhanced cyclic stability.

&lt;p&gt;A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cell-level rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi-functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy-to-infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge-doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi-functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host-wetting under lean electrolyte. Herein, a steric-hindrance-induced approach is pioneered to create abundant edge-doping-sites on an easy-to-infiltrate host of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Boron-containing carbon dots (BCDs) are elaborately utilized as heteroatom-introducing agents. Their organic nature facilitates uniform integration of graft-like BCD units, while their inorganic crystalline cores suppress graphitization of CNF precursors surrounding these graft-like units via steric-hindrance during carbonization, promoting bi-functional edge-B-doping sites formation. Such a host enables 2 Ah pouch-type LSBs to achieve an impressive energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with enhanced cyclic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm for innovation design of polymers is emerging as an exciting frontier. The unique chain structure of polymers makes AI processing complex, bringing numerous challenges, such as small data problems and polymer multiscale descriptors.

Abstract
Leveraging the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm for the innovation of advanced polymeric materials is emerging as an exciting frontier in the cross&#8208;disciplinary material community. The big data analysis and prediction capabilities of AI accelerate the discovery and development of polymers with tailored properties. The concept of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design involves a paradigm shift from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation to a more efficient, data&#8208;driven methodology. To date, various AI algorithms have been developed for the structural design and composition optimization of advanced polymeric materials. It mainly involves three steps, including material information digitization and database construction, establishment of AI prediction models, and AI&#8208;based design and optimization. However, the intrinsic data characteristics and intricate relationships between multiscale structure and polymer property pose tough data and modeling challenges. Advanced approaches are proposed to address these challenges, such as digitalizing polymer multiscale structures, implementing multitask and multimodal learning methods, and inverse design and automatic optimization. This review aims to provide an insightful overview of the current state of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design, highlighting the polymer characteristics and corresponding challenges, achievable strategies, and development direction.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Rivalling Large&#8208;Area Flexible Broadband Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive large&#8208;area flexible organic photodetector, based on a cyano&#8208;substituted electron acceptor, has been obtained. It is fully comparable to the commercially available silicon photodiodes in multiple aspects, including detection range, responsivity, and detectivity. The demonstration of various applications in different scenarios and the development of large&#8208;area flexible devices highlight the unique advantages and commercialization prospects of the organic photodetectors. 








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have demonstrated significant advantages as a promising next&#8208;generation photodetection technology, especially for application in flexible and curved image sensing. However, there is still a big gap in device performance between OPDs and commercial silicon photodiodes, which hinders their practical application. Herein, using a novel near&#8208;infrared electron acceptor featuring acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor molecular skeleton and electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;substituted terminal groups, the study reports an OPD that can fully compete with the commercial silicon photodiodes. Benefiting from the strong electron push&#8208;pull effect and large molecular dipole moment, the OPD exhibits a broad detection range from 300 to 1100&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency of 70% at 940&#160;nm. Moreover, owing to the reduced energetic disorder and trap density, the OPD exhibits a picoampere&#8208;level dark current density (1.30 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2) at &#8211;0.1&#160;V bias. Such high responsivity and low dark current density endow the OPD with a detectivity surpassing 1013 Jones across the whole spectral range. More importantly, this superior photodetection performance can be maintained in large&#8208;area flexible device (80 mm2). These results demonstrate the huge potential of OPDs in addressing the limitations of silicon photodiodes for application in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Localized Electrostatic Interaction Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a localized electrostatic interaction strategy using a tailored organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+), to enhance perovskite&#160;stability without introducing any trade&#8208;off. IDPA3+ induces perovskite lattice compression via sterically constrained localized electrostatic interactions, concurrently reinforcing structural stability while suppressing ion migration. Consequently, p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved&#160;a champion efficiency of 25.41% for 1.00 cm2 (certified 25.28%), alongside&#160;exceptional operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C and superior damp&#8208;heat stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for commercialization, yet the weak bonding nature of perovskites renders them vulnerable to external stimuli, undermining the operational longevity of PSCs. Methods aimed at strengthening bonding within perovskite constituents still failed to realize both &#8220;high efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;high stability&#8221; in single device. Herein, a localized electrostatic interaction strategy is proposed by employing an unexplored and well&#8208;designed organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+). IDPA3+ features sterically constrained multi&#8208;interaction sites that enable strong localized electrostatic interactions with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, inducing perovskite lattice compression. This compression improves perovskite lattice energy through strengthened chemical bonding within bulk lattice, ultimately reinforcing structural stability while simultaneously suppressing ion migration. Consequently, modified formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) devices displayed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stability, showing negligible performance loss under continuous operation at 85&#160;&#176;C and damp&#8208;heat test. Notably, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.28% for 1.00 cm2, among the highest published certified PCEs. Overall, this work presents localized electrostatic interaction engineering as a promising strategy to intrinsically stabilize perovskite microstructure, bridging the gap between electrostatic regulation and structural stability while highlighting the broader potential of other triply&#8208;charged organic molecules for advancing stable PSCs and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Isotropic Energy&#8208;Absorbing Metamaterial with Tensegrity&#8208;Inspired Architecture and Auxetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of tensile properties enables adjustment of the spring's stiffness coefficient, achieving overall stiffness regulation while offering self&#8208;recovery and anti&#8208;fatigue capabilities. By leveraging negative Poisson's ratio properties, the seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral metamaterials significantly mitigate impact loads during shock testing. Additionally, the assembly strategy of unit cells is expanded to fabricate multidimensional metamaterials.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials exhibit significant potential for energy absorption applications through rational structural design. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) metamaterials have drawn particular attention due to their unique auxetic behavior, though their limited functionality restricts energy absorption capacity. This study develops a novel metamaterial combining NPR characteristics with tensegrity structure advantages to address traditional energy&#8208;absorbing materials' limitations in durability, self&#8208;recovery, and dynamic adjustability. By reconfiguring tensegrity modules into programmable units using spring combinations and implementing directional deformation constraints through rigid sliding rod and linear slider systems, the auxetic mechanism of NPR materials is integrated with tensegrity's programmable features. Experimental results demonstrate precise control of global auxetic response and overall stiffness through spring stiffness adjustment, with the elastic element combination providing self&#8208;recovery and fatigue resistance (only 0.40% energy absorption variation after 10000 compression cycles). For structural assembly, seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral configurations achieve peak force reductions of &#8776;75.68&#160;&#177;&#160;1.22% and 91.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.40% respectively, under impact, demonstrating assembly strategy scalability. This research breaks through traditional single&#8208;material metamaterial limitations by integrating tensegrity structures with NPR effects, establishing a new paradigm for developing intelligent protective materials with both tunable energy absorption characteristics and enhanced durability.

         <title>Colloidal Heterostructures Enable Interfacial Transport of Immiscible Molecules in Printable Organohydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphase printable organohydrogels with tunable microstructures are developed to control molecular transport pathways for immiscible cargo. The tortuosity and domain size of the colloidal phases are tuned by adjusting temperature and shear during processing, which enables the tailoring of diffusion kinetics due to different transport pathways. This material offers scalable and&#160;adaptable delivery of small molecules without chemical modification of the hydrogel components.








Abstract
Surfactant&#8208;stabilized colloidal emulsions ensure simultaneous transport of immiscible&#160;molecules in hydrogels, but the release of small molecules is restricted by solubility in the continuous phase, or by uncontrolled transport pathways that cause overly slow or rapid release. This study shows that the molecular transport of multiple components through heterostructured organohydrogels can be tuned by adjusting their microstructural tortuosity through temperature and shear. The precursors are thermoresponsive nanoemulsions that contain hydrophilic methylene blue and lipophilic coumarin&#8208;6. Heating or shearing the precursors induces self&#8208;assembly of oil&#8208;rich phase into distinct microstructures through which the release kinetics of both molecules are independently tunable. Mechanistically, lipophilic molecules hop between oil droplets, while hydrophilic molecules traverse water&#8208;rich domains unless the hydrogel mesh size becomes too confined, at which point they undergo accelerated transport at the oil&#8208;water interface. Fluorescent imaging reveals that moderately hydrophilic molecules localize at the charged oil&#8208;water boundary, providing evidence for interfacial migration consistent with the acceleration in hydrophilic solute transport. The organohydrogels can be synthesized with bespoke form factors and diffusion coefficients that vary with processing parameters. Because the nanoemulsion precursor is compatible with continuous manufacturing methods, it can lead to scalable gels that possess powerful delivery properties without complex modification or formulation steps.

         <title>Circumventing Self&#8208;Diffusion Enables High&#8208;Rate Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) as the primary factor hindering the rate capability of hard carbon. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier in the low potential.








Abstract
Hard carbons (HCs) are promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), yet their application faces a critical challenge that sluggish kinetics in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) severely limit fast&#8208;charging capability, and the origin of this limitation remains unclear. Here, this study reveals slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters as the fundamental barrier of hard carbons, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in/ex situ characterizations. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier at the low potential. The optimized HCs achieve a high reversible capacity (386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (312 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and robust long&#8208;term cyclic stability (98% after 1000 cycles) in a conventional ester electrolyte, with energy density and power density surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These findings provide fundamental insights into high&#8208;rate hard carbons for advanced SIBs.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Length&#8208;Selective Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Regulation via Competitive and Cooperative Pathways in Solid&#8208;State Macrocyclic Host&#8211;Guest Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode macrocyclic host&#8211;guest approach enables chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective modulation of solid&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer interactions via competitive and cooperative pathways, achieving aldehyde&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered structural reorganization, switchable vapochromic sensing, and dynamically tunable photothermal conversion efficiency in responsive organic cocrystals.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions in the solid state remains a key challenge in developing responsive functional materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode supramolecular strategy&#8212;is reported based on competitive and cooperative host&#8211;guest interactions&#8212;for constructing dynamic macrocycle&#8208;based CT complexes with tunable optical and photothermal properties in response to aliphatic aldehyde vapors. Two pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic hosts, EtLP6 and EtFLP6, form disordered CT assemblies with F4TCNQ via solvent&#8208;free grinding. These CT complexes exhibit chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent vapochromic behavior governed by distinct mechanisms: guest&#8208;triggered disassembly or reassembly of D&#8211;A structures in EtLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (competitive regulation), and aldehyde&#8208;assisted ternary CT assembly in EtFLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (cooperative regulation). Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal vapor&#8208;induced structural transformations that correlate directly with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption changes. Notably, such CT&#8208;state modulation enables the first vapor&#8208;regulated organic photothermal cocrystal system, with conversion efficiency tunable from non&#8208;detectable levels to over 11% under 808&#160;nm irradiation. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing solid&#8208;state supramolecular materials with multi&#8208;responsive optical and thermal functions via macrocyclic host&#8211;guest chemistry.

         <title>Non&#8208;Monotonic Sequence Control Maximizes Spin Transport in Conjugated Polymers at Room&#8208;Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing the repeat&#8208;unit sequence of a conjugated backbone tightens &#960;&#8211;&#960; spacing and builds long&#8208;range order, thereby lengthening spin lifetimes and relaxation length. These metrics do not rise monotonically with sequence order. A multicomponent regioregular sequence gives moderate cohesion, long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; order, and &#8776;8% non&#8208;tunneling magnetoresistance at 300&#160;K, guiding designs that extend spin lifetimes and relaxation length.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors have long spin lifetimes supporting non&#8208;tunneling spin transport at room temperature, providing a window to control spin transport and enable charge&#8208;spin co&#8208;processing. Programmable diversity in backbones and side chains expands the design space for tuning structure&#8208;transport relationships, yet links between structure and spin transport remain less explored than for charge transport. Focusing on repeat&#8208;unit sequence effects on spin transport, a nonmonotonic dependence where intermediate sequence order optimizes &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing by balancing long&#8208;range coherence and chain flexibility, maximizing spin&#8208;transport efficiency is revealed. The&#160;three&#8208;component regioregular copolymer tightens &#960;&#8211;&#960; spacing to 3.48&#160;&#197; and extends coherence, yielding mobility 0.43&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio near 6 &#215; 106. Stronger cohesion in a bicomponent alternating species flattens the backbone yet widens d&#960; and shortens coherence; frontier levels and dihedral angles support this microstructural origin of lower mobility. Electron paramagnetic resonance gives a T1 of 101&#160;ns for the alternating copolymer; spin valves show &gt;8% room&#8208;temperature non&#8208;tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, &#8776;200% above bicomponent alternating species. This non&#8208;monotonic design rule provides a synthesis strategy to extend spin lifetimes and spin diffusion length, thereby advancing conjugated polymers for applications in logic, memory, sensing, and wearable systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site Strategy Underpins Stable Unimodal Deep&#8208;Blue Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site strategy is innovatively proposed to underpin stable unimodal deep&#8208;blue perovskite emission. The new approach suppresses phase segregation and eliminates green emission in blue perovskite emitters by controlling energy transfer dynamics. This study provides the first mechanistic explanation of this process and offers a universal design rule to prevent spectral instability in single&#8208;halide blue perovskite emitters.








Abstract
The operational stability of mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic halide ion migration. Employing single&#8208;halide perovskite systems represents a viable route to circumvent this issue, yet solution&#8208;processed pure&#8208;bromide perovskites typically exhibit undesirable green emission, impeding attainment of high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue electroluminescence. Herein, this challenge is addressed through the strategic incorporation of Mg2+ into the B&#8208;site of the pure bromine&#8208;based perovskite lattice. This substitution induces a substantial spectral blueshift and promotes phase homogenization by facilitating efficient energy transfer from small&#8208;n to large&#8208;n phases. Notably, the first systematic investigation and mechanistic elucidation of the origin of bimodal emission in blue PeLEDs is presented. Consequently, the champion PeLED delivers stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 464&#160;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.76%. This study presents a definitive paradigm for achieving spectrally stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission from single&#8208;halide perovskites. The elucidated mechanism underlying emission bimodality provides critical guidance for future development of blue PeLEDs.

     alt="Dual-B-Site Strategy Underpins Stable Unimodal Deep-Blue Emitting Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual-B-Site strategy is innovatively proposed to underpin stable unimodal deep-blue perovskite emission. The new approach suppresses phase segregation and eliminates green emission in blue perovskite emitters by controlling energy transfer dynamics. This study provides the first mechanistic explanation of this process and offers a universal design rule to prevent spectral instability in single-halide blue perovskite emitters.

         <title>Unraveling In&#8208;Plane Crystallographic Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Memory Performance In Van Der Waals &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 Ferroelectric Semiconductor Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

This study demonstrates that the in&#8208;plane crystallographic anisotropy of the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is a critical determinant of ferroelectric switching dynamics and memory performance. Our results reveal orientation&#8208;dependent transport pathways, Schottky barrier modulation, and electrostatic potential energy that dictate polarization reversal and synaptic functionality.








Abstract
The ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FeS&#8208;FETs) based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 emerge as promising non&#8208;volatile memory devices. However, the intrinsic in&#8208;plane (IP) crystallographic anisotropy of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 introduces orientation dependence, leading to pronounced variations in memory performance depending on the IP alignment of the source/drain (S/D) contacts. This study presents the first demonstration of IP anisotropy&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 FeS&#8208;FETs with S/D contacts aligned along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. The AC&#8208;aligned S/D configuration achieves a ferroelectric resistance switching (FRS) ratio of 6.42, an on/off current ratio of 4.53 &#215; 104, and a normalized memory window (MW) of 59 %, whereas the ZZ&#8208;aligned counterpart exhibits an FRS ratio of 1.05, an on/off ratio of 5.25, and negligible MW. The electron transports proceed through twisted pathways along the AC direction, but proceed along a straight trajectory in the ZZ direction to avoid high&#8208;energy barrier regions due to the threefold rotational symmetric lattice. Thus, the excessive electron transmission and a reduced Schottky barrier height effectively screen the influence of ferroelectric bound charges in the ZZ&#8208;aligned S/D contacts. These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3, offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS&#8208;FETs.

Measuring Zn Transference
This study shows that Zn ion transport critically governs Zn battery performance. While adding potassium co&#8208;salt boosts conductivity, it lowers Zn ion transference, causing concentration gradients and unstable plating (dendrites). Conversely, higher Zn ion transport facilitates uniform deposits and durable cycling &#8212; highlighting that conductivity alone cannot guarantee dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. More details can be found in the Research Article by Maria R. Lukatskaya and co&#8208;workers (10.1002/adma.202502245).

         <title>Toward Zero&#8208;Excess Alkali Metal Batteries: Bridging Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries, highlighting anode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, metal nucleation, dendrite growth, and SEI formation while comparing Li, Na, and K metals. It critically examines electrolyte and separator roles, emphasizing substrate design, electrolyte modifications, interfacial engineering, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Experimental and computational advancements are integrated to guide future developments.








Abstract
This review introduces alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries and conveys a synopsis of the current challenges regarding anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. The review focuses on a critical analysis of the fundamental understanding of the (eletro)chemical and (electro)physical processes occurring at the anode, including metal nucleation and dendrite growth, the properties of liquid and solid electrolytes, and their roles in the metal stripping/deposition process and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, and the properties of separators and their role in inhibiting dendrite growth. Solutions to tackle the challenges for anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries are discussed extensively in the aspects of the modifications of the anode substrate, novel electrolyte solutions and SEI structures, interface design, and novel separators/solid&#8208;state electrolytes to enable stable battery performances. To highlight the importance of bridging experimental and computational insights, experimental progress derived from a range of advanced characterization techniques is analyzed in combination with the advancement in multi&#8208;scale theory and computational modeling. Finally, outlooks are provided from both experimental and computational points of view for the exciting field of zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries.

Transition metal ions migration is the fundamental science for layered oxides of Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries and demands more efforts in this direction. In this review, the Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions migration in layered oxides, covering the key thermodynamic and kinetic factors, universal and specific migration characteristics, effects on the electrochemical performance, optimization strategies, and characterization techniques, are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries are promising systems for powering electric vehicles and grid storage. Layered 3d transition metal oxides AxTMO2 (A = Li, Na; TM = 3d transition metals; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2) have drawn extensive attention as cathode materials due to their exceptional energy densities. However, they suffer from several technical challenges caused by crystal structure degradation associated with TM ions migration, such as poor cycling stability, inferior rate capability, significant voltage hysteresis, and serious voltage decay. Aiming to tackle these challenges, this review provides an in&#8208;depth discussion and comprehensive understanding of the TM ions migration behaviors in AxTMO2. First, the key thermodynamics and kinetics that impact TM ions migration are discussed, covering ionic radius, electronic configuration, crystal structure arrangement, and migration energy barrier. In particular, details are provided regarding the universal and specific migration characteristics of Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions in layered cathode materials. Subsequently, the impacts of these migrations on electrochemical performance are emphasized in terms of the fundamental science behind technical issues, and strategies to modulate TM ions migration for advanced cathode materials development are summarized. Besides, characterization techniques for probing the TM ions migration are present, like neutron diffraction (ND), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and others. Finally, future directions in this regard are comprehensively concluded. This review offers valuable insights into the basic design of advanced layered oxide cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Functional Hydrogels for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the role of functional hydrogels in advancing aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), focusing on essential properties like mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and degradability. Integration challenges, modification strategies, and future directions for hydrogels to support AZB commercialization and bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) hold great potential for green grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their affordability, resource abundance, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges related to the electrode, electrolyte, and interface. Functional hydrogels offer a promising solution to address such challenges owing to their broad electrochemical window, tunable structures, and pressure&#8208;responsive mechanical properties. In this review, the key properties that functional hydrogels must possess for advancing AZBs, including mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, swelling behavior, and degradability, from a perspective of the full life cycle of hydrogels in AZBs are summarized. Current modification strategies aimed at enhancing these properties and improving AZB performance are also explored. The challenges and design considerations for integrating functional hydrogels with electrodes and interface are discussed. In the end, the limitations and future directions for hydrogels to bridge the gap between academia and industries for the successful deployment of AZBs are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Significant progress is made in PIBs over the past decade, but the improvements based on half&#8208;cell testing, low mass loading, and low energy density are insufficient for practical applications. This review summarizes the challenges and strategies for PIBs, highlights the importance of further research focusing on full cells, and provides an analysis of their practical application potential.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), with abundant resources and low cost, are considered as a promising alternative to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Over the past decade, significant academic progresses are made in the development of PIBs, including advancements in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. However, most improvements are achieved under laboratory conditions (e.g., K metal&#8208;based half&#8208;cells and low mass loading of active materials), and the performance of PIBs in full cells is still far from the requirements for commercial applications. A critical insight bridging the academic research and the commercialization of PIBs is urgently needed to guide future research in this field. This review will discuss the challenges and improvement strategies in the development of PIBs, focusing on the potential practical cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, as well as their performance in full cells. It aims to give the readers a clear and logical understanding of the development of PIBs. The application analysis is also discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the commercialization potential of PIBs. Finally, perspectives are provided for the future development of PIBs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Scalable, High&#8208;Mass Loaded Electrodes for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid&#8208;scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.








Abstract
The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high&#8208;mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape&#8208;cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition. A variety of materials are covered with the most prominent being LiFe(PO4) (LFP), LiCoO2(LCO), and MnO2. In research to date, scalable electrochemical performance has been achieved with mass loadings over 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Areal capacities as high as 14.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.82&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 have been achieved in non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes and 9.8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in aqueous electrolytes. These results establish that the mass loading of electrodes can be scaled up without compromising their electrochemical properties.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities for Rechargeable Aqueous Sn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable aqueous batteries with metal anodes promise enhanced energy density, combining higher output voltage and capacity with high safety. This perspective highlights the emerging potential of the Sn metal anode, emphasizing its resistance to hydrogen evolution, high reversibility, and sustainability. Key challenges, including dead Sn formation and electrolyte evolution, as well as innovative design strategies for robust Sn&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. The development of Sn metal batteries could contribute to a sustainable society.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on metallic anodes hold tremendous potential of high energy density enabled by the combination of relatively low working potential and large capacity while retaining the intrinsic safety nature and economical value of aqueous systems; However, the realization of these promised advantages relies on the identification of an ideal metal anode chemistry with all these merits. In this review, the emerging Sn metal anode chemistry is examined as such an anode candidate in both acidic and alkaline media, where the inertness of Sn toward hydrogen evolution, flat low voltage profile, and low polarization make it a unique metal anode for aqueous batteries. From a panoramic viewpoint, the key challenges and detrimental issues of Sn metal batteries are discussed, including dead Sn formation, self&#8208;discharge, and electrolyte degradation, as well as strategies for mitigating these issues by constructing robust Sn anodes. New design approaches for more durable and reliable Sn metal batteries are also discussed, with the aim of fully realizing the potential of Sn anode chemistry.

Abstract
Traditional aqueous electrolytes have a limited electrochemical stability window due to the decomposition voltage of water (&#8776;1.23&#160;V). &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes, which expand the stability window of aqueous electrolytes from 1.23 to 3&#160;V and spark a global surge of research in aqueous batteries, are developed. This breakthrough reveals novel aspects of solvation structure, ion transport mechanisms, and interfacial properties in WIS electrolytes, marking the start of a new era in solution chemistry that extends beyond traditional dilute electrolytes and has implications across electrolyte research. This review presents the current mechanistic understanding of WIS electrolytes and their derivative designs, focusing on the construction of solvation structures. The insights gained and limitations encountered in bulk solvation structure engineering are further discussed. Finally, future directions beyond WIS for advancing aqueous electrolyte design are proposed.

         <title>Disordered Rocksalts as High&#8208;Energy and Earth&#8208;Abundant Li&#8208;Ion Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) offer a new direction in Li&#8208;ion cathode design beyond conventional Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based materials. This review highlights the design principles, synthesis strategies, and performance optimization of DRX oxides and oxyfluorides for energy&#8208;dense, sustainable batteries using Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals and tailored cation disorder.









Abstract
To address the growing demand for energy and support the shift toward transportation electrification and intermittent renewable energy, there is an urgent need for low&#8208;cost, energy&#8208;dense electrical storage. Research on Li&#8208;ion electrode materials has predominantly focused on ordered materials with well&#8208;defined lithium diffusion channels, limiting cathode design to resource&#8208;constrained Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based oxides and lower&#8208;energy polyanion compounds. Recently, disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) have demonstrated high capacity and energy density when lithium excess and/or local ordering allow statistical percolation of lithium sites through the structure. This cation disorder can be induced by high temperature synthesis or mechanochemical synthesis methods for a broad range of compositions. DRX oxides and oxyfluorides containing Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals have been prepared using various synthesis routes, including solid&#8208;state, molten&#8208;salt, and sol&#8208;gel reactions. This review outlines DRX design principles and explains the effect of synthesis conditions on cation disorder and short&#8208;range cation ordering (SRO), which determines the cycling stability and rate capability. In addition, strategies to enhance Li transport and capacity retention with Mn&#8208;rich DRX possessing partial spinel&#8208;like ordering are discussed. Finally, the review considers the optimization of carbon and electrolyte in DRX materials and addresses key challenges and opportunities for commercializing DRX cathodes.

         <title>Measuring Zn Transference with Precision: Insights for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified Hittorf method reveals how co&#8208;salt composition affects Zn2+ transference numbers. Coupled with molecular dynamics and spectroscopy, we shows that electrolytes with high Zn transference number (tZn) suppress dendrites, enabling longer high&#8208;rate cycling and more stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.


Abstract
Electrolyte engineering in Zn&#8208;metal batteries frequently employs alkaline metal salts to enhance conductivity and reduce overpotential for Zn plating. While these additives improve conductivity, the presence of more mobile alkali cations can negatively affect the Zn2+ transference number. Optimizing this property is crucial for high&#8208;rate performance, efficiency, and safety, as high Zn2+ transference number minimizes concentration polarization and dendrite formation during high&#8208;current cycling. However, reliably measuring the transference number in non&#8208;binary electrolytes presents significant experimental challenges due to dynamic Zn metal interfaces, rendering traditional methods ineffective. Here, we use a modified Hittorf&#8208;type method to measure Zn2+ transference numbers in complex electrolytes. Supported by molecular dynamics&#160;simulations, this method is applied to obtain transference numbers of Zn2+, K+, and acetate ions in Zn&#8208;K acetate electrolytes. By varying the Zn2+ fraction, the impact of co&#8208;salts on transport properties is studied and correlated with the Zn solvation environment using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. It is revealed that while ionic conductivity increases with the addition of KOAc co&#8208;salt, the Zn2+ transference number dramatically decreases. Electrolytes with higher Zn2+ transference numbers enable longer high&#8208;rate cycling, underscoring the importance of optimizing Zn2+ transference for improved performance of Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>A Disordered Rock Salt Anode for Long&#8208;Lived All&#8208;Vanadium Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery using a novel disordered rock salt anode, DRS&#8208;NVO, delivers long life, fast charging, and high efficiency. This system retains 80% capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles, with over 93% energy efficiency. Combining low&#8208;cost materials with stable performance, it presents a scalable and recyclable solution for future grid&#8208;level energy storage.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries wherein both the cathode and the anode are vanadium&#8208;based phases are promising grid&#8208;energy storage candidates, offering long cycle life and easy recycling. However, their system&#8208;level energy density must be improved to lower their footprint and operating costs. In this work, an all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery that uses a new disordered rock salt (DRS) anode, Na3V2O5 (DRS&#8208;NVO), is proposed. For DRS&#8208;NVO, &#8776;2 Na+ ions can be reversibly cycled at &#8776;0.7&#160;V versus Na/Na+. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis reveal increased local distortions during Na+ insertion but the overall DRS structure is maintained. The material shows exceptional stability and rate capability, achieving 10&#160;000 cycles in half&#8208;cell tests at rates of up to 20 C. Molecular dynamics simulations produce voltage profiles and ion diffusivities in good agreement with experimental results. Pairing the DRS&#8208;NVO anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode yields a cell (NVO|NVP) voltage of 2.7&#160;V, with symmetric voltage profiles and an energy efficiency &gt;93%. This all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery exhibits excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of its capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles. Levelized cost&#8208;of&#8208;storage (LCOS) evaluations based on a cell design model confirm the cost&#8208;effectiveness, positioning NVO|NVP as a competitive grid&#8208;scale energy storage solution.

         <title>FeNb2O6 as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Structural Amorphization Coupled with NbO6 Local Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeNb2O6 is applied for the first time as a high&#8208;performance anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The presence of iron disrupts the long&#8208;range order by local disorder of the FeO6 octahedra during initial sodiation. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes establishes a robust intercalation host that maintains abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive intercalation and enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion pathways.








Abstract
Pseudocapacitance&#8208;type transition metal oxides have been extensively investigated as anodes&#160;for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Currently, they are also gaining attention&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low volume change and safety. However, their performance in sodium storage remains limited, primarily due to the larger Na+ ion radius. Here, for the first time, an iron niobate is reported with a columbite structure as a high&#8208;performance sodium storage anode. The presence of iron triggers&#160;the loss of long&#8208;range order through disorder of the FeO6 octahedra local structure, subsequently allowing reversible sodium storage in an amorphous phase. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes creates a &#8220;skeleton&#8221; that offers abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive ion storage and enhanced ion diffusion pathways. These characteristics of FeNb2O6 make it an effective intercalation host, offering high capacity along with fast Na+ kinetics, as demonstrated through operando and ex situ characterizations. It leads to an applicable reversible capacity (&gt;300 mAh g&#8722;1) with a favorable average voltage of &#8776;0.6&#160;V and excellent rate capability (180.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 2 A g&#8722;1). This study provides insights into the development of intrinsically active transition metal oxides for Na+&#8208;ion intercalation.

         <title>Ultrahigh Plateau&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage by Plugging Open Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;plateau&#8208;capacity (490 mAh g&#8722;1 below 0.25 V) hard carbon is synthesized through chemical activation of biomass wastes and subsequent catalytic decomposition of industrial&#8208;grade solvents (here acetonitrile). The detailed structure&#8211;property&#8208;performance relationship is articulated.








Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), and a precise adjustment of the pore structure is the key to achieving high plateau&#8208;capacity. In this work, composite hard carbon is developed by integrating graphitic carbon with biomass waste (banana peel)&#8208;derived activated carbon (AC). In this design, N&#8208;doped pseudographite layer is stacked at the entrance of open pores, forming a long&#8208;range graphitic layer without excessive graphitization. As a result, the surface area of AC is decreased by 170 times down to less than 10&#160;m3 g&#8722;1, and the corresponding open pores are in situ converted into closed pores. In an optimized electrolyte solvation structure, the obtained HC anode achieves the reversible sodium&#8208;storage capacity up to 524 mAh g&#8722;1. In particular, a large portion of the capacity (490 mAh g&#8722;1) lies below the plateau of 0.25&#160;V, which originates from the pore&#8208;filling mechanism as revealed by in situ Raman. This study provides a straightforward method to modulate the pore structure of carbon materials, and an energy&#8208;efficient (900 &#176;C) synthesis for HC compared to traditional high&#8208;temperature routes (e.g., &#8776;1300&#8211;2000 &#176;C).

         <title>Untangling the Role of Capping Agents in Manipulating Electrochemical Behaviors Toward Practical Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, the role of capping agents in manipulating the electrochemical behaviors of AZIBs is untangled. The multifunctional role of the capping agents in terms of the Zn anode, electrolyte, and cathode validates stable and practical AZIBs.








Abstract
Long&#8208;standing challenges including notorious side reactions at the Zn anode, low Zn anode utilization, and rapid cathode degradation at low current densities hinder the advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, a series of capping agents are employed to demonstrate their applicability in AZIBs. Here, it is shown that the preferential adsorption of capping agents on different Zn crystal planes, coordination between capping agents and Zn2+ ions, and interactions with metal oxide cathodes enable preferred Zn (002) deposition, water&#8208;deficient Zn2+ ion solvation structure, and a dynamic cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Benefiting from the multi&#8208;functional role of capping agents, dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating and stripping with an improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability are realized. Remarkable capacity retention of 91% is achieved for cathodes after more than 500 cycles under a low current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, marking one of the best cycling stabilities to date. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of capping agents in manipulating electrochemical behaviors, which should inspire and pave a new avenue of research to address the challenges in practical energy storage beyond AZIBs.

         <title>Edge Electron Effect Induced High&#8208;Entropy SEI for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific facet boundary and electron&#8208;donating property of flower edges zinc&#8208;modified aluminum substrate (E&#8208;Zn@Al) enhances anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane and accelerates anion/solvent decomposition. This process results in a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, and ensures high&#8208;density sodium nucleation and pyknotic growth. Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability under ultrahigh cathode loading.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries represent great promising as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and resource&#8208;rich electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the savage growth of sodium metal and continuous consumption hinder its stable capacity output. Herein, ordered flower&#8208;edges of zinc on Al substrate can induce high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to adjust sodium uniform deposition and extremely reduce electrolyte consumption with ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (97.05%) for prolong batteries cycling life. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the electron&#8208;donating property and exposed edge sites between (100) and (101) facets in zinc flower enhance anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane accelerating its interface decomposition. Additionally, the ordered zinc edges serve as homogeneous&#8208;nucleating template, leading to thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer (18 nm, ZnF2, NaZn13, NaF, and Na2CO3) with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, so that fast and high&#8208;flux Na ions transport field, thereby reducing the critical nucleation barrier and promoting sodium high density nucleation (7.36 &#215; 1013 N cm&#8722;2) and pyknotic growth (3 mAh cm&#8722;2, 22&#160;&#181;m). The assembled anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability (86%, 90 cycles) under ultrahigh cathode loading (32 mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the anode&#8208;less single&#8208;layer pouch batteries exhibit a durable capacity retention of 99% after 600 cycles.

         <title>Expandable Fast Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion Network of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Oxides via Single&#8208;Layer LiCo(Ni)O2 Segregation</title>

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;layer LiCo(Ni)O2 segregation layers are uniformly distributed within the Li2MnO3 domains of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, initially forming a homogeneous dual&#8208;phase structure. These segregation layers create a fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network. Furthermore, they help to uniformly divide the large Li2MnO3 domains into nano&#8208;sized islands, effectively preventing the formation of oxygen percolation networks and enhancing the stability of anion redox reactions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials exhibit a remarkable reversible specific capacity exceeding 250 mAh g&#8722;1, positioning them as the preferred choice for the next generation of high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. However, their inferior rate and cycling performance pose significant challenges. In this context, a Li&#8208;rich material incorporating an expanded fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network has been successfully synthesized. This advancement involves the introduction of a single&#8208;layer of LiCo(Ni)O2 with high Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficients into the crystal structure of Li&#8208;rich cathode, thereby enhancing the rate performance, achieving an impressive capacity of 212 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Furthermore, the single&#8208;layer LiCo(Ni)O2 can effectively isolates Li2MnO3 phase domains, thereby enhancing the structural stability during the anion redox process, consequently extending the electrochemical stability limits. Operating within a voltage range of 2.1&#8211;4.6&#160;V, the capacity retention reaches 80% after 400 cycles, with a voltage decay of merely 0.74&#160;mV per cycle. This innovative utilization of an expanded fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network provides invaluable insights that will guide the development of strategies aimed at unlocking rate capability in layered oxide cathode materials.

         <title>All&#8208;Climate Energy&#8208;Dense Cascade Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries Enabled by a Polycationic Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is seriously restricted by their low energy density and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) is designed to realize an energy&#8208;dense Zn&#8208;I2 battery with cascade I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; redox couples over a widen temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical development of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I0/I&#8722; conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy&#8208;dense cascade aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br0/Br&#8722;. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I+/I0 redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; are achieved with the assistance of &#8722;NR3+ units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a low I2 loading of 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 or 760 mAh g&#8722;1 based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries, specifically tailored for wide&#8208;temperature operation.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Doped Sodium Vanadate Cathode for Improved Zn Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>

An iodine&#8208;doping strategy is developed to modify the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, effectively reducing the electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure. This modification enables faster diffusion and higher storage capacity of zinc ions.








Abstract
The electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure significantly limits the practicality of vanadium&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, an anion doping strategy is demonstrated to mitigate electrostatic resistance and steric hindrance during zinc ion insertion by incorporating iodine atoms into the lattice of the cathode material, Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O. Iodine doping reduces the adsorption energy at the most stable site, thereby weakening the Zn2+&#8208;host interaction and lowering the Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier, resulting in a one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the large atomic size of iodine expands the host lattice, creating ample space for increased zinc ion storage capacity, further supported by the introduced oxygen vacancies. As a result, the iodine&#8208;doped Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode achieves an impressive specific capacity of 528.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and retains 262&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12,000 cycles at a high current rate of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Cu&#8208;Mn&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogs for Practical Sodium Ion Cylinder Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective ternary Prussian blue analog is synthesized via structural regulation to achieve the compatibility of high capacity and long lifespan for sodium&#8208;ion batteries within a wide temperature range. Mn and Cu synergistically enhances conductivity, operating voltage, and stability, suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions. This design enables high&#8208;loading 18650&#8208;type cells with exceptional electrochemical performance, supporting grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective cathodes are essential for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have shown great potential as SIB cathodes, but achieving both high capacity and long lifespan remains challenging. In this study, a series of low&#8208;cost ternary PBAs synthesized through structural regulation is presented to simultaneously achieve high capacity, stable cycling performance, and broad temperature adaptability. Among them, CuHCF&#8208;3 demonstrates a specific capacity of 132.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 73.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. In&#8208;depth analyses, using in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations, reveal a highly reversible three&#8208;phase transition (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal) in Na1.96Cu0.45Mn0.55[Fe(CN)6]0.91&#183;&#9633;0.09&#183;2.14H2O (CuHCF&#8208;3), which is driven by synergistic interactions between Mn and Cu. Mn enhances conductivity, increases the operating voltage, and introduces additional redox centers, while Cu mitigates the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions associated with Mn and buffers volume changes during cycling. This structural synergy results in excellent temperature stability across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 55&#160;&#176;C). 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells based on CuHCF&#8208;3 with high loading density achieve 73.54% capacity retention over 850 cycles. This study offers valuable insights for designing durable, high&#8208;capacity electrode materials for SIB energy storage applications.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have shown great potential as SIB cathodes, but achieving both high capacity and long lifespan remains challenging. In this study, a series of low-cost ternary PBAs synthesized through structural regulation is presented to simultaneously achieve high capacity, stable cycling performance, and broad temperature adaptability. Among them, CuHCF-3 demonstrates a specific capacity of 132.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 73.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. In-depth analyses, using in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations, reveal a highly reversible three-phase transition (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal) in Na&lt;sub&gt;1.96&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;2.14H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (CuHCF-3), which is driven by synergistic interactions between Mn and Cu. Mn enhances conductivity, increases the operating voltage, and introduces additional redox centers, while Cu mitigates the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions associated with Mn and buffers volume changes during cycling. This structural synergy results in excellent temperature stability across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 55&#160;&#176;C). 18650-type cylindrical cells based on CuHCF-3 with high loading density achieve 73.54% capacity retention over 850 cycles. This study offers valuable insights for designing durable, high-capacity electrode materials for SIB energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyper&#8208;Crosslinking to Customize Ultrathin&#8208;Wall Closed Pores in Pitch&#8208;Derived Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy to molecularly reconstruct pitch and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of derived carbon. This strategy enables the structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly disordered carbon with abundant closed&#8208;pore featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). This work advances the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials.








Abstract
Pitch is a highly preferable and cost&#8208;effective precursor of carbon materials. Nevertheless, its direct pyrolysis typically yields highly graphitized soft carbon, posing challenges to the modulation of closed&#8208;pore architecture, due to intense intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This results in a negligible plateau capacity and sluggish diffusion kinetics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this study, an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to reconstruct pitch molecularly and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of the derived carbon. The crosslinker intertwined the pitch units, transforming the linear molecules into 3D porous polymers. Structurally, these 3D cavities tactfully reserved space for forming closed&#8208;pore cores, with the single&#8208;layer pitch network skeleton transforming into ultrathin pore walls upon carbonization. This strategy enabled the disruption of intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and, therefore, inhibited structural ordering, facilitating a structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly&#8208;disordered carbon with abundant closed pores featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). The optimal sample delivered a high capacity of 370&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, as well as a rate capability that surpassed those of most previously reported pitch&#8208;derived carbons. Hyper&#8208;crosslinking has advanced the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>A Multifunctional Binder for Current&#8208;Collector&#8208;Free Zn Powder Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing abundant polar groups as Zn2+ absorption sites and hydrogen bond arrays, a protein structure&#8208;derived binder for ZP anode and iodine cathode is proposed. This design can regulate the Zn2+ flux, benefit the formation of free&#8208;standing electrode, inhibit the side reactions, suppress the shuttle effect of polyiodides, and enable the large&#8208;scale potentials.








Abstract
Compared with commonly used Zn foil anodes, Zn powder (ZP) anodes offer superior versatility and processability. However, in aqueous electrolytes, dendrite growth and side reactions, such as corrosion and hydrogen evolution, become more severe in ZP anodes than those in Zn foil anodes because of the rough surfaces and high surface areas of ZP, leading to poor reversibility and limitations in high&#8208;loading mass cathodes. In this study, a diisocyanate&#8208;polytetrahydrofuran&#8208;dihydrazide polymer (DDP) binder is developed, inspired by protein structures. The strong Zn2+ adsorption capability of the binder effectively regulates Zn2+ flux, while its unique hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays facilitate the formation of a free&#8208;standing ZP anode and inhibit side reactions. The binder exhibits superior mechanical performance, providing ZP electrodes with excellent resistance to various mechanical stresses, including tensile, nanoindentation, scratch, and dynamic bending tests. ZP symmetric cells achieve stable cycling at capacities of 2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. In addition, DDP functions as an iodine cathode, effectively mitigating the polyiodide shuttle effect. The fabricated ZP/DDP||I2/DDP full cells demonstrate an excellent rate capability and cycling stability, even under a high&#8208;loading conditions. This study presents a novel approach for preparing stable ZP anodes and iodine cathodes, offering a promising strategy for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Revealing the Catalysis Modes for Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Molten Salt Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) loaded with various metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is constructed as a sulfur host for molten salt Al&#8208;S batteries, and the effects of different SACs on the reaction kinetics of the sulfur positive electrodes are examined. Based on strong anchoring of polysulfides and regulation of the conversion rate kinetics at different stages, the CoNC@S positive electrode achieves stable cycling up to 6000 cycles.








Abstract
Molten salt aluminum&#8208;sulfur (MSAS) batteries operated at a sub&#8208;water&#8208;boiling temperature are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of the low costs along with moderate energy density. However, the sulfur positive electrode is plagued by the sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides, which hampers the rate and cycling performance. Herein, carbon materials integrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are utilized as the model sulfur hosts for MSAS batteries and comprehensively investigate the active modes of these SACs on cell performance. Results show that the cell utilizing cobalt&#8208;SACs shows an initial specific capacity of 1064&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, retaining 88.5% capacity after 100 cycles. Even at 3C, the cell achieves a specific capacity of 533&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and demonstrates record&#8208;long cycle performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of only 0.0014% per cycle over 6000 cycles. By combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, a new mechanism is undercovered wherein &#8211; owed to differentiated binding toward varied Al&#8208;polysulfides &#8211; the cobalt&#8208;SAC tunes down the conversion of long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides while accelerating that from short&#8208;chain polysulfides to solid Al2S3. This mechanism alleviates polysulfide accumulation in the molten salt electrolyte, mitigates the shuttle effect, and enhances the overall sulfur reaction kinetics.

         <title>A Perspective on Pathways Toward Commercial Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analysis of the existing and prospective sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) systems unveils that a wider application of SIBs should primarily focus on i) regulating the composition, morphology, surface chemistry, safety performance, and production feasibility of mainstream cathodes, ii) enhancing the high&#8208;voltage stability, film formation ability, and cost effectiveness of electrolytes, and iii) reducing irreversible capacity loss and interphase growth of hard carbon anodes based on well&#8208;understood sodium&#8208;ion storage mechanisms.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely adopted in the automotive industry, with an annual global production exceeding 1000&#160;GWh. Despite their success, the escalating demand for LIBs has created concerns on supply chain issues related to key elements, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium and other raw materials. Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs, particularly for grid storage and automotive applications, faces significant hurdles. This perspective article aims to identify the critical challenges in making SIBs viable from both chemical and techno&#8208;economic perspectives. First, a brief comparison of the materials chemistry, working mechanisms, and cost between mainstream LIB systems and prospective SIB systems is provided. The intrinsic challenges of SIBs regarding storage stability, capacity utilization, cycle stability, calendar life, and safe operation of cathode, electrolyte, and anode materials are discussed. Furthermore, issues related to the scalability of material production, materials engineering feasibility, and energy&#8208;dense electrode design and fabrication are illustrated. Finally, promising pathways are listed and discussed toward achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, stable, cost&#8208;effective SIBs.

Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs, particularly for grid storage and automotive applications, faces significant hurdles. This perspective article aims to identify the critical challenges in making SIBs viable from both chemical and techno-economic perspectives. First, a brief comparison of the materials chemistry, working mechanisms, and cost between mainstream LIB systems and prospective SIB systems is provided. The intrinsic challenges of SIBs regarding storage stability, capacity utilization, cycle stability, calendar life, and safe operation of cathode, electrolyte, and anode materials are discussed. Furthermore, issues related to the scalability of material production, materials engineering feasibility, and energy-dense electrode design and fabrication are illustrated. Finally, promising pathways are listed and discussed toward achieving high-energy-density, stable, cost-effective SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Liquid Metal Composites for Soft Electronics and E&#8208;Waste Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM) composites embody recyclability, repairability, renewability, and resilience (4R), offering a sustainable route for soft electronics. With exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and eco&#8208;friendly recovery, these systems enable closed&#8208;loop lifecycles and reduce e&#8208;waste. Their integration paves the way for wearable, flexible, and recyclable devices that support a circular electronics economy.








Abstract
There has been tremendous progress in soft printable electronics with liquid metal (LM) for creating elastic, stretchable, and thin&#8208;film circuitry. However, such innovation risks outpacing sustainability. As the world moves toward softer, thinner, and more integrated electronics, these advancements may accelerate the exponential rise of electronic waste&#8212;projected to surpass 74 million tons by 2030 and reach &#8776;120 million tons by 2050. Therefore, in developing LM&#8208;based electronics, it is critical to address the urgent need for eco&#8208;friendly recycling strategies. This review proposes a paradigm shift toward recyclable, repairable, renewable, and resilient (&#8220;4R&#8221;) soft electronics enabled by LM composites. Gallium&#8208;based alloys and their eutectics, such as Galinstan and EGaIn, offer a rare convergence of high conductivity, fluidic deformability, and recyclability&#8212;ideally suited for stretchable circuits, soft robotics, and wearables. Yet, their promise remains incomplete without scalable, eco&#8208;friendly recovery methods. Advanced extraction and recycling approaches are examined, including mechanical&#8211;chemical and physicochemical methods using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and ionic liquids for selective recovery with minimal environmental impact. Emphasis is placed on materials selection, substrate compatibility, and integration strategies that enable circular lifecycles. LM composites offer a path to redefine electronics&#8212;not only for performance but also for durability, self&#8208;healing, and sustainability.

         <title>Comprehensive Understanding of Accelerated Kinetics Driven by Anion&#8211;Diluent Dynamics Enabling Wide Temp Operation in Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient interactions between TFSI&#8722; anions and a diluent within an anion&#8208;dictated electrolyte are revealed, which can reduce interfacial reorganization energy, thereby accelerating ion kinetics and markedly facilitating sustainable anion storage in high&#8208;voltage graphite cathodes for dual&#8208;ion batteries at fast charge and wide temperature range.








Abstract
Pioneering advancements in energy storage necessitate electrolyte innovations that enhance ion transport and reduce resistance. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing research predominantly explores cationic solvation structures, leaving the behavior of anions insufficiently addressed. Here, elucidate the previously ambiguous role of anion&#8211;diluent interactions by correlating solvation structures with kinetic behavior, thereby unveiling their mechanistic contribution from the bulk electrolyte environment to electrochemical reaction processes. Unlike traditional lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;centered studies in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs), this study provides an anion&#8208;centric perspective on solvation dynamics and demonstrates its efficacy in dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) systems, where both cations and anions participate in electrochemical redox processes. These transient anion&#8208;diluent interactions enhance&#160;anion mobility in the electrolyte, promote desolvation efficiency at interfaces, and reduce the reorganization energy. LHCE also prevents anion decomposition at high voltages, lowers interfacial resistance, and enhances structural stability by refining anion intercalation mechanisms in graphite. This study lays out a multiscale, comprehensive interpretation of how specific interactions influence electrode interfaces and electron transfer reactions, extending beyond the intrinsic properties of the electrolyte. These insights have the potential to revolutionize electrolyte design across various electrochemical systems, particularly energy storage technologies that require kinetic advancements.

         <title>A Lean&#8208;Water Hydrogel Electrolyte with Engineered Water&#8208;Lubricated Pathways Constructed by Unique Water&#8208;Inter&#8208;Micelle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure and tailored polymer network is prepared via a novel and facile method. Through the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic self&#8208;assembly of micelles, the limited water is distributed in the interstices between micelles, forming continuous water pathways for Zn2+ transport. Therefore, lean&#8208;water hydrogel achieves high ionic conductivity of 3.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at only 17.8 wt.% water.








Abstract
Hydrogel polymer electrolytes (HPEs) can mitigate leakage and suppress side reactions than liquid electrolytes in aqueous batteries. Nevertheless, their water content typically exceeds 80%, which perpetuates water&#8208;mediated side reactions. Characterized by a substantial reduction in water content, lean&#8208;water HPEs are designed. However, insufficient water severely impedes Zn2+ transport due to strong polymer&#8208;ion interactions. Herein, a lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with a unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure to overcome this dilemma via engineering water pathways is designed. Minimal water induces zinc dodecylbenzenesulfonate self&#8208;assembly into micelles, confining water within micellar interstices. This structure enables rapid Zn2+ migration along water&#8208;lubricated interstices, achieving 15.3 mS cm&#8722;1 conductivity at a water content of 20.6 wt.%. Subsequently, copolymerization of acrylamide (AM) and 4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) yielded a P(AM&#8208;ACMO) (PAC) lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte. Compared with conventional HPEs, densely packed micelles within PAC create ordered slit channels that establish continuous water pathways using only trace amounts of water. This maximizes water utilization, suppresses side reactions, and endows PAC with high ionic conductivity (3.2 mS cm&#8722;1) and Zn2+ transference number (0.88) at only 17.8 wt.% water content. In addition to high ionic conductivity and the ability to suppress dendrites, PAC also demonstrates exceptional adhesion and dehydration resistance, which contribute to its application in practical scenarios.

         <title>Regulating H&#8208;/J&#8208;Aggregation and Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling of Fused Ring Electron Acceptors Enable 20.51% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh, is developed to efficiently regulate molecular H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregation, suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforce intermolecular interaction, prolonging exciton lifetime and exciton diffusion length of the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieve the remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), among the highest values for OSCs so far.








Abstract
The limited exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic photovoltaic materials puts organic solar cells (OSCs) into a harsh position to compromise exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The exciton behavior of organic semiconductors is strongly related to the molecular alignment. Herein, an analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh with benzyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains is developed to blend with L8&#8208;BO and successfully regulate its molecular alignment. Incorporating L8&#8208;OPh into L8&#8208;BO enhances the H&#8208;aggregation tendency, weakens exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforces the intermolecular interaction of L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films. Such endows the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend film with improved exciton lifetime and larger exciton diffusion coefficient to prolong the LD up to 22.1&#160;nm, compared to L8&#8208;BO (16.5&#160;nm). Besides, L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films acquire increased crystallinity and better crystal quality to afford lower trap density, prolonged charge carrier lifetime and higher mobilities in D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary devices. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary OSCs achieve the remarkable PCE of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), which is among the highest PCEs in OSCs so far. It highlights the importance of finely regulating molecular alignment of organic photovoltaic materials to prolong the LD and boost PCEs of OSCs.

Pyro&#8208;Phototronic effect in centrosymmetric 2D RbPb2Cl5 nanocrystals have been observed as a function of halide deficiency. These have lead heptrahedra and prepared following a template approach of cation exchange. Using ligand chemistry, different morphologies of these nanocrystals are synthesized and their pyro&#8208;phototronic response recorded from visible to near IR spectral region.








Abstract
Cesium lead halide has been extensively studied as efficient materials for optoelectronic device applications. Beyond Cs(I), the exploration of other inorganic A&#8208;site monovalent cations remains limited, though Rb(I) stands out as a potential alternative whose role in colloidal nanocrystals is largely unexplored. Here, Rb (I) is employed as an effective A&#8208;site cation in forming monoclinic&#8208;phase RbPb2Cl5, where Pb (II) heptahedrally coordinated. A template&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy is employed where 0D Rb4CdCl6 used as host nanocrystals. Upon introduction of Pb (II), fast Cd to Pb ion exchange triggers and 2D RbPb2Cl5 in rhombic prism, hexagonal prism or hexagonal platelet&#8208;shaped nanocrystals are formed depending on the reaction conditions. Further to explore the optoelectronic properties, photo response measurements are carried out which exhibit significant pyro&#8208;photocurrent response from these nanocrystals even under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;intensity light illumination (7 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2) across ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Despite its centrosymmetric structure, RbPb2Cl5 generates pyro&#8208;photocurrent due to surface halide deficiencies, supported by DFT which shows surface polarization of |&#120665;P| = 0.173 C&#160;m&#8722;2. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Rb (I) in stabilizing these nanostructures and open a new avenue for their application in advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Recent Progress in Contact Force Sensing Techniques for Cardiovascular Interventional Procedures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in contact force sensing techniques for cardiovascular interventional surgery. The primary challenge is developing high&#8208;performance, miniaturized sensors that can be integrated into instruments like catheters, guidewires, and balloons for surgical guidance, diagnosis, and treatment. Innovations in sensing mechanisms, materials, and structures offer significant opportunities for advancing medical instruments.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as heart attacks and strokes, are the top causes of death and disability globally. The standard treatment for CVDs usually involves interventional procedures, in which slender instruments such as guidewires and catheters are navigated through blood vessels to reach target lesions. However, the inability to accurately quantify the contact force (CF) between interventional instruments and tissues raises the risks of vascular injury, poor ablation results, and high rates of recurrence after the procedure. With rapid advancements in robot&#8208;assisted interventional surgery, the need for accurate CF measurement and feedback has become increasingly urgent. This review systematically examines the latest research on CF sensing in interventional procedure, organized into four main areas: 1) a comparative analysis of CF sensing methods and their strengths and limitations; 2) an overview of functional materials for CF sensing and their properties; 3) a comparative evaluation of sensor designs regarding performance and constraints; and 4) a practical summary of CF sensing applications in guidewire navigation, occlusion penetration, catheter ablation, and related procedures. Finally, future directions for CF sensing, highlighting its critical role in advancing biomedical applications, are discussed.

         <title>Deciphering Defect&#8208;Mediated Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching Multimodal Luminescence for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the multicolor SrZnP2O7:Sm3+/Dy3+/Tb3+/Tm3+ phosphors exhibiting exceptional multimodal luminescence in the 350&#8211;750 nm range with anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties. A charge compensation strategy is established to enhance the quantum efficiency, photoluminescence/radioluminescence, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration by precise regulation of trap distribution and density. The developed phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescent materials displaying dynamically tunable multicolor emissions under diverse excitation channels are at the core of optical information encryption technologies. However, simultaneous achievement of high&#8208;performance multimodal luminescence with anti&#8208;thermal quenching (ATQ) feature remains a critical challenge. Herein, a new class of SrZnP2O7:RE (RE = Sm3+, Dy3+, Tb3+, Tm3+) phosphors is developed to fulfill these requirements through precise defect engineering. These phosphors exhibit photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence (RL), mechanoluminescence (ML), thermoluminescence (TL), and persistent luminescence (PersL) with emission spanning 350&#8211;750&#160;nm. By strategically incorporating charge compensators (Li+, Na+, K+), precise regulation of trap distribution and density is demonstrated, yielding remarkable enhancements in PL, quantum efficiency, RL intensity, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration. Crucially, the engineered deep traps in Sm/Dy/Tm&#8208;doped systems enable exceptional ATQ behavior. Comprehensive investigations reveal the critical role of charge compensation and defect redistribution in modulating luminescence performance. Benefiting from their superior multimodal emission properties, these phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications. This work establishes a new paradigm in luminescent material design, providing both fundamental insights into defect&#8208;luminescence property relationships and a practical framework for constructing advanced optical materials with tailored multimodal responses through precision trap state engineering.

         <title>Integrated TRNG and PUF Based on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymer Dielectric Gated Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed that incorporates a photoactivable RTP film as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, giving two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) and photocurrent (Id), enabling integrated true random number generator (TRNG) and physical unclonable function (PUF) functionalities.








Abstract
Harnessing the entropy of multiple transitions between different electronic states in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) not only overcomes the drawbacks of authentication via afterglow but also holds significant potential for cryptographic protocols that are immune to attacks from future quantum computers. However, such an objective has yet to be realized. Here, RTP films are incorporated as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, which give two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) from the dielectric layer and photocurrent (Id) across the source&#8208;drain electrode. The susceptible thermodynamics of electron transitions and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer at the dielectric&#8208;semiconductor interface causing Ip to vary with each readout, thereby enabling true random number generator (TRNG) functionality. Whereas Id is mainly governed by film quality and interfacial defects, which vary among different batches due to inherent randomness introduced during fabrication, making it suitable as a physical unclonable function (PUF). Detailed studies reveal that the two outputs demonstrate excellent uniqueness and independence, with a Hamming weight of 0.50, an inter&#8208;Hamming distance of 50.27%, a Pearson correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.0054, and an encoding capacity of 225 within a 5 &#215; 5 transistor array. This work represents a breakthrough of integrated optoelectronic devices for highly secure authentication while also inspiring new applications for RTP materials.

         <title>Highly Robust and Intrinsic Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphenylene Benzodiazole/Liquid Crystal Polyarylate Composites for Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interface molecular engineering design, intrinsically flame&#8208;retardant and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on polyphenylene benzodiazole fabric reinforced liquid crystal polyarylate (PBO/LCP) composites is achieved. The TENG is expected to provide a sustainable pathway for reliable energy sources and sensing for robots in extreme environments.








Abstract
Achieving a power supply for robots operating at high temperatures or in combustion environments is crucial for human life. As an emerging energy collection technique, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) possess great sustainability, however, their electrical output performances rapidly deteriorate due to the failure of polymer based triboelectric layers in harsh environments. Herein, an outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistant and electrically stable TENG is fabricated using composites of polyphenylene benzodiazole (PBO) fiber enhanced liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP). The intrinsic inert PBO fibers are modified by aminated naphthalimide sizing to effectively improve the interfacial interactions of PBO/LCP composites in terms of high tensile strength (409.3 MPa) and storage modulus at 250 &#176;C (0.18 GPa). More importantly, besides good flexibility, high heat resistance index of 303.9&#176;C, and impressive limiting oxygen index of 36.4%, the resultant TENGs showed enhanced electrical output performance at elevated temperature.

     alt="Highly Robust and Intrinsic Flame-Retardant Polyphenylene Benzodiazole/Liquid Crystal Polyarylate Composites for Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Harsh Environment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through interface molecular engineering design, intrinsically flame-retardant and high-temperature-resistant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on polyphenylene benzodiazole fabric reinforced liquid crystal polyarylate (PBO/LCP) composites is achieved. The TENG is expected to provide a sustainable pathway for reliable energy sources and sensing for robots in extreme environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving a power supply for robots operating at high temperatures or in combustion environments is crucial for human life. As an emerging energy collection technique, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) possess great sustainability, however, their electrical output performances rapidly deteriorate due to the failure of polymer based triboelectric layers in harsh environments. Herein, an outstanding high-temperature resistant and electrically stable TENG is fabricated using composites of polyphenylene benzodiazole (PBO) fiber enhanced liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP). The intrinsic inert PBO fibers are modified by aminated naphthalimide sizing to effectively improve the interfacial interactions of PBO/LCP composites in terms of high tensile strength (409.3 MPa) and storage modulus at 250 &#176;C (0.18 GPa). More importantly, besides good flexibility, high heat resistance index of 303.9&#176;C, and impressive limiting oxygen index of 36.4%, the resultant TENGs showed enhanced electrical output performance at elevated temperature. The output voltage reached 42 V at 200&#176;C, which could drive a louder buzzer compared to the reduced voltages (by 26.5%) at room temperature. Even after burning on the flame for 10 s, the output voltage is almost 100% retained. The findings demonstrate the great potential of interface molecular engineering and structure-function integrated composites for the wearable electronics of robots in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202504765), Lewis S. Jones, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers introduce the reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) for intraventricular myocardial repair. The multimaterial design integrates a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial with a hydrogel&#8208;filled melt&#8208;electrowritten mesh. In a large&#8208;animal model, the RCPatch sealed a myocardial defect, prevented bleeding, and restored hemodynamic stability, providing a surgically implantable and regenerative platform for cardiac repair.

Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials
Light harvesting in plants inspires researchers to develop nanomaterials mimicking this fascinating process. In the Review by Andrey S. Klymchenko, Deep Sekhar Biswas, and Pascal Didier (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202501237), light&#8208;harvesting nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, highlighting fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and exciton migration. Owing to efficient energy transfer from light&#8208;harvesting ensemble of dyes to a single acceptor, these materials enable signal amplification (antenna effect) important for (bio)sensing and molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Progress and Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysis of Liquid Formic Acid Dehydrogenation: Coordination Structure Design, Activity Improvement, and Mechanism Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation from perspectives of coordination structure design, catalytic performances, and reaction mechanisms. The design strategies, characterization technologies, activity evaluation and mechanism insights are presented in detail. These contents will provide a guidance for precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts to enhance catalytic performance towards FA decomposition.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has attracted significant interest as a renewable liquid&#8208;phase hydrogen carrier. Hydrogen generation from FA decomposition is essential for the development of hydrogen economy. Designing highly efficient catalysts with different coordination environments for FA dehydrogenation is crucial for fuel&#8208;cell applications. Here, FA dehydrogenation from the perspectives of coordination structure design, activity evaluation, and mechanisms is focused. In particular, the structural design of active sites and dominant factors that determine the catalytic activity/selectivity and reaction mechanism are highlighted. Strategies to design catalysts are proposed based on the aspects of electronic effects, component regulation and synergistic effects, interface effects, and reaction active site design to boost the catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, rate&#8208;determining step activity, and overall performance. Simultaneously, it is important to investigate the structure&#8211;activity relationship during hydrogen generation. In addition, the experimental protocol (hydrogen generation from FA or FA&#8208;SF, SF: sodium formate), calculation of reaction parameters, and determination of products during hydrogen generation are summarized. Finally, challenges, conclusions, and developments based on FA decomposition are presented. Here, guidance for the precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts is provided to enhance catalytic performance toward FA decomposition and satisfy the requirements for hydrogen generation in the future.

         <title>Interactions Between Active Matters and Endogenous Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes endogenous field information and computational methods in contexts such as cancer, wounds, and biofilms. It organizes NAMs and AAMs by sensing, transmitting, and executing functions, compares their limitations, and from these contrasts proposes design strategies for next&#8208;generation AAMs, offering perspectives to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and future research.








Abstract
Active matter, encompassing both natural and artificial systems, utilizes environmental energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors. Artificial active matter (AAM), such as nano/micromotors, holds transformative potential in precision medicine by enhancing drug delivery and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions. Under the demand for increasing intelligence in AAM, controlling their non&#8208;equilibrium processes within complex in vivo environments presents significant challenges. Endogenous fields&#8212;biological fields generated within living systems&#8212;play a pivotal role in guiding natural active matter's (NAM) directional migration and collective transformations, offering a strategy for in vivo control of non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Research in NAMs&#8208;inspired AAMs spans biology, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and physics, yet communication barriers among disciplines often impede progress. This review seeks to bridge these gaps by summarizing the key characteristics of chemical and physical endogenous fields in biological contexts such as tumors, wounds, and inflammation. It explores how natural and artificial active matter sense, transmit, and execute responses to these fields, and discusses how insights from natural systems can inform the design of synthetic counterparts. Potential issues and prospects of this research direction are also discussed. It is hoped that this review fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and propels the development of intelligent active matter for biomedical applications.

         <title>Toward Rational Electrocatalyst Design: Dynamic Insights from Liquid Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing efficient electrocatalysts relies on a deep understanding of electrocatalytic processes under realistic reaction conditions&#8212;an area that has long remained a &#8220;black box.&#8221; This review highlights how liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) addresses fundamental challenges in electrocatalytic research. By bridging &#8220;material and environmental gaps&#8221;, LETEM provides unprecedented insights into the underlying mechanism and dynamic structure&#8208;activity relationship for electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Electrocatalysis, a pivotal field at the intersection of physical chemistry and materials science, plays a crucial role in advancing energy conversion and storage technologies through rational catalyst design. However, understanding reaction mechanisms at the atomic level remains a great challenge due to the intricate interplay between catalysts, reactants, and complex environments (e.g., electric fields, liquid electrolytes). This complexity has led to persistent &#8220;material&#8221; and &#8220;environment&#8221; gaps between conventional electrocatalytic research and the practical behavior of catalysts under realistic operating conditions. The emergence of liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) enables the characterization of the electrocatalysts coupled with precise electrochemical measurements under operando conditions with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent breakthroughs in atomic&#8208;scale characterization of dynamic processes of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction environments have demonstrated the exceptional potential of LETEM for elucidating the nature of electrocatalysis and establishing robust atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity relationships. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress in the dynamic evolution of electrocatalysts via LETEM, with a particular focus on the structural evolution of electrocatalysts under electro&#8208;liquid coupled environments. This review is expected to provide insights for unlocking fundamental mechanisms and the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>From Carbon Nitrides to COFs: Opportunities and Prospects in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To underscore the potential of polymeric photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction&#8212;from carbon nitrides to covalent organic frameworks&#8212;the table of contents graphic presents recent breakthroughs in the design of light&#8208;responsive organic photocatalysts. These include strategies such as junction engineering, non&#8208;metallic site tuning, enhancement of crystallinity, metal incorporation, structural modulation, and optimization of molecular linkages.








Abstract
The continuing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas and accelerating climate change are driving demand for innovative mitigation strategies. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR) presents a promising and sustainable route to convert CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and fuels utilizing sunlight, thereby mitigating CO2 emissions. This review examines the developmental aspects of light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion using organic polymeric photocatalysts, focusing on carbon nitrides (CNs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials are verified to possess great potential for PCO2RR, because they offer tunable band gaps, large surface areas, efficient light absorption, and remarkable activity and selectivity in photocatalysis. In this review, the comprehensive analysis of photocatalytic materials (e.g., CNs, CTFs, and COFs) are thoroughly discussed, along with their mechanisms, historical advancements, and urgent roles in PCO2RR. Strategies for enhancing the CO2 photoreduction efficiency of CNs, CTFs, and COFs are also highlighted. Each organic material brings distinct advantages. The review also addresses critical challenges, such as improving efficiency and managing charge transport dynamics for PCO2RR. Finally, the review underscores the need to develop scalable CO2 conversion applications, advance organic photocatalyst material science, and support sustainable energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Autonomous Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal implant should mimic native tissues such that it can integrate, sense, heal, and continue to function, i.e., be autonomous. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, and self&#8208;aware implants. This forward&#8208;looking review outlines the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into a multifunctional implant in the future.








Abstract
With the increasing aging population, more implants are being used in the body. However, these implants often fail, and they suffer from a lack of integration or proper function. Efforts have been made to generate implants by employing bioactive materials, adding cellular components, and integrating smart characteristics such as self&#8208;healing properties. The vision is, however, to develop an implant that can mimic native tissues in their way of doing things, responding to challenges and remodeling. Such automated implants require the integration of advances made in various fields of science. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, self&#8208;aware implants. Attempts to combine more than one smart property into these implants are still at the beginning, e.g., the integration of such special characteristics requires a new set of skills and thinking, which presents new challenges that warrant exploration and investment. Such an implant evolution is expected to be in stages, where the first implant will be able to communicate with doctors and hospitals; then, in the next stage, with patients, and later, they will be independent, sense any disturbances and aberrations from normal early on, and correct themselves before damage becomes irreversible. This forward&#8208;looking review looks at the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into multifunctional implants in the future. The stages of material, in vitro, and in vivo testing and clinical application, if any, are critically reviewed. In addition, the challenges facing the development of autonomous smart implants are discussed, and research directions and ideas are suggested.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Based Oxygen Electrocatalysts: Mechanistic Insights, Property Tuning Strategies, and Prospects toward Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, emphasizing intrinsic properties, general principles for modulation strategies, and mechanistic understanding by in situ characterizations. 








Abstract
MXene delivers promising features that are highly compatible with oxygen electrocatalysis, such as excellent electroconductivity, high specific surface area, superhydrophilicity, and tailorable chemically functionalized surfaces, thus being recognized as the ideal platform for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for practical applications in industrial devices. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen catalytic mechanism on MXene ontology and a systematic refining of the general principles toward various physicochemical property regulation strategies are, respectively, the basis and effective alleyway to hitting the target, yet it is currently insufficient and need to be further explored in&#8208;depth. Herein, the fundamental effects of MXene on oxygen catalytic activity are sorted out thoroughly, and on this basis, the current mainstream strategies for tuning the property of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are classified into four categories, including anion&#8208;tuning, cation&#8208;tuning, defect/vacancy regulation, and heterometallic dual&#8208;site collaboration, where the intrinsic mechanism of each strategy affecting the structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is revealed accordingly. Particularly, the indispensability of advanced in situ characterizations in establishing the dynamic process of oxygen electrocatalysis, including real&#8208;time structural evolution and reaction pathways is emphasized. Finally, the latest advances of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are reviewed from the viewpoint of the metal&#8211;support interactions effect, along with forward&#8208;looking perspectives on addressing the present thorny challenges.

     alt="MXene-Based Oxygen Electrocatalysts: Mechanistic Insights, Property Tuning Strategies, and Prospects toward Practical Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights MXene-based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, emphasizing intrinsic properties, general principles for modulation strategies, and mechanistic understanding by in situ characterizations. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MXene delivers promising features that are highly compatible with oxygen electrocatalysis, such as excellent electroconductivity, high specific surface area, superhydrophilicity, and tailorable chemically functionalized surfaces, thus being recognized as the ideal platform for developing high-performance catalysts for practical applications in industrial devices. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen catalytic mechanism on MXene ontology and a systematic refining of the general principles toward various physicochemical property regulation strategies are, respectively, the basis and effective alleyway to hitting the target, yet it is currently insufficient and need to be further explored in-depth. Herein, the fundamental effects of MXene on oxygen catalytic activity are sorted out thoroughly, and on this basis, the current mainstream strategies for tuning the property of MXene-based electrocatalysts are classified into four categories, including anion-tuning, cation-tuning, defect/vacancy regulation, and heterometallic dual-site collaboration, where the intrinsic mechanism of each strategy affecting the structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is revealed accordingly. Particularly, the indispensability of advanced in situ characterizations in establishing the dynamic process of oxygen electrocatalysis, including real-time structural evolution and reaction pathways is emphasized. Finally, the latest advances of MXene-based electrocatalysts are reviewed from the viewpoint of the metal&#8211;support interactions effect, along with forward-looking perspectives on addressing the present thorny challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials Based on Dyes for Energy Transfer and Amplified Biosensing</title>

Light harvesting (LH) in plants inspires researchers to develop artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, considering fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, excitation energy transfer, and exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to signal amplification (antenna effect) important for sensing.








Abstract
Fascinating process of light harvesting (LH) in plants and bacteria leads to photosynthesis of oxygen and organic matter on the planet. It inspires researchers in the last decades to develop synthetic analogues &#8211; artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on dyes (organic chromophores) are reviewed. The fundamental aspects of LH include dye assembly into materials with minimal energy losses (i.e., high fluorescence quantum yield with minimized aggregation&#8208;caused quenching) and fast excitation energy transfer with large exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to an amplification of acceptor emission &#8211; antenna effect, which constitutes the key performance parameter of LH nanoantenna. Individual classes of dye&#8208;based LH nanomaterials are analyzed: covalent molecular arrays of dyes (e.g., dendrimers and macrocycles), aggregates of &#8220;classical&#8221; dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission nanomaterials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, ion&#8208;associated nanomaterials, and hybrid dye&#8208;based organic systems, such as dye&#8208;biomolecule hybrids, micelles and supramolecular polymers, dye&#8208;loaded silica and polymeric nanoparticles. The design principles and key performance characteristics of their selected (non&#8208;exhaustive) examples are analyzed. Due to their capacity to amplify the acceptor fluorescence signal, LH nanomaterials are particularly suitable for amplified sensing of small molecules, ions, biomolecules, which is particularly attractive for biomedical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Emission From Single Chiral Hedgehog Particles Coated with Nanofilms of Achiral Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) is observed from chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) coated with a nanofilm of achiral perovskite, with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskites and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Careful analysis of optical activity indicates that the CPLE of perovskite luminescence is dominated by post&#8208;emission scattering from the chiral surfaces of the same CHIPs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are known for their strong and tunable luminescence. However, the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;based particles with circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) remains challenging due to the complex interplay of metal&#8208;ligand chemistries, crystallization patterns, and chirality transfer mechanisms. Achiral perovskites can be deposited on chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) with twisted spikes, producing chiroptically active materials with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskite and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed CPLE is engineered into complex particles comprised of a layer of perovskite deposited onto CHIPs coated with an intermediate silica layer. The spectral position of chiroptical bands, the optical asymmetry g&#8208;factors, and single&#8208;particle circularly polarized microscopy indicate that the observed CPLE is dominated by the post&#8208;emission scattering from the twisted spikes of the parent particle. Templating luminescent nanofilms on CHIPs provides a simple pathway to a wide range of complex chiroptical materials; the dispersibility of the CHIPs in various solvents and the tunability of their chiral geometry enable their applications as single&#8208;particle emitters with strong and controllable polarization rotation.

         <title>Direct Imaging of Hydrogen&#8208;Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, 3D nanoscale strain maps of a stainless steel grain were&#160;measured during hydrogen charging. Results show dislocation relaxation and climb, elucidating the role of point defects in hydrogen&#8208;modified deformation behavior. Detailed strain measurements reveal shielding of dislocation strain fields. These experimental results validate theoretical predictions and provide new insights into embrittlement mechanisms.








Abstract
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron&#8208;transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen&#8208;induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging to track three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen&#8208;enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen&#8208;induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen&#8208;driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE&#8208;resistant&#160;alloys.

         <title>Role of Amorphous Phases in Mixed Conduction of Conjugated Regioblock Copolymers for Organic Electrochemical Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical roles of amorphous and crystalline phases in polymer&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors for organic electrochemical synaptic transistors using conjugated regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom copolymers are demonstrated. Amorphous phases contribute to gradual polaron formation and strong ion trapping by bipolarons, leading to improved synaptic state modulation. The synaptic transistors with appropriate amorphous content exhibited low power consumption in the neuromorphic learning process.








Abstract
Growing interest in organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OECT&#8208;STrs) based on conjugated polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (CP&#8208;MIECs) has intensified, leading to the need to establish clear design rules and fundamentally understand the distinct roles of crystalline and amorphous domains in the electrochemical doping behavior of CP&#8208;MIEC films. Here, OECT&#8208;STrs based on regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom (regioblock) conjugated copolymers with precisely controlled crystallinity are demonstrated. The crystallinity of a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) regioblock copolymer is systematically tuned by varying the fraction of regiorandom blocks without altering the geometry or orientation of the crystalline phase. It is shown that incorporating an amorphous phase into the active channel of OECT&#8208;STrs significantly enhances the neuromorphic learning efficiency by improving modulation uniformity. This improvement results from sequential polaron formation in the amorphous regions and bipolaron formation in the crystalline domains during potentiation. Additionally, crystalline phases provide better state retention at low potentiation states, while amorphous phases contribute to improved long&#8208;term retention at high potentiation states by enhancing charge carrier localization through stronger Coulombic interactions. Neural network simulations based on actual device conductance demonstrate that OECT&#8208;STrs with a high amorphous fraction consume only 18% of the power required by devices with a highly crystalline film, owing to the need for fewer repetitive learning cycles.

Inspired by the eel's electric organ, a miniature implantable biohybrid device is developed to generate electricity under light activation. The device utilizes a light&#8208;dependent ion gradient formation that induced by genetically engineered human designer cells that express light&#8208;sensitive membrane ion channels and proton pumps, working in synergy with the device to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy.








Abstract
Herein, an implantable, miniature biohybrid device has been developed that utilizes light&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;gradient formation by genetically engineered human designer cells, expressing light&#8208;activated ion channels and proton pumps to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy. These designer cells are cultured in custom&#8208;designed polycarbonate chambers, connected by electrodes and separated from an ion reservoir by a proton&#8208;selective Nafion membrane. Upon illumination, the light&#8208;activated channels and pumps on the designer cells establish a sustained proton gradient across the Nafion membrane, which drives an electrical current in the external circuit. When exposed to simulated ambient sunlight of 3&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of intensity, a single solar collection device (SCD), containing these designer cells, appropriately sized for subcutaneous implantation in mice, generates an electrical potential of &#8776;0.4&#160;V. By connecting multiple SCDs in series and increasing the cell suspension volume, the output can be scaled up sufficiently to power a commercial light&#8208;emitting diode. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a photovoltaic system based on optogenetically engineered mammalian cells for powering bioelectronic implants or wearable devices.

         <title>Anomalous Reconfigurable&#8208;Transport in MoS2 Transistors by Electrically&#8208;Switchable van der Waals Interfacial Dipole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a tunable insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of BiOCl and MoS2, where interfacial charge transfer forms a strong dipole. By switching the dipole polarity with an electric field, reconfigurable transport characteristics are achieved in MoS2 transistors, including n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped behaviors. A dual&#8208;gate configuration enables multi&#8208;state switching, offering potential for negative differential resistance and scalable 2D transistor applications.








Abstract
Interfacial charge transfer leads to the formation of an electric dipole at the interface of a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. The switching of dipole polarity using an electric field provides an effective method for modulating the electronic properties of vdW systems. However, the experimental observation of switched vdW dipoles is challenging, as it is concealed by the electrostatic gating effect. In this work, the significant electrical tunability of the strong interfacial dipole formed in an insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of high&#8208;work&#8208;function BiOCl and MoS2 are demonstrated. The heterostructured device essentially operates as a planar tunneling transistor, where band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling occurs within the vdW doping&#8208;defined junction, resulting in a subthreshold swing significantly lower than that of typical field effect transistors. More importantly, the anomalous reconfiguration of electronic transports is observed in MoS2 transistors due to the switching of vdW dipole and its competition with the electrostatic gating. By varying the BiOCl thickness, the n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped transfer characteristics are achieved. Furthermore, a dual&#8208;gate configuration further enhances functionality of the device, enabling multi&#8208;state switching, which is of particularly interest for these applications requiring negative differential resistance. This work offers a scalable, versatile, and non&#8208;destructive strategy for tuning reconfigurable two&#8208;dimensional&#160;transistors.

Epigenetic nanoagonist for multilevel T cell activation. a) DPM@iCARM1@siPVR assembly. b) Actions of the nanoagonist against PD&#8208;L1 &#8208; resistant tumors: 1) iCARM1 released in tumor cells activates cGAS&#8208;STING signaling for dendritic cell maturation, aiding T cell priming; 2) In T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXCR3; 3) SiPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells.








Abstract
Inefficient priming, poor recruitment, and inadequate reinvigoration of T cells challenges the therapy of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors. Herein, a pH&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanoplatform integrating coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibitor (iCARM1) and poliovirus receptor siRNA (siPVR) is developed. Upon tumor penetration, iCARM1 released in tumor cells facilitates T cell priming by epigenetically activating cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling&#8208;mediated dendritic cell maturation. Meanwhile, in T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXC&#8208;chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. The released siPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells. This epigenetic nanoagonist induces a robust immune response, dramatically suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse, and confers durable protection against secondary tumor challenge. Multiple PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant models demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy. This study thus represents an innovative approach for facilitating multilevel T cell responses to combat PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>Interlayer Switching of NiO6 Octahedra Tilt via Interstitial Oxygen in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1, 2, 3)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research presents an anti&#8208;parallel interlayer tilt coupling of NiO6 octahedra induced by interstitial oxygen in high&#8208;pressure oxygen annealing Lan + 1NinO3n + 1(n = 1,2, 3). The new coupling pattern brings new symmetry along the caxis, alters the electronic structure, and hinders the superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, directing a micro&#8208;structural route to investigate and tune the novel functionalities in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite nickelates.








Abstract
Oxygen octahedra tilt, an important knob to tune properties of perovskite oxides and their derivatives, determines the coupling patterns and emergent states. Conventional methods, such as strain and doping, are primarily employed to modulate the magnitude of the octahedra tilt. The switching of the tilt, however, is challenging due to the intrinsic interlocked coupling. Here, we achieve the interlayer switching of NiO6 octahedral tilting via interstitial oxygen insertion in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 2). Interstitial oxygen with an alternative occupation in the rock&#8208;salt (LaO) layers induces completely opposite tilt patterns of NiO6 octahedra in neighboring perovskite (LaNiO3) layers. EELS reveals a lower unoccupied UHB and a spectral&#8208;weight transfer, which may contribute to the suppression of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 as confirmed by our high&#8208;pressure transport experiments. This mechanism of NiO6 octahedral tilt switching is further validated in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1 and 3), offering a promising strategy for regulating the properties of layered perovskite oxides.

Inspired by Breviceps adspersus epidermis in nature, a novel piezoelectric stress buffer layer is introduced to address challenges faced by SiOx electrodes. This innovative design significantly mitigates excessive volume expansion and stabilizes solid electrolyte interface of SiOx electrodes, yielding remarkable improvements in battery cycling and rate performance. These advances open pathways for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium battery applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity silicon suboxide (SiOx, 0 &lt; x &lt; 2) anodes have long faced the problems of huge volume expansion, fast capacity decay and unsatisfied rate performance. To overcome these bottlenecks, the volume expansion resistance and electrogenic Na+ transport functions of common rain frog (Breviceps adspersus) epidermis are introduced into the design philosophy of stress buffers for SiOx electrodes. Thereupon, a mechanically robust, piezoelectric (MP) stress buffer layer comprised of ferroelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles and a novel homopolymer (PCM) binder of cyanoethyl carbamate&#8208;containing methacrylate is developed. It is demonstrated that MP stress buffer layer with superior mechanical properties effectively inhibits excessive volume expansion and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interface along with much suppressed electrolyte decomposition. Meanwhile, MP stress buffer layer helps expedite the dealloying reaction kinetics of SiOx electrodes in half&#8208;cells, mainly owing to the generation of a stress&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field within MP stress buffer layer, conducive to improving battery rate performance. As a result, unprecedented cycling and rate performance can be realized in coin and home&#8208;made soft package cells with SiOx and SiOx/graphite composite electrodes. Such a design philosophy of stress buffer layers marks an important milestone in developing high&#8208;energy lithium batteries with SiOx&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Decoupling Transport of Salt Ions and Water in Hierarchically Structured Hydrogel for High Salinity Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured hydrogel evaporator enables controlled decoupling of salt&#8208;ion and water transport pathways for efficient solar desalination in hypersaline environments. Engineered radial and vertical channels direct salt away from the evaporative interface, enhancing water evaporation and ambient energy harvesting via a cold&#8208;surface effect. This integrated design supports a scalable zero&#8208;liquid&#8208;discharge desalination platform.








Abstract
Global water scarcity demands next&#8208;generation desalination technologies that transcend the limitations of energy&#8208;intensive processes and salt accumulation. Herein, a groundbreaking interfacial solar steam generation system capable of simultaneous hypersaline desalination and ambient energy harvesting is introduced. Through hierarchical hydrogel architecture incorporating a central vertical channel and radial channels with gradient apertures, the design effectively decouples salt transport and water evaporation: solar&#8208;driven fluid convection directs water outward for evaporation, while inward salt migration prevents surface crystallization and redistributes excess heat. The heat dissipation induces a sub&#8208;ambient &#8220;cold evaporation&#8221; effect, lowering the evaporative interface temperature and enhancing ambient energy utilization. The system achieves a remarkable water evaporation rate exceeding 12&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in a 20 wt% hypersaline environment and operates continuously for 15 h without salt accumulation. Outdoor testing demonstrates a daily water production of 67.2 L m&#8722;2, with scalable potential for sustainable desalination and industrial brine treatment.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Compact Topological Photonic Crystal Rainbow Nanolasers Operating in the 1550 nm Telecom Band with Wavelength&#8208;Scale Mode Volumes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale rainbow light trapping for lasing emission in the 1550 nm telecom band is experimentally demonstrated. Ultra&#8208;compact 1D and 2D topological rainbow nanolasers are presented, featuring ultra&#8208;small mode volumes, ultra&#8208;low lasing thresholds, and remarkable robustness against fabrication imperfections and defects.








Abstract
Topological rainbow trapping, spatially separating and confining multiple topologically protected light frequencies, offers a prospective scheme for achieving robust multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single nanodevice. Here, ultra&#8208;compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers&#160;operating in the 1550 nm telecom band are experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, rainbow&#8208;like single&#8208;mode emission with a controllable free spectral range and a wavelength&#8208;scale mode volume is presented in a one&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust rainbow spectral emission across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, an ultra&#8208;compact two&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser is demonstrated in an exceptionally small footprint, featuring a broad rainbow spectrum with 64 continuously tuned single&#8208;mode lasing peaks. This work provides a promising approach for realizing robust and nanoscale multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single device, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact high&#8208;throughput data processing systems, including on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division&#8208;multiplexing and optical&#160;interconnects.

         <title>All&#8208;3D&#8208;Printed Multi&#8208;Environment Modular Microrobots Powered by Large&#8208;Displacement Dielectric Elastomer Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are demonstrated. The key breakthrough lies in the development of a large&#8208;displacement microactuator for multi&#8208;environment navigation and a mesoscale multimaterial 3D printing platform for on&#8208;demand module fabrication. Together, these innovations advance the adaptability, versatility, and scalability of microrobotic systems.








Abstract
Microrobots are expected to push the boundaries of robotics by enabling navigation in confined and cluttered environments due to their sub&#8208;centimeter scale. However, most microrobots perform best only in the specific conditions for which they are designed and require complete redesign and fabrication to adapt to new tasks and environments. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are introduced. For multi&#8208;environment navigation, large&#8208;displacement dielectric elastomer microactuators with a soft&#8208;stiff hybrid structure are developed, capable of powering microrobots to stride over obstacles on various terrestrial terrain and rapidly propel themselves across aquatic terrain. To further expand their capabilities beyond mere navigation, ten task&#8208;specific modules for the microrobots are developed. All modules are fabricated using a digital light processing multimaterial 3D printer capable of simultaneously printing multiple photocurable resins, providing a broadly applicable platform for fabricating mesoscale robotic components. The microrobots navigate across smooth, rough, granular, and aquatic environments, demonstrating tasks such as controlling the movements of nearby robots, interacting with humans to avoid collisions, and collaboratively dragging heavy objects through multi&#8208;unit operation. The study addresses key limitations hindering the integration of modular design into microrobots, enabling adaptation to new environments and tasks.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar Upcycling of Nitrate and Glycerol with Highly Efficient and Durable Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system integrating bi&#8208;functional nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) catalysts with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based dual photoelectrodes is reported. The system enables simultaneous solar&#8208;driven conversion of nitrate to ammonia and glycerol to formic acid with high efficiency and stability. This work demonstrates one of the highest&#8208;performing OS&#8208;based bias&#8208;free PEC systems reported to date.








Abstract
The sustainable management of biodiesel byproducts, nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and glycerol, remains a critical environmental challenge, disrupting global nitrogen and carbon cycles. Addressing this issue from a materials science perspective, a bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system based on the integration of functional energy materials is presented. A nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic bi&#8208;functional activity for selective NO3&#8722; reduction and glycerol oxidation, driven by the redox dynamics of Ni and Fe and electronic modulation by phosphorus incorporation. Through a metal&#8208;foil encapsulation strategy, the catalyst is integrated with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based photoanodes and photocathodes, forming a highly efficient OS&#8208;based PEC system capable of stable operation under continuous solar illumination. The individual photoelectrodes demonstrate photocurrent densities of +15.7 and&#8722;14.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under AM 1.5G conditions, while exhibiting remarkable stability with over 96% of initial performance retained after 60 h. To enable bias&#8208;free solar upcycling, a dual&#8208;photoelectrode PEC configuration is constructed, delivering a high reaction current of 11.04&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 along with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiencies and excellent selectivity for both ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (FA) production. This work underscores the potential of materials&#8208;driven PEC platforms for selective solar chemical upcycling.

&lt;p&gt;A bias-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system integrating bi-functional nickel-iron-phosphorus (Ni-Fe-P) catalysts with organic semiconductor (OS)-based dual photoelectrodes is reported. The system enables simultaneous solar-driven conversion of nitrate to ammonia and glycerol to formic acid with high efficiency and stability. This work demonstrates one of the highest-performing OS-based bias-free PEC systems reported to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sustainable management of biodiesel byproducts, nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and glycerol, remains a critical environmental challenge, disrupting global nitrogen and carbon cycles. Addressing this issue from a materials science perspective, a bias-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system based on the integration of functional energy materials is presented. A nickel-iron-phosphorus (Ni-Fe-P) electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic bi-functional activity for selective NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and glycerol oxidation, driven by the redox dynamics of Ni and Fe and electronic modulation by phosphorus incorporation. Through a metal-foil encapsulation strategy, the catalyst is integrated with organic semiconductor (OS)-based photoanodes and photocathodes, forming a highly efficient OS-based PEC system capable of stable operation under continuous solar illumination. The individual photoelectrodes demonstrate photocurrent densities of +15.7 and&#8722;14.8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under AM 1.5G conditions, while exhibiting remarkable stability with over 96% of initial performance retained after 60 h. To enable bias-free solar upcycling, a dual-photoelectrode PEC configuration is constructed, delivering a high reaction current of 11.04&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; along with &amp;gt;95% Faradaic efficiencies and excellent selectivity for both ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and formic acid (FA) production. This work underscores the potential of materials-driven PEC platforms for selective solar chemical upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upgrading Natural Ores for Efficient Photothermal Polyester Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a solar&#8208;driven plastic upcycling system using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals as photothermal catalysts. It overcomes key industrial challenges by utilizing abundant, low&#8208;cost minerals to achieve high&#8208;efficiency polyester waste conversion into valuable monomers. This innovation enables scalable, sustainable plastic valorization, accelerating the transition toward circular economies.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical upcycling of polyester waste into monomers represents a critical pathway to mitigate the global environmental crisis posed by plastic pollution. However, reconciling atomic&#8208;scale catalyst design with industrial manufacturing demands remains a fundamental challenge for addressing the &gt;80 million tons of polyester waste generated annually. Here, a solar&#8208;driven glycolysis platform is reported using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals (FeS2) as photothermal catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts requiring complex synthesis, this mineral&#8208;derived system leverages low&#8208;cost, abundant raw materials, a green synthesis process, and easy scale&#8208;up. The activated pyrite exhibits a monomer yield 51.2&#8208;fold higher than pristine pyrite. Structural and mechanistic studies reveal that thermal activation generates iron&#8208;sulfur cooperative sites via topological transformation, which synergistically enhance the adsorption of polyester and ethylene glycol, boosting the subsequent nucleophilic substitution depolymerization reaction. The findings may catalyze innovations in polymer regeneration technologies and establish scalable pathways for plastic waste valorization, accelerating global transition to circular economies.

Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on rGO (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed as a novel separator modifier for Li&#8208;S battery. Fe&#8208;doping induces OVs with Lewis acidity, which causes sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption regulated by the Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. The optimized electronic structure and enhanced electronic conductivity promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate fast conversion of the blocked LiPSs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been hindered by the low active material utilization, sluggish kinetics and Li anode corrosion caused by the dissolution of Li polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates. To solve these problems simultaneously, Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed via dopant selection and doping content optimization as a novel separator modifier. Tunable Fe&#8208;doping induces the controllable generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs), endowing rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe with suitable Lewis acid character, which causes a sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption between OVs and various LiPSs. All the long&#8208;chain LiPSs are blocked, while partial Li2S4 passes over the separator to react with the Li anode for forming robust SEI, which could ease the Li corrosion from LiPSs and suppress Li dendrite. Furthermore, the optimized electronic structure and the enhanced electronic conductivity from Fe&#8208;doping promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate the conversion of the blocked LiPSs. Consequently, with the synergistic effect between sieving effect and enhanced catalysis, rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe modified separator provides Li&#8208;S battery remarkable cycling (fading rate: 0.035%@5 C during 1000 cycles), power, and shelving performances. This strategy, based on rational dopant selection and OVs regulation, offers a universal separator design for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries toward industrialization.

         <title>Copper Catalysts Inherit and Retain Precatalyst Morphology in Extended CO Electroreduction to n&#8208;Propanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating enables the formation of quenched Cu oxide precatalysts with intragrain&#8208;in&#8208;grain architectures. These hierarchical structures are inherited after electroreduction, suppressing reconstruction even at high current densities in an MEA cell. The high intragrain boundary density enhances CO adsorption and C1&#8211;C2 coupling, leading to selective n&#8208;propanol formation &#8776;35%. This approach achieves both structural durability and improved C3 selectivity.








Abstract
Copper catalyst morphology, faceting, and oxidation state are each known to impact selectivity in the electroreduction of CO. Copper oxide precatalysts are synthesized using flash Joule heating and rapid cooling, and it is observed that temperature ramp rates can be used to control morphology, enabling us to implement &#8776;10&#160;nm&#8208;sized intragrain features within &#8776;35 nm grains. It is found that the structural features of the precatalysts are substantially transferred to Cu catalysts that are formed when they are employed in CO electroreduction in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The catalysts achieve &#8776;35% faradaic efficiency to n&#8208;propanol, among the highest selectivities to C3 from monometallic Cu. Both selectivity and morphology are retained following 330 h of operation at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. CO dilution studies reveal that catalysts with similar faceting, but smaller grain sizes, exhibit n&#8208;propanol selectivity that increases with CO concentration, suggesting that grain interfaces contribute to CO coverage and C1&#8211;C2 coupling. Complementary operando Raman spectroscopy shows that reducing grain size enables higher CO coverage, suggesting that structural features enhancing linear CO adsorption are correlated with improved selectivity to C3.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Switching in Wurtzite/Fluorite Bilayers for High&#8208;Performance Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximity&#8208;induced switching in AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers enables a novel combination of low remanent polarization and high coercive field. A ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor incorporating an AlN/HfZrO2 gate stack yields a wide memory window, superior retention, and endurance characteristics. This work pioneers a new strategy for engineering ferroelectric response through integrating distinct ferroelectric materials.








Abstract
Proximity ferroelectricity, wherein polarization switching in one ferroelectric layer with a lower energy barrier can trigger switching in an adjacent ferroelectric with a higher energy barrier, has been demonstrated only in bilayers composed of structurally similar wurtzite&#8208;structured materials. This work demonstrates proximity&#8208;induced ferroelectric switching across a heterostructure composed of crystallographically and functionally dissimilar materials, wurtzite&#8208;structured AlScN and fluorite&#8208;structured HfZrO2. The AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers exhibit cooperative switching dynamics despite their contrasting symmetry and polarization behaviors. This interfacial coupling produces a unique ferroelectric response, characterized by low remanent polarization and a high coercive field. Using the AlN/HfZrO2 bilayer, a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated on a p&#8208;type Si substrate with phosphorus&#8208;doped source and drain regions. The device shows a wide memory window with excellent retention and endurance. These results establish a versatile materials design strategy for engineering ferroelectricity via structural and functional heterogeneity.

This work demonstrates proximity-induced ferroelectric switching across a heterostructure composed of crystallographically and functionally dissimilar materials, wurtzite-structured AlScN and fluorite-structured HfZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The AlScN/HfZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AlN/HfZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bilayers exhibit cooperative switching dynamics despite their contrasting symmetry and polarization behaviors. This interfacial coupling produces a unique ferroelectric response, characterized by low remanent polarization and a high coercive field. Using the AlN/HfZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bilayer, a ferroelectric field-effect transistor is fabricated on a p-type Si substrate with phosphorus-doped source and drain regions. The device shows a wide memory window with excellent retention and endurance. These results establish a versatile materials design strategy for engineering ferroelectricity via structural and functional heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upcycling PET Coupled with Energy&#8208;Saving H2 Production from Seawater at Asymmetric Active Center</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of selectively oxidizing a single hydroxymethyl group while preserving the C&#9472;C bond during ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation (EGOR). By integrating oxyphilic transition metals with noble metals, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O electrocatalyst featuring asymmetric active centers is designed to induce dynamic electron delocalization. This breaks EG molecular symmetry, enabling directed adsorption of key intermediates (*OCCH2OH and *OH), oriented deprotonation of hydroxymethyl, and timely desorption of C2 products.








Abstract
Electrochemically upcycling polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into high&#8208;value glycolic acid (GA) with H2 production elegantly addresses the dual challenges of clean energy production and plastic recycling. Herein, an electrocatalyst of Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O is reported, where the Co&#9472;O&#9472;Ru asymmetric active center triggers the dynamic electronic delocalization is constructed. Such innovative design facilitates the designated bonding of key intermediates for *OCCH2OH and *OH at the Ru and Co sites during EG oxidation reactions (EGOR), respectively, while maintaining the integrity of C&#9472;C bond. As a result, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O demonstrates remarkable performance for EGOR, requiring only 0.68 V@RHE to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reducing energy consumption by 60.1% compared to the traditional oxygen evolution. Notably, under industrial conditions (1.0 V@RHE, &#8776;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it still maintains a Faraday efficiency of 96.6% and a selectivity of 93.5% for GA, breaking through the performance bottleneck of existing catalytic systems. Implemented at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, this system converts PET hydrolysate into GA (0.0299&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1) and produces H2 (1.531 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) from natural seawater simultaneously, with exceptional stability of &lt;12% decay after 120&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes an innovative paradigm for synergistic plastic upcycling and green hydrogen production.

         <title>Atomical&#8208;Rippled&#8208;Nanodomains Stabilized Large Polarization in BiSmCo2O6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics.








Abstract
Double&#8208;perovskite ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention due to their highly tunable structures, multifunctional coupling effects, and potential applications in next&#8208;generation nonvolatile ferroelectric semiconductor devices. Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains (ARNs) are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization (&#8776;23.1 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2) and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue resistance exceeding 1012 cycles without degradation. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching dynamics reveal the intrinsic correlation between the continuous switchable ARNs and the outstanding ferroelectric behavior. These findings underscore the effectiveness of nanodomain&#8208;coupling strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics and offer a promising pathway toward designing correlated oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric semiconductor devices with exotic functionalities.

         <title>Converting Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode into Non&#8208;Shrinking Sacrificial Prelithiation Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into a lithium&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt (LRDO) prelithiation agent by structural reconstruction. The voltage&#8208;compatible characteristics and phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during lithium compensation enable its function as a non&#8208;volumetric&#8208;shrinkage sacrificial agent, which eliminates cathode architecture failure and interfacial degradation induced by conventional prelithiation processes, thereby enhancing practical lithium&#8208;ion battery energy density.








Abstract
To improve the energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries, conventional sacrificial prelithiation agents (Li5FeO4, Li2O and Li2CO3, etc.) are introduced to compensate for active lithium loss, but they undergo serious volumetric shrinkage during decomposition, generating voids that compromise electrode architecture integrity and deteriorate electrochemical performance. Herein, the typical Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt oxide (LRDO) prelithiation agent, achieving 330 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 charge capacity and retaining 130 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity (contributing 200 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 irreversible prelithiation capacity). Compared with the layered structure, the cation&#8208;disordered structure in LRDO tunes the local oxygen environment, completely activating oxygen&#8208;related anionic oxidation activity at lower potential (&lt;4.5&#160;V). Moreover, coupled with a fluorinated electrolyte additive, the nucleophilic oxygen species released during de&#8208;lithiation of LRDO are synergistically utilized, constructing a gradient cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture with enhanced interfacial stability during the cell formation process. Most importantly, the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during prelithiation completely eradicates volume shrinkage, effectively preventing electrode architecture degradation. Furthermore, a long&#8208;life graphite||LiFePO4 pouch cell with high discharge capacity of 150.02 mAh (7.59% higher than without prelithiation) are achieved, maintaining 91.33% capacity after 1800 cycles.

         <title>Delineating the Triphasic Side Reaction Products in High&#8208;Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphasic side reaction products&#8212;gaseous, soluble, and solid CEI&#8212;formed at the interface between high&#8208;Ni cathodes and carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes have been quantitatively analyzed with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), systematically elucidating the interrelationships among the reaction products, especially under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unwanted cathode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions remain a major challenge to the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high temperatures. This study presents a quantitative analysis on gaseous, soluble, and solid byproducts generated by reactions between LiNiO2 and carbonate electrolytes. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) outgassing profiles reveal the emergence of a pre&#8208;plateau region as temperature increases, characterized by two small plateaus at 3.7 and 4.0&#160;V, which are attributed to catalytic ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) decomposition and ethylene carbonate (EC) hydrolysis, respectively. Activation energies for electrolyte oxidation reactions are quantified with OEMS, confirming that the main outgassing event is driven by direct oxygen&#8208;electrolyte chemical reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show that EC decomposition yields both soluble and solid byproducts, while EMC produces mainly solid species, leading to a thicker, organic&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase; the presence of LiPF6 further accelerates solvent degradation. Additionally, the effectiveness of various dopants in suppressing gas evolution is evaluated across a broad temperature range, with magnesium&#8208;doped cathodes exhibiting the most effective suppression by stabilizing lattice oxygen. Overall, this work establishes a clear correlation among triphasic side&#8208;reaction products, guiding rational design of cathode materials and electrolyte formulations for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Waste&#8208;Free Closed&#8208;Loop&#8208;Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyimide Aerogels Utilizing Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for thermally recyclable poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented. Prepared from furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) and bismaleimide, these aerogels offer thermal superinsulation and excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical performance. Notably, they can be depolymerized into soluble oligomers at elevated temperatures, which can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels&#8212;enabling efficient, waste&#8208;free, closed&#8208;loop recycling.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of lightweight materials with ultralow thermal conductivity and high porosity, widely used in applications such as thermal insulation, energy storage, and aerospace engineering. Among them, polyimide aerogels stand out for their excellent thermal stability, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance. However, their permanently cross&#8208;linked networks make them non&#8208;recyclable, posing a significant sustainability challenge. Here, a novel closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for polyimide aerogels based on dynamic Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented, utilizing an aerogel&#8211;sol&#8211;aerogel (ASA) process. Matrimid, a commercial polyimide, is post&#8208;functionalized with furfurylamine to form a furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) (PAI&#8208;FU), which reacts with bismaleimide via a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to create a thermally reversible cross&#8208;linked aerogel network. The resulting poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels (PAIAs) exhibit low bulk density (&#8776; 0.15 g cm&#8722;3), high porosity (&gt; 87%), ultralow thermal conductivity (16.0 mWm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), excellent thermal stability (Td5% &#8776; 400&#160;&#176;C), and remarkable mechanical strength (&#8776; 3.4 MPa). More importantly, PAIAs can be depolymerized at elevated temperatures into soluble oligomers that can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels without catalysts or purification steps. The recycled PAIAs retain their nanostructural morphology and key aerogel&#8208;specific properties, demonstrating efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling. This approach paves the way for advanced and sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Bionic Nanogel Interfaces Unlock Long&#8208;Term Stability in Zn Metal Electrodeposition&#8208;Based Electrochromic Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layer bionic nanogel interlayer is introduced on Zn and transparent electrodes. Each layer has unique functions: the top hydrophobic layer mitigates water corrosion and suppresses by products, the middle fluorinated layer ensures uniform Zn ion transport, and the bottom colloidal layer dynamically adapts to the substrate. This design greatly enhances electrochemical performance and stability for advanced electrochromic windows.

Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal electrodeposition&#8208;based electrochromic windows (AZWs) are a promising dynamic window technology due to their use of low&#8208;cost, nonflammable, nontoxic, and highly conductive aqueous electrolytes. However, their development is hindered by issues such as poor reversibility, byproduct formation, and hydrogen evolution, which limit the optical window and cycling lifespan. Herein, a bionic transparent nanogel interlayer (TGI) in triple&#8208;layer structure introduced on both Zn electrode and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode is demonstrated to achieve highly reversible electrochemical reaction. In the spontaneously formed triple&#8208;layer nanogel architecture, the top hydrophobic protective layer effectively mitigates water corrosion and suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions as well as byproduct formation. The middle layer incorporates internal fluorinated functional groups to promote uniform and rapid Zn ion transport. The bottom colloidal adhesion layer dynamically adapts to the substrate surface, preventing detachment due to morphology changes during cyclic Zn deposition/stripping processes. Consequently, the AZWs incorporating TGI@Zn and TGI@ITO glass electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and solar heat modulation abilities, which are attributed to their enhanced reversibility and uniform deposition of Zn ions. Compared with the single&#8208;layer interlayer, the three&#8208;layer structure design significantly improves the electrode's stability and performance, providing new ideas for designing next&#8208;generation AZW electrodes.

A dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered strategy is developed to construct Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped CuSe quantum dots (GZC QDs) via cation exchange using CuSe as a template. By precisely introducing Cu and Se vacancies, the optimized sample efficiently facilitates the selective photocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving an HMF conversion rate of 89% and a DFF selectivity of up to 91%.








Abstract
Highly &#8208;active/&#8208;selective photocatalytic biomass conversion is of great importance for achieving remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. However, serious challenges, e.g., limited photon utilization, high charge recombination, and sluggish/uncontrolled reaction kinetics, remain for further development in this area. Herein, a dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineering strategy is employed to regulate the Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Se (GZC) quantum dots (QDs) by a cation exchange route utilizing the CuSe template. The optimized GZC QDs exhibit excellent photocatalytic performances for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), with 89% HMF conversion and 91% DFF selectivity. Advanced ex situ/in situ characterizations, together with theoretical calculations, reveal the origins of the excellent performance: i) Zn doping enhances charge carrier mobility, thereby promoting the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;DFF conversion rate; ii) Ga doping introduces intermediate states in electronic structure, facilitating better charge separation/transfer; iii) Ga/Zn co&#8208;introduction results in formation of Se/Cu vacancies, which play a critical role in charge separation and reactive oxygen species generation. Overall, the research exhibits a rational strategy for designing vacancy&#8208;engineered photocatalysts, offering a promising approach for selective biomass conversion.

         <title>Advanced Thermal Interface Materials: Insights into Low&#8208;Temperature Sintering and High Thermal Conductivity of MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgO has emerged as a promising candidate for improving thermal management in battery systems owing to its high thermal conductivity. In this study, it is demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of MgO is historically underestimated due to previously overlooked material behaviors. Furthermore, MgO&#8208;based TIMs can make a significant contribution to EV safety due to their excellent heat dissipation properties.








Abstract
The escalating frequency of electric vehicle (EV) fires has underscored the critical importance of effective thermal&#8208;management in battery package (TMBP). A key challenge in current TMBP lies with the low thermal conductivity (TC, 3&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) of commercial alumina&#8208;polymer composite (thermal interface materials, TIM). While magnesia (MgO) TIMs, which show high TC (8&#8211;10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, this study) and low cost, are emerging as an alternative heat&#8208;dissipation material (HDM), their full potential remains untapped. Here, the development of novel MgO (&#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and MgO TIMs is presented as next&#8208;generation HDMs, designed to outperform conventional alumina (20&#8211;30&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and alumina TIMs. Crucially, the fundamental mechanisms enabling our new MgO to achieve an unprecedented TC of &#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are elucidated, significantly surpassing the previously reported range of 40&#8211;60&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This study provides fundamental insights into achieving such high thermal conductivity in MgO. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this novel MgO TIM cools EV batteries three times faster than commercial alternatives, offering a robust solution for effective EV fire prevention. Consequently, this high&#8208;TC MgO is poised to contribute significantly to enhancing EV safety.

&lt;p&gt;MgO has emerged as a promising candidate for improving thermal management in battery systems owing to its high thermal conductivity. In this study, it is demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of MgO is historically underestimated due to previously overlooked material behaviors. Furthermore, MgO-based TIMs can make a significant contribution to EV safety due to their excellent heat dissipation properties.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating frequency of electric vehicle (EV) fires has underscored the critical importance of effective thermal-management in battery package (TMBP). A key challenge in current TMBP lies with the low thermal conductivity (TC, 3&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of commercial alumina-polymer composite (thermal interface materials, TIM).

Here, the development of novel MgO (&#8805; 80&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and MgO TIMs is presented as next-generation HDMs, designed to outperform conventional alumina (20&#8211;30&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and alumina TIMs. Crucially, the fundamental mechanisms enabling our new MgO to achieve an unprecedented TC of &#8805; 80&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are elucidated, significantly surpassing the previously reported range of 40&#8211;60&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Visualization of Thermal&#8208;Induced Degradation Pathways of High&#8208;Ni Cathode: a Comparative Study in Solid Chloride and Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes face challenges like oxygen release and thermal instability at high temperatures. In&#8208;situ heating STXM&#8208;ptychography reveals opposite degradation pathways in solid and liquid electrolytes: core&#8208;to&#8208;surface in solids and surface&#8208;to&#8208;core in liquids. Degradation correlates with particle size, with solid electrolytes stabilizing smaller particles. These findings emphasize electrolyte chemistry's role in thermal stability and safer battery design.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich&#8208;layered oxide cathodes are promising candidates for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Higher energy density leads to severe oxygen release, poor thermal stability, and safety risks, as exothermic side reactions induce complex structural and chemical transformations at elevated temperatures. Herein, in&#8208;situ heating scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM)&#8208;ptychography to directly investigate the thermal degradation pathways of charged LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 in both solid chloride and liquid electrolytes is employed. A key finding is the opposite spatial degradation behavior: in solid electrolytes, oxygen loss and Ni reduction occur from the core to surface, while in liquid electrolytes, the degradation proceeds from surface to core. These observations are closely linked to the local structural disorder around Ni atoms, as oxygen loss directly weakens the Ni&#9472;O bonding environment, promoting the reduction of Ni and accelerating lattice instability at high temperatures. Additionally, the extent of degradation is found to correlate with particle size, with solid electrolytes effectively stabilizing smaller particles. These results reveal strong spatial heterogeneity in thermal degradation and highlight the critical role of electrolyte chemistry in dictating thermal stability. Our study provides new insights into the structural and chemical evolution of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under thermal stress, offering valuable guidance for the design of safer, high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Ultra&#8208;Thin p&#8208;Type BiCuSeO Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D BiCuSeO films, grown using molecular beam epitaxy, demonstrate a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Intrinsic ferroelectric transitions have been uncovered through piezoelectric force microscopy signals, which exhibit typical butterfly curves in amplitude and 180&#176; phase switching. This is further corroborated by the processes involved in writing and reading ferroelectric domains within the BiCuSeO films.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, where polarization switching transpires within the channel material itself, are pivotal to advancing the next generation of high&#8208;performance electronics. Nevertheless, the challenge remains in either the controllable synthesis of films or the manipulation of associated ferroelectricity. Here, 2D p&#8208;type BiCuSeO (BCSO) films with a thickness down to &#8776;3 nm are successfully synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. The room&#8208;temperature (RT) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy, showing robust ferroelectric switching capability. Insights derived from density functional theory, coupled with the ferroelectric dipole map in cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images, suggest that the polar displacement of [CuSe] layers under electric fields primarily contributes to ferroelectricity in the BCSO film. Furthermore, the switching behavior of the BCSO&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junction has been clarified, exhibiting distinct ON and OFF states. Our results illustrate that such an ultrathin RT ferroelectric semiconductor could serve as a versatile material for future multifunctional electronic devices.

         <title>Dimensional Crossover Engineering in MoS2/Organic Superlattices Breaks the zT Barrier for 2D Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered microelectronics require thermoelectric devices (TEDs) with high efficiency and silicon compatibility. This study overcomes these challenges using dimensionally engineered MoS2/organic superlattices that facilitate electrical transport and reduce thermal conductivity. A record zT of 0.6 at 373 K is achieved&#8212;12 times higher than monolayer MoS2&#8212;enabling integration of high&#8208;performance 2D TEDs into microchips for Internet of things and wearables.








Abstract
The rapid development of self&#8208;powered microelectronics demands thermoelectric devices (TEDs) that can simultaneously achieve high energy conversion efficiency and silicon micro&#8208;fabrication compatibility. While for conventional bulk TEs, their incompatibility with silicon micro&#8208;manufacturing restricts microelectronic integration. 2D materials, though CMOS&#8208;fabrication&#8208;friendly and widely explored for microelectronic devices, face critical limitations in thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency due to their low zT values (&lt;0.2) stemming from unfavorable thermal conductivity&#8208;power factor tradeoffs. These challenges are overcome through orbital&#8208;property&#8208;driven dimensional engineering of hybrid MoS2/organic superlattices, which synergistically enhances electrical transport while suppressing thermal conductivity. Strain&#8208;adaptive intercalation of tert&#8208;butylamine (TBA) molecules creates MoS2 bilayer superlattices exhibiting an electronic structure crossover between monolayer&#8208;like and bulk&#8208;like characteristics, thereby maximizing the density of states near the Fermi level. The optimized MoS2 bilayer/TBA hybrid superlattice achieves a breakthrough zT of 0.6 at 373 K &#8211; 12&#8208;fold higher than monolayer counterparts and 100&#215; surpassing bulk crystals. This represents the highest experimentally reported zT for 2D material&#8208;based TEDs, approaching performance benchmarks of commercial bulk TEs. The work establishes a paradigm of dimensional engineering in hybrid superlattices, thus enabling integration of high&#8208;efficiency 2D materials&#8208;based TEDs into silicon microelectronics&#8211;a critical step toward self&#8208;powered IoT systems and wearable technologies.

Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid phase change materials (PCMs) hold great promise for addressing challenges in thermal energy storage and temperature management. Yet, they suffer from severe issues of melting leakage and crystalline rigidity in practical applications. Here, an approach is proposed to achieve flexible, high&#8208;latent heat PCMs with intrinsic softness and toughness in the crystalline state through the combination of dual polymer networks and inorganic salt hydrates. This strategy constructs salogels via in situ polymerization, leveraging strong polymer&#8211;ion&#8211;water interactions and introducing excess water to form a solvated polymer network embedded within crystalline salt hydrates. The prepared crystalline salogels demonstrated high energy density (&#8710;Hm, 179&#8211;209 J g&#8722;1) with ultra&#8208;soft (E, 0.05&#8211;5&#160;MPa) yet strong (&#963;b, 1&#8211;3&#160;MPa) and tough (&#915;, 2&#8211;6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) mechanical performance, along with low contact thermal resistance (Rc = 0.03 cm2 K W&#8722;1). The fabricated thermal management devices present both phase&#8208;change&#8208;driven heat absorption and hygroscopicity&#8208;driven moisture absorption, enabling highly efficient thermal regulation, with a 10&#160;&#176;C reduction observed in a lab suit fitted with a 25 &#215; 15 &#215; 0.5&#160;cm3 salogel patch over 1&#160;h compared to one without the patch.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision 3D Doping of Fused Silica Glass Derived from Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local integration of dopants enables the selective modification of color, luminescence or refractive index within a three&#8208;dimensionally shaped glass with micron resolution. Following the fabrication of porous glass preforms and infusion with a dopant mixture, the dopant is immobilized by lithographic techniques and subsequently debinded and sintered. This enables to integrate functions in complex&#8208;shaped glass components.








Abstract
Glasses are utilized for their outstanding optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. However, conventional production methods mostly yield in glasses with uniform compositions and material properties. Here a novel lithographic approach is presented for high&#8208;resolution 3D dopant integration at defined positions, which enables property modifications in specific regions. For this, a porous glass matrix derived from nanocomposites is shaped using 3D printing or injection molding. Using volumetric 3D printing like computed axial or two&#8208;photon lithography, doping is performed within the porous glass using photocurable metal oxide precursors. The dopant is then permanently integrated within the glass during a final sintering step. The local integration of dopants like Ti4+, Co2+, Eu3+ or Tb3+ allow to selectively change the color, luminescence or refractive index within a 3D&#8208;shaped glass with micron resolution. The process enables a wide range of novel applications from integrated optics and photonics to mass customization, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information storage.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation for the Well&#8208;Distribution of Electrons and Zn2+ Ions Achieving Uniform Zn Redox in Ah&#8208;Scale Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneer a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces are designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Thanks to the dynamic regulation, Zn&#8208;halogen and Zn&#8208;manganese Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells exhibit favorable rate performance and cycle stability.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of the electric field and zinc ion (Zn2+), and crosstalk effects all lead to irreversible redox of Zn, eventually accelerating the failure of various Zn&#8208;metal energy storage devices, especially Ah&#8208;scale pouch batteries. This study pioneers a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces is designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Due to the large electron delocalized space, the additives with delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonds and &#8210;COOH form a stable molecular layer for the Zn anode. This layer can effectively prevent side reactions and dynamically regulate the arrangement of electrons and Zn2+ ions by driving electrons to flow among conjugated atoms and functional groups, ultimately evening out the electric field and reaction sites of Zn2+ ions during the Zn redox process. Thanks to this dynamic regulation, the Ah&#8208;scale Zn//I2 pouch cell exhibits a high capacity of 1.473 Ah (188.7 Wh kg&#8722;1) at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding rate performance. This dynamic regulation also presents great compatibility with Zn&#8208;manganese pouch cells and Zn&#8208;bromine cells. This work deepens the understanding of the regulation mechanism for highly reversible Ah&#8208;scale AZIBs.

         <title>Soft Robotic Engines with Non&#8208;Reciprocal Motion by Physical Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Movement is vital, and it requires breaking symmetry. This study introduces a hydrogel engine that achieves non&#8208;reciprocal motion through kinetic asymmetry in repeated actuation cycles. This approach for breaststroke&#8208;swimming&#8208;like motion is embedded inside the material and establishes a new paradigm of physical intelligence for soft robotics.








Abstract
Movement is essential for living systems, enabling access to food, habitats, or escape from threats. Across scales, a key unifying principle is symmetry breaking to achieve non&#8208;reciprocal motion and accumulate work. In soft robotics, many actuators mimic biological responsiveness, but they typically exhibit reciprocal motion, where forward work is canceled in the return stroke &#8211; preventing work accumulation in cyclic operation. Here, a simple and broadly applicable hydrogel engine concept is presented that overcomes this limitation by encoding kinetic asymmetry into swelling and deswelling transitions. This hard&#8208;coded asymmetry yields non&#8208;reciprocal motion trajectories, enabling continuous mechanical work extraction under a single, uniform stimulus &#8211; without complex external control. The strategy embodies a material&#8208;based ratchet mechanism rooted in physical intelligence, independent of geometry or scale, and generalizable across stimuli. This hydrogel engine is implemented in soft robotic systems, including artificial cilia for fluid pumping and conveyor belts for object transport. Starting from macroscopic thermoresponsive systems, the design is extended to microscale formats via 3D printing and to other stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This approach shifts the paradigm in soft robotics &#8211; from increasing chemical complexity to leveraging intrinsic material properties for emergent function &#8211; paving the way for scalable, autonomous systems driven by physical intelligence.

         <title>Linear and Symmetric Artificial Synapses Driven by Hydrogen Bonding for Accurate and Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven interface engineering enables highly linear and symmetric artificial synapses based on CsPbI3&#8211;PVA hybrids. This strategy suppresses trap states and guides directional ion migration, yielding stable optoelectronic plasticity. The devices achieve ultralow power operation and human&#8208;like learning in neuromorphic networks, offering a scalable route for edge AI and cognitive computing systems.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by integrating memory and processing to emulate synaptic behavior. Artificial synapses enable this functionality through analog conductance modulation, low&#8208;power operation, and nanoscale integration. Halide perovskites with high ionic mobilities and solution processabilities have emerged as promising materials for such devices; however, inherent stochastic ion migration and thermal instability lead to asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics, ultimately impairing their learning and inference capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface engineering strategy to stabilize CsPbI3 artificial synapses. Density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses indicate that the hydroxyl groups in PVA form robust O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; bonds with surface iodides, promoting vertical lattice ordering. This suppresses grain boundary defects and enables directional ion migration, resulting in extremely linear and symmetric optoelectronic conductance modulation (&#945;p = 0.004, &#945;d = 0.020), over eight fold reduction in interfacial trap density, and high&#8208;temperature retention (&gt;104 s). When integrated into a neural network, artificial synapses show large&#8208;scale image classification accuracy within 1.62% of the theoretical limit. The proposed strategy provides a scalable pathway toward overcoming the existing limitations of artificial synapses, exhibiting high potential for application in edge AI, autonomous systems, and material&#8208;based cognitive modeling.

&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by integrating memory and processing to emulate synaptic behavior. Artificial synapses enable this functionality through analog conductance modulation, low-power operation, and nanoscale integration. Halide perovskites with high ionic mobilities and solution processabilities have emerged as promising materials for such devices; however, inherent stochastic ion migration and thermal instability lead to asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics, ultimately impairing their learning and inference capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogen-bonding interface engineering strategy to stabilize CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; artificial synapses. Density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses indicate that the hydroxyl groups in PVA form robust O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bonds with surface iodides, promoting vertical lattice ordering. This suppresses grain boundary defects and enables directional ion migration, resulting in extremely linear and symmetric optoelectronic conductance modulation (&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.004, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.020), over eight fold reduction in interfacial trap density, and high-temperature retention (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s). When integrated into a neural network, artificial synapses show large-scale image classification accuracy within 1.62% of the theoretical limit. The proposed strategy provides a scalable pathway toward overcoming the existing limitations of artificial synapses, exhibiting high potential for application in edge AI, autonomous systems, and material-based cognitive modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Living Artificial Dura Mater for Efficient Therapy of Central Nervous System Injury Based on Neuronal Differentiation and Neuroprotective A2 Astrocyte Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible living artificial dura mater, which composed of &#8220;living&#8221; neural stem cell coating and flexible Au nanostrips patch, shows optimal interface integration with tissue, improves the immune microenvironment of defect site, promotes the survival and differentiation of NSCs in harsh inflammatory environment, and exerts positive therapeutic effects on the recovery of sensory and motor neural circuits after spinal cord injury.








Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) injury is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. To prevent secondary cascade damages to CNS caused by dural defects, the repair of dural defects is an essential step in CNS injury treatment. Although various artificial dura maters have been developed, unfortunately, no one exerting positive therapeutic effects for CNS injury repair. Here, we suggested a flexible &#8220;living&#8221; artificial dura mater as a general strategy for CNS injury treatment by integrating the neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and electrical stimulation. Under a rotating magnetic field based on magnetoelectric induction, NSCs seeded on a specially designed flexible patch with Au nanostrips produced therapeutic benefits to CNS injury. In vitro experiments prove that the magnetic field&#8208;driven Au nanostrips&#8208;mediated wireless electrical stimulation not only effectively accelerates NSCs differentiating into mature neurons with complex synaptic connections, but also induces astrocytes directionally activating into neuroprotective A2 reactive astrocytes. In vivo experiments with traumatic brain or spinal cord injury models confirm that the flexible living artificial dura mater shows optimal interface integration with tissue, effectively improving the immune microenvironment of the defect site, promoting the survival and differentiation of NSCs, and aiding the recovery of motor neural circuits after injury.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Mechano Symbiosis Dual&#8208;Mode Janus Bioaerogel for Context&#8208;Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting Beyond Solar Reliance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA), capable of efficient atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar dependency, is created. The inherent hygroscopicity from the bio&#8208;based matrix and strongly anchored LiCl endow DBJA with excellent moisture harvesting capacity. The DBJA demonstrates outstanding advantages in solar&#8208;independent operation, adsorption, desorption, sustainability, and scalability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SS&#8208;AWH) offers promise for addressing global freshwater scarcity. However, the SS&#8208;AWH heavily relies on favorable and sustained solar irradiation; yet real&#8208;world solar irradiation exhibits significant spatiotemporal fluctuations, limiting its sustainable application, as non/low&#8208;light conditions sharply reduce water productivity. This constraint is fundamentally due to the singleness of the water release pathway via photothermal desorption. Here, a novel dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA) is presented, enabling efficient, all&#8208;weather, multi&#8208;scenario atmospheric water harvesting via selectively solar&#8208;driven and compression&#8208;activated water release. The Janus structure optimizes mass/heat transfer between hygroscopic and photothermal domains, achieving the most balanced adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics and compression&#8208;recovery strength for solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis. Under favorable sunlight, DBJA demonstrates a competitive water release efficiency of 1.32 g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 outdoors. Crucially, without solar irradiation, DBJA achieves a total water productivity of 12.80 g g&#8722;1 over 5&#8208;cycle adsorption&#8208;compression with 98% volume recovery and is stable within 50 cycles. Enhanced physical inlay and multiple chemical interactions ensure limited leakage of Li+ ions during compression, and the collected water easily conforms to the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards. This work provides a flexible approach for sustainable atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar reliance through multi&#8208;mode synergy and gradient architecture.

Abstract
Reversible solid oxide cells (R&#8208;SOCs) are promising for energy applications but face limitations due to poor durability and slow oxygen&#8208;reduction/evolution reactions at air electrodes. Here, a high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based (HEP) tri&#8208;phase composite, (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)xCoO3&#8208;&#948;, comprising an A&#8208;site deficient La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2CoO3&#8208;&#948;, doped&#8208;CeO2, and Co3O4 phases are presented. The HEP phase provides catalytic sites and robust frameworks, the doped&#8208;CeO2 phase enhances oxygen&#8208;ion transport; and the Co3O4 nanoparticles offer additional active sites. The optimized (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)0.7CoO3&#8208;&#948; electrode exhibits promising electrochemical performance: a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.058 &#937; cm2 at 700&#160;&#176;C and enhance stability (a 2&#8208;fold improvement in ambient air, a 6&#8208;fold enhancement in moisture resistance, and a 3&#8208;fold increase in Cr tolerance compare to (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#120575;). When applied as an air electrode for R&#8208;SOCs, it delivers excellent performance at 800&#160;&#176;C: a peak power density of 1.68&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell (FC); a current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.2&#160;V in electrolysis cell (EC). Significantly, this work represents the first application of a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide&#8208;based material as an air electrode in large&#8208;area R&#8208;SOCs (10&#215;10 cm2). The assembled R&#8208;SOC achieves an output of 61&#160;W in FC and 66 A at 1.18&#160;V in EC at 800&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

Inspired by fibrin's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) recapitulates natural coagulation networks by replicating the aggregation state and maturation process of fibrin through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet, which achieves hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition.









Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and deep trauma restricts the effective hemostasis and tissue regeneration management, even causing death. The formation of the fibrin network is the initial stage of wound control. Inspired by Fn's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) is designed to achieve hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition. pCSF/&#946; replicates the aggregation state and maturation process of Fn through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet to recapitulate natural coagulation networks, achieving mechanical reinforcement and shape recovery. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses reveal that pCSF/&#946; connects hemostasis and regeneration through platelet contents&#8217; release and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The results of incompressible hemostasis, large&#8208;area skin repair, and penetrating liver regeneration in animal models such as minipigs confirm pCSF/&#946; is superior to clinical products in rapid hemostasis and synchronous tissue regeneration. The molecular design of pCSF/&#946; provides new insights for developing biomaterials in rapid hemostasis and simultaneous regeneration.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 Nanosheets for Enhanced Thermoelectric Catalytic&#8208;Ferroptotic Therapy</title>

n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs, utilizing Cu self&#8208;doping and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 modified, can achieve decoupling and optimize thermal and electrical transport properties, thereby enhancing the TEC effect. Additionally, the presence of Cu at the Zn sites increases carrier concentration and enhances POD&#8208;like activity. When combined with ferroptosis, these features lead to efficient ROS generation and GSH depletion, resulting in satisfactory therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, a rapidly advancing field in medical therapy, encounters challenges in achieving efficient thermal and electrical transport properties within the limited thermal range compatible with biological systems. This study presents a high&#8208;performance thermoelectric catalytic therapy (TECT) utilizing Cu self&#8208;doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 nanosheets synthesized with non&#8208;stoichiometric ratios modified with DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 (n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs). Under 808 nm laser irradiation, n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs demonstrate an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.62%, rapidly establishing a significant local temperature gradient. This increase in temperature initiates thermoelectric catalysis (TEC), effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are toxic to cancer cells. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs at room temperature is observed to be 45.45% higher than that of pure phase CZTSe. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that lattice disorder and the presence of highly degenerate electronic bands at the band edges decouple thermal and electrical transport, enhancing the TEC effect. The additional copper ions at zinc sites increase carrier concentration, hole conductivity, and peroxidase&#8208;like activity, thereby enhancing ROS production, depleting glutathione, accelerating lipid peroxidation, and inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Consequently, a synergistic TECT and ferroptosis effect is achieved, resulting in significant anti&#8208;cancer efficacy.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Bi Catalytic Pair Enables Selective Superoxide Radical Generation for Simultaneous Removal of Organic Pollutants and Heavy Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new oxygen activation regulation catalyst, with a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a double d10 electronic configuration, and a model for the synergistic treatment of complex water pollutants, is constructed. This catalytic system can selectively activate O2 to generate superoxide radicals, thereby achieving efficient synergistic removal of Cr(VI) and ciprofloxacin.








Abstract
Manipulating exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transfer processes to selectively generate redox&#8208;capable superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) for the removal of antibiotic&#8208;heavy metal&#8208;combined pollutants is challenging. To address this issue, a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a dual d10 electronic configuration is constructed. The incorporation of Zn atoms into the lattice results in the formation of a Zn&#8208;Ov&#8208;Bi defect structure, thereby enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field by 5.1 times. This synergistically promotes exciton dissociation at oxygen vacancies and the directional migration of carriers. This strategy achieves an excellent charge mobility (3.76 ps) and selective activation of O2 to O2&#8226;&#8722; (selectivity: 86.6%, 2.01 mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, an increase of 2.57 times). Owing to the unique charge separation mechanism, ZBOB performs excellently in the treatment of complex environmental pollutants, with simultaneous removal rates of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI) reaching 0.55 and 0.41 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are four and three times higher than those of the unmodified catalyst, respectively. The catalyst exhibits excellent cycling performance and stability for the simultaneous removal of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI). These findings highlight the mechanisms underlying the charge transfer and selective generation of free radicals and provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Robust Flexible Superhydrophobic Film with Skin&#8208;Inspired Gradient Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable, robust, flexible superhydrophobic film with skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is successfully proposed by utilizing a force&#8208;engineered wool rolling technique, which facilitates the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer by pressure, electrostatic force, and enhanced capillary force. The resulting superhydrophobic film demonstrates excellent freestanding flexibility, mechanical robustness, weather resistance, and anti&#8208;icing performance.








Abstract
Flexible superhydrophobic materials are attractive in separation technology, thermal management, anti&#8208;icing, and wearable electronics since their adaptability to curved surfaces and deformation. However, their fragility and high susceptibility to abrasion, caused by the destruction of micro/nano structures, remain significant challenges. A skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is proposed to combine flexibility and superhydrophobicity by facilitating the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer through pressure, electrostatic forces, and enhanced capillary forces. The resulting freestanding superhydrophobic film demonstrates remarkable flexibility and robust superhydrophobicity against strain (70%), stretching or bending (&gt;5000 cycles), Taber abrasion (400 cycles), UV aging (&gt;1500 h), and salt spray corrosion (&gt;40 days). Combined with the low thermal conductivity, it exhibits high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;icing (icing delay time of &#8776;320 s) and durable de&#8208;icing (ice adhesion strength of &#8776;45 kPa, with no significant alterations over 20 icing/de&#8208;icing cycles). Additionally, its skin&#8208;like breathability and sensing support underwater electronics. This skin&#8208;inspired gradient strategy offers a promising paradigm for engineering freestanding, flexible, robust superhydrophobic materials design.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Energy Transmission Mechanism of Switchable Quasi&#8208;Dipole Distribution in Triboelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;field electrostatic energy transmission system is developed based on a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution charge model at the triboelectric interface, enabling applications in a wireless air purification and conductive pattern mapping.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field energy transmission is important for wireless power supply in separated or isolated space. Electrostatic energy generated by triboelectrification is typically confined to the triboelectric interface and is hard to transmit in distance due to limited understanding of tribo&#8208;charge distribution and transfer behavior. Here, it is found that positive and negative tribo&#8208;charges spontaneously form a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution at the dynamic triboelectric interface. Driven by the strong electric field of this quasi&#8208;dipole configuration, the extraction of electrostatic energy breaks traditional limitations and enables short&#8208;distance transmission through dielectric and air media, without the need for any auxiliary circuits. A high transmission efficiency of 65.2% is achieved through a 5&#160;mm dielectric medium by efficiently matching the electric field distribution with a collector structure and minimizing transmission loss. Finally, an air purification system and a conductor pattern mapping platform are developed by utilizing the wireless transmitted electrostatic energy, achieving air purification and diverse conductor pattern imaging under mechanical stimuli. This work provides an insight into the distribution and transmission of electrostatic energy, promoting its evolution from interfacial research toward spatial applications.

&lt;p&gt;A high-efficiency near-field electrostatic energy transmission system is developed based on a switchable quasi-dipole distribution charge model at the triboelectric interface, enabling applications in a wireless air purification and conductive pattern mapping.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-field energy transmission is important for wireless power supply in separated or isolated space. Electrostatic energy generated by triboelectrification is typically confined to the triboelectric interface and is hard to transmit in distance due to limited understanding of tribo-charge distribution and transfer behavior. Here, it is found that positive and negative tribo-charges spontaneously form a switchable quasi-dipole distribution at the dynamic triboelectric interface. Driven by the strong electric field of this quasi-dipole configuration, the extraction of electrostatic energy breaks traditional limitations and enables short-distance transmission through dielectric and air media, without the need for any auxiliary circuits. A high transmission efficiency of 65.2% is achieved through a 5&#160;mm dielectric medium by efficiently matching the electric field distribution with a collector structure and minimizing transmission loss. Finally, an air purification system and a conductor pattern mapping platform are developed by utilizing the wireless transmitted electrostatic energy, achieving air purification and diverse conductor pattern imaging under mechanical stimuli. This work provides an insight into the distribution and transmission of electrostatic energy, promoting its evolution from interfacial research toward spatial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Modulated Asymmetric Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Enabling Durable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring Co&#8722;N3P1 active sites anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from MOFs is rationally designed as an iodine cathode host, demonstrating enhanced iodine redox kinetics and cycling stability through synergistic electronic modulation and confinement effects, thus offering insights for long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The rational design of catalytic host materials with optimized electronic structures and confined architectures is crucial for addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this study, an asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst is developed by anchoring Co&#8722;N3P1 sites on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The coordination engineering of Co centers via phosphorus incorporation disrupts the symmetry of conventional Co&#8722;N4 configurations, enhancing charge redistribution and reducing the energy barrier for iodine dissociation as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Systematic optimization reveals that moderate Co and P doping balances active sites and electronic conductivity, achieving strong chemical adsorption of polyiodides while maintaining structural stability. In situ Raman and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopies confirm effective confinement of iodine species and reversible iodine conversion. The optimized C3/I2 cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability, retaining a specific capacity of 100.6 mA h g&#8722;1 after 50,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, practical applicability is demonstrated in flexible soft&#8208;pack batteries and 3D&#8208;printed/screen&#8208;printed micro&#8208;batteries, showing its potential for scalable energy storage. This work presents a heteroatom&#8208;modulation strategy for designing efficient catalytic hosts in conversion&#8208;type batteries.

         <title>Isoquinoline as an Electrolyte Additive for Electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries: Superior Cycling Stability and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoquinoline (C9H7N, 500 mg L&#8722;1) stabilizes Zn plating/stripping via surface adsorption and solvation shell modification in strongly acidic chloride&#8208;based electrolytes, enabling stability over 3650 cycles for electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 full batteries. It also facilitates a zinc metal anode&#8208;free design with &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 area capacity and &#8776;1.9 V discharge voltage, highlighting its critical role in advancing high&#8208;performance electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries hold great promise for energy storage applications owing to their high theoretical electromotive force and energy density. However, the zinc anode suffers from severe corrosion in strongly acidic electrolytes, leading to hydrogen evolution, low zinc utilization, and premature battery failure. To address these challenges, isoquinoline is introduced as an additive in a chloride&#8208;based acidic electrolyte. Isoquinoline molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn surface and incorporate into the Zn2+ solvation sheath, thereby effectively suppressing zinc corrosion and enhancing Zn plating/stripping reversibility in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations. At an optimized concentration of 500 mg L&#8722;1 isoquinoline, the modified electrolyte enables the electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 battery to achieve outstanding cycling stability, delivering 3650 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 98%, demonstrating highly competitive cycling performance among reported electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 systems. Furthermore, this electrolyte modulation supports the development of a zinc metal anode&#8208;free full cell, which delivers a high areal discharge capacity of &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 and maintains a stable discharge voltage plateau of &#8776;1.9 V. These findings underscore the pivotal role of isoquinoline in stabilizing the zinc interface and advancing the performance of electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>TriMag Microrobots: 3D&#8208;Printed Microrobots for Magnetic Actuation, Imaging, and Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TriMag microrobots are two&#8208;photon polymerized hydrogel structures embedded with in situ synthesized Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, enabling magnetic actuation, high&#8208;resolution magnetic particle imaging (MPI), and efficient magnetothermal heating for deep&#8208;tissue biomedical interventions including tracking, navigation, and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Microrobots hold immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug delivery, disease diagnostics, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, two key challenges hinder their clinical translation: achieving scalable and precision fabrication, and enabling non&#8208;invasive imaging and tracking within deep biological tissues. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a cutting&#8208;edge imaging modality, addresses these challenges by detecting the magnetization of nanoparticles and visualizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with sub&#8208;millimeter resolution, free from interference by biological tissues. This capability makes MPI an ideal tool for tracking magnetic microrobots in deep tissue environments. In this study, &#8220;TriMag&#8221; microrobots are introduced: 3D&#8208;printed microrobots with three integrated magnetic functionalities&#8212;magnetic actuation, magnetic particle imaging, and magnetic hyperthermia. The TriMag microrobots are fabricated using an innovative method that combines two&#8208;photon lithography for 3D printing biocompatible hydrogel structures with in situ chemical reactions to embed the hydrogel scaffold with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for good MPI contrast and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles for efficient magnetothermal heating. This approach enables scalable, precise fabrication of helical magnetic hydrogel microrobots. The resulting TriMag microrobots, with the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, demonstrate efficient magnetic actuation for controlled movement, precise imaging via MPI for imaging and tracking in biological fluid and organs, including porcine eye and mouse stomach, and magnetothermal heating for tumor ablation in a mouse model. By combining these capabilities, the fabrication and imaging approach provides a robust platform for non&#8208;invasive monitoring and manipulation of microrobots for transformative applications in medical treatment and biological research.

         <title>Design of Electrified Fiber Sorbents for Direct Air Capture with Electrically&#8208;Driven Temperature Vacuum Swing Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;performance interaction of air contactor material and process optimization, electrified fiber sorbent system capable of Joule heating is rationally designed for energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature vacuum swing adsorption for direct air capture.








Abstract
Joule heating is becoming accepted as a highly efficient regeneration technique for temperature vacuum swing adsorption in direct air capture (DAC). This acknowledgment arises from its ability to rapidly generate and transfer heat, along with the&#160;convenience of obtaining electrical power from renewable sources. This study presents a unique electrified fiber&#160;sorbent (i.e., e&#8208;fiber) design&#160;that facilitates Joule heating, enabling energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature&#8208;vacuum swing adsorption (e&#8208;TVSA) for DAC. The e&#8208;fiber sorbent is produced via a dip coating technique, in which a silver composite solution is applied to the surface of an open&#8208;porous polymer matrix. The resulting ultra&#8208;thin, interconnected porous conductive layer on the fiber surface not only minimizes the increase in diffusion resistance even after the surface coating process but also offers exceptionally low electrical resistance (0.5 &#937;&#160;cm&#8722;1). The e&#8208;fiber sorbent module achieves a desorption temperature of 110&#160;&#176;C in 80 s at 3&#160;V. Notably, only a 5% reduction in capacity is recorded following repeated&#160;cycles of e&#8208;TVSA at a CO2 concentration of 400&#160;ppm.

&lt;p&gt;Through in-depth investigation of structure-performance interaction of air contactor material and process optimization, electrified fiber sorbent system capable of Joule heating is rationally designed for energy-efficient electrically-driven temperature vacuum swing adsorption for direct air capture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joule heating is becoming accepted as a highly efficient regeneration technique for temperature vacuum swing adsorption in direct air capture (DAC). This acknowledgment arises from its ability to rapidly generate and transfer heat, along with the&#160;convenience of obtaining electrical power from renewable sources. This study presents a unique electrified fiber&#160;sorbent (i.e., e-fiber) design&#160;that facilitates Joule heating, enabling energy-efficient electrically-driven temperature-vacuum swing adsorption (e-TVSA) for DAC. The e-fiber sorbent is produced via a dip coating technique, in which a silver composite solution is applied to the surface of an open-porous polymer matrix. The resulting ultra-thin, interconnected porous conductive layer on the fiber surface not only minimizes the increase in diffusion resistance even after the surface coating process but also offers exceptionally low electrical resistance (0.5 &#937;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The e-fiber sorbent module achieves a desorption temperature of 110&#160;&#176;C in 80 s at 3&#160;V. Notably, only a 5% reduction in capacity is recorded following repeated&#160;cycles of e-TVSA at a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 400&#160;ppm. The complicated nature of heat transfer processes is clarified caused by Joule heating in the e-fiber sorbent module through detailed case studies conducted with computational simulations, offering insights for design optimization and system engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stiffening Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Liquid Crystal Inclusions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of low molecular weight liquid crystals (LC) into liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) leads to a significant increase in their stiffness and output work density. Such remarkable stiffening is attributed to nanoscale phase&#8208;separation and the formation of induced&#8208;smectic domains in polydomain and monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs, respectively.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are promising building blocks for soft robots, given their large, programmable, reversible, and stimuli&#8208;responsive shape change. Enhancing LCEs&#8217; stiffness and toughness has been a longstanding desire previously explored by reinforcing them with fillers, crystalline microdomains, and interpenetrating polymer networks. While promising, these methods adversely affect molecular order and thermal strain. Here, a significant enhancement of the&#160;stiffness of LCEs is reported by loading them with low molecular weight liquid crystals (LMWLCs) without sacrificing thermal strain and molecular order. While pristine LCEs rapidly transition to a soft elastic plateau when strained from poly&#8208; to monodomain, LC&#8208;loaded samples (LC&#8208;LCEs) first experience a pronounced linear elasticity, followed by a soft elastic plateau at higher stresses. Further thermomechanical and X&#8208;ray analysis confirm the emergence of an additional mesophase in polydomain LC&#8208;LCEs, which evolves to short&#8208;range smectic (cybotactic) during the poly&#8208; to monodomain transition. Monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs show between 6.5&#8208; and 9.0&#8208;fold stiffness enhancement with improved molecular order and thermal strain. Their work densities are more than double that of pristine LCEs, with active thermal stroke of up to 25% under loads of over 2000 times their weight. Such remarkable behaviors are attributed to the interplay between post&#8208;polymerization phase separation of LCs and their strain&#8208;enhanced smectic ordering. The results suggest that LMWLC inclusion can be a simple yet robust method to significantly improve the mechanical properties of LCEs.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing and Melt&#8208;Electrowriting to Fabricate Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed metamaterials with melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell&#8208;laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long&#8208;term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel&#8208;infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Blade&#8208;Coating Process Assisted by a Direct Nonuniform Electric Field</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of fabricating efficient thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer solar cells for industrial production by introducing a non&#8208;contact DC field method during blade coating. The technique optimizes bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology with enhanced vertical phase separation, eventually achieving a record efficiency of 17.59%.








Abstract
The incorporation of thick active layers (&gt;300&#160;nm) is an essential requirement for wide&#8208;scale industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve efficient thick film devices, in particular for all&#8208;polymer OSCs, which are generally considered the most stable type of OSCs. In this study, a simple yet effective method is introduced by using a direct current (DC) field to manipulate the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films within all&#8208;polymer OSCs during a blade coating process. By utilizing this method, a favorable vertical phase distribution is achieved, thereby effectively reducing the electron percolation threshold and enhancing the overall device performance. With this, an outstanding efficiency of 17.59% is achieved for thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer devices by blade&#8208;coating, which is the best performance in this category. This study introduces a non&#8208;contact DC field method aimed at mitigating the fabrication challenges encountered when transitioning thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer systems from laboratory to manufacturing settings, and will potentially contributing to the advancement of the OSC industrialization.

         <title>Band Structure Engineering to Optimize Spin&#8208;Wave Propagation in Weyl ferromagnet Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Band structure engineering in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex enables deterministic control over spin&#8208;wave propagation with ultra&#8208;low magnetic damping. Compositional tuning of the Fermi level yields an optimum Gilbert damping of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a spin&#8208;wave decay length over 100 &#181;m. This work unlocks the magnonic dimension of Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex, developing a multi&#8208;functional and versatile materials platform for magnonics.








Abstract
Spin waves, the quantized excitations of magnetic order, have been widely explored as low&#8208;power information carriers in conventional metallic systems (e.g., NiFe) and insulating materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Recently, magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have emerged as a novel platform for magnonics, leveraging their unique band structures, strong spin&#8208;orbit interactions, and fertile topological behavior. Despite this potential, spin&#8208;wave dynamics in magnetic WSMs remain largely uncharted. In this work, this gap is addressed by investigating spin&#8208;wave propagation in epitaxial Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) thin films, a prototypical magnetic WSMs system. By changing the ratio between Ga and Ge, how band&#8208;structure engineering, specifically tuning the Fermi level into the minority&#8208;spin pseudogap is demonstrated, systematically modulates the electronic and magnetic properties to achieve ultralow Gilbert damping (&#8776;1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3) alongside long spin&#8208;wave decay lengths over 100 &#181;m. These results establish a generalizable strategy for optimizing spin&#8208;wave media while unlocking a materials platform to probe intertwined charge, spin and orbit, with profound implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and magnonic technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin waves, the quantized excitations of magnetic order, have been widely explored as low-power information carriers in conventional metallic systems (e.g., NiFe) and insulating materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Recently, magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have emerged as a novel platform for magnonics, leveraging their unique band structures, strong spin-orbit interactions, and fertile topological behavior. Despite this potential, spin-wave dynamics in magnetic WSMs remain largely uncharted. In this work, this gap is addressed by investigating spin-wave propagation in epitaxial Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnGa&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ge&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#8804; 1) thin films, a prototypical magnetic WSMs system. By changing the ratio between Ga and Ge, how band-structure engineering, specifically tuning the Fermi level into the minority-spin pseudogap is demonstrated, systematically modulates the electronic and magnetic properties to achieve ultralow Gilbert damping (&#8776;1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) alongside long spin-wave decay lengths over 100 &#181;m. These results establish a generalizable strategy for optimizing spin-wave media while unlocking a materials platform to probe intertwined charge, spin and orbit, with profound implications for next-generation spintronic and magnonic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Nanovesicles Derived From Bone Marrow Stromal Cells With Innate Homing Capability for Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>

The biomimetic nanovesicles (mNVs) coated bone marrow targeted delivery system actively delivers core drugs into bone marrow.








Abstract
Precise delivery of pharmaceuticals administered to bone marrow for various bone diseases is challenging, given the bone marrow&#8208;blood barrier (MBB). Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from bone marrow can naturally infiltrate the MBB and home to bone tissue. Here, biomimetic nanovesicles (namely mNVs) engineered with the extracted cell membrane from BMSCs are reported for homing delivery of different core nanomedicines to bone marrow. The cargo&#8208;loaded mNVs exhibited excellent bone targeting in crossing natural barriers is demonstrated to augment drug concentrations in bone marrow, and the bio&#8208;function of mNVs is verified in typical models of chronic metabolic bone disease and metastatic carcinoma. In the induced osteoporosis model, engineered mNVs deliver the nanocore of teriparatide&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid), forming a sustained&#8208;release system of teriparatide, which can significantly slow bone loss, maintain bone mass, and alleviate osteoporosis indicators. In osseous and systematic metastatic breast carcinoma models, the mNVs are employed to deliver DNA tetrahedron embedded doxorubicin and efficiently inhibit tumor progression and osteolytic lesions. This work suggests that high&#8208;efficiency bone marrow delivery of medications can be camouflaged by the cell membrane derived from BMSCs, initiating a new platform for bone targeting drug delivery for developing more effective therapeutics for bone diseases.

         <title>Biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene Quantum&#8208;Confined Nanostructures: A Versatile Janus Platform for Advanced Energy Storage and Catalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene quantum&#8208;confined nanostructure (Ni&#8208;MJQD) serves as a Janus platform, simultaneously achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage and efficient catalytic oxidation. The unique architecture enables superior energy storage performance and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation&#8208;symbolizing &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; for sustainable energy and catalysis.








Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage and ecofriendly catalysts has intensified the search for advanced multifunctional materials. Herein, this work presents the synthesis and characterization of Janus Ni&#8208;MXene quantum dot (Ni&#8208;MJQD), a novel material architecture that exhibits high performance in supercapacitor and catalytic applications. A Ni&#8208;MJQD cathode delivers an impressive gravimetric specific capacity of 168.75 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and its Janus structure optimizes the balance between capacity and ion diffusion. In an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (AHSC) with a porous activated carbon (PAC) anode, it achieves an energy density of 54.22&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a power density of 1599&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and 88% capacity retention over 20&#160;000 cycles. As a catalyst, the Ni&#8208;MJQD also exhibits high activity in benzyl alcohol oxidation, reaching 95% conversion and 98.4% selectivity for benzaldehyde, with the largest turnover frequency of 8.8825 &#215; 10&#8722;3 moles g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as an oxidant. Mechanistic analysis reveals contributions from both radical and nonradical pathways. These findings emphasize the unique potential of the Ni&#8208;MJQD electrodes for sustainable energy storage and green synthesis applications.

         <title>3D Ordered Macroporous Superstructures of High Entropy Hydroxide with Strong Orbital Coupling Enhancing Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous high&#8208;entropy hydroxides enhances mass transfer and active sites exposure, and enhance local OH&#8722; concentration and electric field strength, and the strong coupling between atomic orbitals facilitates electron transfer and promotes electrical activity, which shows high durability and corrosion resistance in water/seawater electrolysis with high current density.








Abstract
The water splitting performance is strongly influenced by intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the accessibility of the active center. Herein, high&#8208;entropy hydroxides (HEH) with 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure are prepared by chemical etching method with rational design. The 3DOM structure can maximize the exposure of the active sites and also facilitates bubble transport. As demonstrated by finite element analysis, the 3DOM structure modifies the spatial curvature of the catalyst, resulting in the enrichment of OH&#8722;. Moreover, the strong orbital coupling of transition metals significantly regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst, selectively adsorbs OH&#8722; at Fe sites, and inhibits the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Thanks to these characteristics, 3DOM&#8208;HEH&#8208;300 shows the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1 m KOH (182 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 211 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), and stables operation of more than 400 h. Besides, in natural seawater, it also exhibits the best catalytic activity (245 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 278 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), which is better than similar catalysts without 3DOM structure. This work verifies the great synergistic effect of high entropy and mass transfer on the performance of OER, which also provides a new idea for constructing high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>Body&#8208;Coupled&#8208;Driven Object&#8208;Oriented Natural Interactive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;mode 2D/3D interaction is realized through body&#8208;coupled energy transfer, achieving 200 &#181;m&#8208;resolution 2D calligraphy reconstruction and 200 mm&#8208;range 3D tracking with sub&#8208;millisecond mode switching for seamless cross&#8208;dimensional control. Meanwhile, an object&#8208;oriented human machine interaction (HMI)&#160;framework is proposed to enable multi&#8208;device interoperability by detecting electromagnetic signatures, resolving device isolation through bioinspired face&#8208;to&#8208;face interaction adaptable to metaverse digital twins.








Abstract
The metaverse progressively demands heightened sophistication in human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine collaboration, accelerating development of hybrid immersive 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception interfaces. However, current interfaces struggle with the precision and adaptability in complex human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine interaction scenarios. This paper presents a transparent stretchable sensing interface synergizing 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception through body&#8208;coupled electromagnetic coupling. Its bi&#8208;modal coupling (resistive coupling and capacitive coupling) mechanism enables micrometer&#8208;scale 2D tactile sensing alongside broad 3D spatial perception (200&#160;mm range). The contact mode achieves calligraphy&#8208;grade trajectory reconstruction (200 &#181;m precision) with force tactile sensing, while the non&#8208;contact mode recognizes 38 gestures at 97.11% accuracy. The interface's mechanical transparency and elasticity permit seamless integration on curved surfaces (e.g., gloves and clothes) without perceptual interference. An object&#8208;oriented human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) framework is developed to enable single&#8208;interface control of multiple devices through electromagnetic signature recognition, enhancing collaborative efficiency. This work can inspire designs of smart interfaces in intelligent healthcare monitoring, industrial robotics coordination, and cross&#8208;domain augmented reality applications.

         <title>Microstructural Evolution Dynamics in Rapid Joule Heating Densification of High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of high&#8208;temperature rapid Joule heating combined with two&#8208;step sintering drives full densification while suppressing grain coarsening in high&#8208;Ni cathodes. By activating lattice and grain boundary diffusion over surface diffusion, this approach achieves dense microstructures without excessive grain growth, offering insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, and guiding the synthesis of fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy density materials are essential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which power a wide range of applications from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Among them, high&#8208;Nickel (Ni)&#160;layered oxide cathodes have emerged as promising candidates due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, pores and excessive grain growth in high&#8208;Ni layered oxides compromise energy density and mechanical integrity, while oversized grains hinder lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, necessitating a sintering strategy that promotes densification without inducing abnormal grain growth. Here, a rapid Joule heating technique combined with two&#8208;step sintering is introduced that significantly improves the microstructural integrity of high&#8208;Ni cathodes. This approach enables fast densification while suppressing grain growth, resulting in cathodes with higher density, reduced porosity, and enhanced mechanical strength. Through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and 3D ptychography analysis, it is found that the rapid Joule&#8208;heated cathodes exhibit mitigated phase separation, suppressed pore evolution, and improved resistance to crack propagation. They deliver superior cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, and rate performance. These results provide insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, offering guidelines for synthesizing fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.

         <title>Tailoring Solvation Structures via Precise Diluent Engineering for High&#8208;Rate 500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring solvation structures via precise diluent engineering, this electrolyte design enhances both energy density and rate capability for practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). As a result, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell with an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 retains &gt;92% of the initial capacity over 107 cycles at 0.2&#160;&#160;C charge/1 C discharge.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), featuring lithium metal anodes (LMAs) paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, are promising candidates for achieving energy densities exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1. However, their commercialization is hindered by unstable interphases and insufficient Li+ transport kinetics, especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a hybrid diluent strategy is reported for diluted high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (DHCEs) that decouples Li+ solvation from interfacial stabilization by combining fluorinated aromatics with fluorinated ethers. Fluorinated aromatics promote efficient Li+ desolvation and fast transport, while fluorinated ethers provide high oxidative stability and robust interphase formation. Their combination produces a synergistic solvation environment, simultaneously enhancing ion transport, extending voltage tolerance, and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The tailored electrolyte enables 0.78 Ah Li&#8208;NCM622 pouch cells to achieve over 300 cycles at 0.33C charge/0.66C discharge under practical conditions (Li: 50 &#181;m; NCM622: 20 mg cm&#8722;2; electrolyte: 3 g Ah&#8722;1). Furthermore, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell demonstrates an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 and retains over 92% of its initial capacity after 107 cycles at 0.2C charge/1C discharge. This work establishes a scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy that directly addresses the key failure mechanisms of LMBs, offering a viable pathway toward practical high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;rate applications.

         <title>Generalizable Porous Aromatic Framework&#8208;Included Polymer Membranes for Diffusion&#8208;Enhanced Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work contains a generalizable procedure for enhancing the gas permeability and aging resistance of polymer membranes without compromising selectivity by incorporating robust porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). The PAF fillers are highly dispersible in a wide range of solvents, and amine&#8208;functionalization of the PAF enhances the plasticization resistance of the mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.








Abstract
Industrial separation processes account for 10&#8211;15% of global energy consumption. Membrane&#8208;based processes are less energy&#8208;intensive than traditional gas separation technologies; however, enhanced material separation performance and stability for numerous gas mixtures are needed for widespread industrial adoption. This work presents a generalizable strategy for preparing mixed&#8208;matrix gas separation membranes exceeding the performance upper bounds of existing polymer membranes for a wide variety of industrial gases. By incorporating robust porous aromatic framework (PAF) particles into various dense commercial polymer matrices, gas diffusivity and solubility can be enhanced. For diverse gas mixtures (e.g., CO2/N2, O2/N2, He/CH4, H2/N2, and C2H4/C2H6), the resulting composite membranes exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities&#8212;by as much as 520%&#8212;and largely unchanged selectivities even after 6 years of aging under simulated flue gas conditions. These improvements arise from the ultrahigh porosity, excellent chemical compatibility, and unique physicochemical properties of the embedded PAF particles. Functionalizing the PAFs with polyamines also enables composite membranes that achieve among the highest reported performances against plasticization, a common obstacle in commercializing gas separation membranes. Significantly, the PAF&#8208;1 particles are readily dispersible in various common membrane casting solvents, suggesting their broader utility as a filler for designing high&#8208;performance membranes for many industrial gas separations.

         <title>Universal NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Emitting Unimolecular Micelles with Tailorable Pharmacokinetic and Optical Properties for Adaptive Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in optimizing the pharmacokinetics of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials by disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. Besides reducing nonspecific uptake, the blood circulation can be adjusted half&#8208;life over a 60&#8208;fold range and enhance the fluorescence emissions by unimolecular micelle designs, facilitating flexible imaging applications from detecting kidney dysfunction to identifying tumors.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated fluorophores show great potential for NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;imaging owing to their superior brightness and photostability, yet their clinical translation has been hindered by suboptimal pharmacokinetics. To address this issue, a strategy is developed to tailor the in vivo behavior of &#960;&#8208;conjugate fluorophores by breaking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. This approach marks a significant shift from traditional methods of tuning micelles, which rely on varying the hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic ratios and are often ineffective for &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems due to the dominance of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. By disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the unimolecular micelles, pharmacokinetics and photophysical properties can be precisely controlled by systematically varying the molecular weight and composition of the polymer brushes. Accordingly, the blood circulation half&#8208;life can be adjusted across a 60&#8208;fold range, and fluorescence emissions are improved by 47&#8208;fold, facilitating adaptive fluorophore applications from kidney dysfunction detection to tumor imaging. Additionally, the engineered unimolecular micelles exhibit reduced nonspecific uptake and improved tumor targeting efficiency, resulting in a 5&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratio than conventional &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked nano&#8208;aggregates. These findings offer a solid solution to the pharmacokinetic optimization issues and provide a new design principle for &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials.

These findings offer a solid solution to the pharmacokinetic optimization issues and provide a new design principle for &#960;-conjugated phototheranostic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Fe3+&#8208;Doped Dendritic Mesoporous Organosilica Nanocomposites as Ferroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>

The designed TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites, based on Fe&#8208;DMOS NPs as a novel ferroptosis inducer and cornerstone to deliver CaO2&#8208;HA NPs, which enable release Fe3+, Ca2+, and H2O2 rapidly in TME for the activation of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated ICD. With the assistance of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1, the long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immune response will be activated and effectively suppress the growth and metastasis of tumors.








Abstract
Dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) nanoparticles are widely used to transport therapeutic agents to cancer sites and rapidly release them owing to their rapid biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of these DMOS nanoparticles as nanocarriers is limited, and their applications remain relatively simple. In this study, Fe3+&#8208;doped dendritic mesoporous organosilica (Fe&#8208;DMOS) nanoparticles are designed as a new type of ferroptosis inducer and are combined with sodium hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide to form TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites. The nanocomposites can effectively generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction between the released Fe3+ and self&#8208;compensated hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial injury caused by Ca2+ overload further promotes this process. Both Fe3+ and disulfide bonds can induce glutathione depletion, thus downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 and triggering lethal levels of lipid peroxidation products, further facilitating ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the ferroptosis&#8208;mediated process of immunogenic cell death promotes a long&#8208;term antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis of tumor cells with the assistance of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1). Fe&#8208;DMOS nanoparticles are synthesized with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities and established TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor to effectively improve tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Weak Electrostatic Interaction of Polybenzimidazole&#8208;Based Membrane for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes with Lewis acid&#8208;modulated electronic structure enable high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries. By reducing electron density on benzimidazole rings, AlF3 weakens interactions between charge&#8208;balance ions and polymer, achieving enhanced ionic conductivity. The optimized membrane delivers a high power density of 1000 mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over cycles at 140 mA cm&#8722;2, offering a novel strategy for durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are one of the promising aqueous redox chemistries for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the energy efficiency (EE) and power density of batteries with low&#8208;cost polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes are still limited due to the relatively poor ionic conductivity of PBI in an alkaline medium. Here, this study proposes a novel chemical approach for regulating the chemical environment of the PBI membrane. Specifically, AlF3, as a representative Lewis acid, is employed to reduce the electron cloud density of the benzimidazole (BI) ring, weaken the electrostatic interactions between the BI ring and charge&#8208;balancing ions, and thereby accelerate the diffusion of charge&#8208;balancing ions. Characterizations on the AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes reveal that the enhanced ion transport can be ascribed to decreased electron cloud density of BI rings and reduced ion diffusion resistance. Charge density difference analysis further illustrates the electron&#8208;withdrawing feature of AlF3 as a Lewis acid. AZIFBs using AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane demonstrate excellent rate capability from 40 to 240 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE of more than 80%, and an outstanding power density of nearly 1000 mW cm&#8722;2. The battery also performs decent cycle stability of 500 cycles at a high current density of 140 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE over 80%, resulting from the robust stability of the AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane and the reliability of the strategy. This study highlights the potential of Lewis acid&#8208;based chemical regulation to optimize PBI&#8208;based membranes, offering a new perspective for enhancing the performance of AZIFBs.

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared all&#8208;optical modulated optoelectronic memristor is constructed by combining upconversion nanoparticles with ZnO. Under the ultraviolet (350 nm) and near&#8208;infrared (980 nm) light stimulation, the device exhibits bidirectional synaptic plasticity, encompassing both excitatory and inhibitory responses. A series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability and microscopic biological motion recognition is demonstrated here.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) synaptic devices are characterized by unique optical sensitivity and synaptic plasticity, possessing high potential to significantly broaden the visual spectrum accessible to humans. Moreover, these devices seamlessly integrate neuro&#8208;morphological computing with infrared optical communication, attracting significant attention for future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;efficiency neuromorphic visual systems. However, the irreversible optical response of most optical synapses under short&#8208;wavelength infrared light severely restricts the practical application of these devices. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a NIR optoelectronic memristor with all&#8208;optical modulation based on ZnO&#8208;upconversion nanoparticles (ZnO&#8208;UCNPs) nanocomposite film. The proposed device exhibits bidirectional light response characteristics under 350&#160;and 980&#160;nm light stimulations. The memristive mechanism can be attributed to the photothermal effect of upconversion nanoparticles in the nanocomposite film in conjunction with optical excitation in ZnO. Due to the all&#8208;optical plasticity, a series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability, including are demonstrated in the proposed synaptic device. In addition, by leveraging the tissue&#8208;penetrating capability of NIR light, the proposed device can be used in microscopic biological motion detection tasks and edge detection functions. This work introduces a promising method for developing fully optically controlled memristors and advancing the field of neuromorphic vision.

         <title>Anchoring Redox Mediator on COFs for Efficient Solar to Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Fe ions are first fixed on COFs skeleton to construct a novel 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction (BWO/Fe/TP1C). The cycling of Fe3+/Fe2+ significantly improves the electron transfer rate. In addition, the construction of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers but also ensures its high redox activity. As a result, 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which surpasses most COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
To address severe carrier recombination in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, redox mediators such as IO3&#8722;/I&#8722; or Fe3&#8314;/Fe2&#8314; are often introduced, yet their dispersion in solution causes instability, low electron transport efficiency and side reactions. Herein, an innovative Fe&#8208;coordinated 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF (TP1C) and Bi2WO6 (BWO) is developed for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Unlike traditional indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, the Fe3+/Fe2+ mediator is firmly anchored on the skeleton of COFs, thus enhancing recyclability, charge migration and long&#8208;lasting stability, which is supported by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and a range of electrochemical tests. In addition, the formation of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions not only retains high redox properties but also provides abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Consequently, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C reaches up to 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the addition of co&#8208;catalysts, being about 28.68 times as high as that of pure COFs and 2.3 folds over that of 25% BWO/TP1C, exceeding a host of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The findings of this research highlight the potential of novel indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for advanced photocatalytic applications, offering a new pathway to overcome the limitations of traditional COF&#8208;based systems in hydrogen production.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address severe carrier recombination in Z-scheme heterojunctions, redox mediators such as IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;I&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; are often introduced, yet their dispersion in solution causes instability, low electron transport efficiency and side reactions. Herein, an innovative Fe-coordinated 2D Z-scheme heterojunction composed of TpPa-1-COF (TP1C) and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (BWO) is developed for efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Unlike traditional indirect Z-scheme heterojunctions, the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mediator is firmly anchored on the skeleton of COFs, thus enhancing recyclability, charge migration and long-lasting stability, which is supported by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and a range of electrochemical tests. In addition, the formation of 2D Z-scheme heterojunctions not only retains high redox properties but also provides abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C reaches up to 6.31 mmol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the addition of co-catalysts, being about 28.68 times as high as that of pure COFs and 2.3 folds over that of 25% BWO/TP1C, exceeding a host of COF-based photocatalysts. The findings of this research highlight the potential of novel indirect Z-scheme heterojunctions for advanced photocatalytic applications, offering a new pathway to overcome the limitations of traditional COF-based systems in hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Brightness NIR&#8208;II Emission: Molecular Locking and Wrapping Strategies in Fluorescent Material Design for in Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a molecular design strategy for bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores by addressing fluorescence quenching and low absorption in aggregates. Through structural optimization of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor small molecules (DTTD, DMTTD, DETTD), high NIR&#8208;II brightness is achieved. DETTD nanoparticles enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging, establishing a general paradigm for enhancing NIR&#8208;II fluorescence performance.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging has transformed biomedical imaging by providing low autofluorescence, deep tissue penetration, and superior spatial resolution, essential for precise in vivo biological visualization. However, developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting molecular fluorophores with high brightness remains challenging due to the difficulty in simultaneously achieving high absorption coefficients and excellent fluorescence emission in aggregated states. This study addresses these challenges at both the molecular and aggregate levels through a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) configured small molecules. The initial twisted molecule, DTTD, exhibits low absorption and significant fluorescence quenching upon aggregation. To mitigate these issues, DMTTD is synthesized with a planarized backbone by locking the &#960; bridge with the phenylene ring of donor, resulting in a higher absorption coefficient and reduced quenching due to its rigid structure and bulky donors. Further enhancement is achieved by incorporating branched alkyl chains into DMTTD for wrapping the molecular skeleton, creating DETTD, which maintains a high absorption coefficient and improved resistance to quenching in aggregated states. DETTD nanoparticles (NPs) with high NIR&#8208;II brightness of 117.5&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 enabled high&#8208;resolution imaging of mice vasculature and gastrointestinal tract. This study establishes a general paradigm for simultaneously mitigating fluorescence quenching and improving absorption coefficients to achieve bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

         <title>Dynamic Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Equilibrium Enables Unprecedented HER Stability in Acidic PEMWE</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen energy is key to achieving carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) enables efficient green hydrogen production but faces catalyst instability issues. This work introduces a low&#8208;platinum catalyst with a dynamic equilibrium mechanism, balancing durability and activity. The catalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade stability (&gt;2&#160;200&#160;h) and high performance, offering a scalable solution for cost&#8208;effective, durable electrolyzers and advancing renewable energy storage.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds substantial promise for effectively utilizing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. However, it faces critical durability challenges due to acid&#8208;driven catalyst degradation under intermittent renewable power. Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution&#8208;deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual&#8208;functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt3(FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2, 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self&#8208;adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&gt;2200&#160;h @1 A cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles). The self&#8208;supported catalysts can be easily mass&#8208;produced with 8.87&#160;wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium&#8208;driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Perovskite Planar Detectors Surpass CdZnTe in High&#8208;Energy Gamma&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CZT and CsPbBr3 differ primarily in charge transport. CZT's much lower hole &#181;&#964; leads to charge trapping and broader high&#8208;energy peaks. In contrast, CsPbBr3 has balanced electron and hole &#181;&#964; products, reducing trapping and producing sharper photopeaks. As a result, planar detectors of CsPbBr3 deliver superior spectral resolution above 500&#160;keV.








Abstract
The detection of high&#8208;energy gamma radiation (&gt;1 MeV) at room temperature requires large&#8208;volume semiconductor crystals with high absorption efficiency, charge transport properties, and stability. The CsPbBr3 perovskite is a promising candidate due to its congruent melting growth, high defect tolerance, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. In this study, the performance of CsPbBr3 is evaluated as a gamma&#8208;ray detector across a wide energy range and up to 1332 keV and compare its efficacy to commercial CdZnTe (CZT) detectors of similar crystal thickness. The CsPbBr3 detectors demonstrate high energy resolution, superior spectral fidelity for high&#8208;energy gamma peaks (&gt;1 MeV), and long&#8208;term operational stability over 225 days without performance loss. Notably, CsPbBr3 resolves closely spaced gamma lines with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, including weak emissions from depleted uranium sources. Its more balanced charge transport compared to CZT minimizes signal distortion, even in thick detectors, and enables precise spectral peak definition without complex correction algorithms. Comparative measurements on planar detectors demonstrate that CsPbBr3 achieves comparable energy resolution to CZT at energies &lt;0.5 MeV and outperforms at high energies, making it a strong alternative for next&#8208;generation radiation detection applications.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired MXene Electrode with the Highly Interconnected Gradient Nanoconfined Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a bamboo&#8208;inspired gradient nanoconfined MXene (GNC&#8208;MX) electrode is designed. Combining the multiscale architecture, in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation for tunable interlayer channels, and scalable group&#8208;welding strategies, the thick GNC&#8208;MX electrodes achieved an ultra&#8208;high area&#8208;specific capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, which surpassing conventional MXene systems and validating the potential of gradient&#8208;confined architectures in practical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving efficient ion transport in thick electrodes remains a fundamental challenge in electrochemical systems with high energy density, primarily due to prolonged diffusion pathways and poorly integrated architectures. Leveraging the nanoconfinement effect, (sub)nanoscale channels can significantly accelerate ion transport kinetics to maximize electrochemical performance. Inspired by the hierarchical network structure of bamboo membrane, a gradient nanoconfined MXene electrode (GNC&#8208;MX) is designed, where multiscale interlayer spacing is coupled with in&#8208;plane mesopores that bridge adjacent nanoconfined channels, enabling synergistic vertical and horizontal ion migration. Finite element simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic optimization mechanism of ion transport via the gradient nanoconfined channels and in&#8208;plane mesopores. Compared to pristine MXene, GNC&#8208;MX electrodes exhibit substantially enhanced ion transport kinetics and charge storage performance. To optimize the nanoconfined channels, an in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation strategy is introduced to strengthen electrostatic repulsion and weaken hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the MXene interlayer, enabling quasi&#8208;permanent expansion of ion transport channels. Furthermore, a scalable group&#8208;welding method is developed to fabricate 400 &#181;m&#8208;thick electrodes with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, surpassing current MXene&#8208;based electrodes. This work provides a scalable and tunable biomimetic platform for advanced ion nanoconfinement in energy storage systems.

Leveraging the nanoconfinement effect, (sub)nanoscale channels can significantly accelerate ion transport kinetics to maximize electrochemical performance. Inspired by the hierarchical network structure of bamboo membrane, a gradient nanoconfined MXene electrode (GNC-MX) is designed, where multiscale interlayer spacing is coupled with in-plane mesopores that bridge adjacent nanoconfined channels, enabling synergistic vertical and horizontal ion migration. Finite element simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic optimization mechanism of ion transport via the gradient nanoconfined channels and in-plane mesopores. Compared to pristine MXene, GNC-MX electrodes exhibit substantially enhanced ion transport kinetics and charge storage performance. To optimize the nanoconfined channels, an in situ deprotonation-reprotonation strategy is introduced to strengthen electrostatic repulsion and weaken hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the MXene interlayer, enabling quasi-permanent expansion of ion transport channels. Furthermore, a scalable group-welding method is developed to fabricate 400 &#181;m-thick electrodes with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 20.7 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing current MXene-based electrodes. This work provides a scalable and tunable biomimetic platform for advanced ion nanoconfinement in energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional High&#8208;Entropy Oxide with Inner Metallic Coordination and Surface Medium&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;OH for Durable PEM Water Electrolysis at 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2</title>

An unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide prepared by a reduction&#8208;oxidation method with inner metallic coordination and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH realizes durable PEM water electrolysis at 2 A cm&#8722;2 for over 1500 h.








Abstract
The multicomponent synergistic effect has become increasingly important for electrocatalysis; however, there remain large unexplored compositional and structural spaces. Here, an unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) with inner metallic coordination interactions and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH for durable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) is presented. The metallic clusters inside the HEO particles generate the inner metallic coordination interactions that reserve electrons, with a multicomponent effect, to inhibit Ru/Ir overoxidation and switch reaction mechanisms toward an exclusive adsorbate evolution mechanism for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH groups enable adaptive interfacial water networks to trap reactive water and promote proton transfer, reducing mass transport resistance at large current densities. Resultantly, this RuIrNiCoCrO2&#8208;incorporated PEMWEs achieve the ultralow voltages of 1.71 V@2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 2.03 V@5.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 80&#160;&#176;C, and unprecedented durability &gt;1500 h@2.0 A cm&#8722;2. Thus, the dual engineering of inner multicomponent coordination environments and surface functional groups overcomes the activity&#8208;stability dilemma in the PEMWEs.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence of ZnS Under Easily Tailored Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored phase transitions reveal key insights into the mechanoluminescent mechanisms of Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS. A reversible wt&#8208;ZnS &#8596; sp&#8208;ZnS phase transition is achieved through low&#8208;pressure pressing and thermal annealing. Screw dislocation movement drives the phase transition and mediates enhanced mechanoluminescece in ZnS:Mn and suppressed emission in ZnS:Cu. This work provides a foundation for designing next&#8208;generation luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS has emerged as a highly promising self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescent (ML) materials with significant potential in intelligent sensing, dynamic displays, and artificial intelligence. However, the exact ML mechanism remains elusive, and the energy transfer processes governed by complex interactions remain unknown. This study finds dislocation&#8208;mediated ML enhancement in ZnS:Mn and ML suppression in ZnS:Cu under easily tailored the phase transition. By precisely increasing uniaxial machine pressure (0&#8211;30&#160;MPa), the study achieves for the first time a gradual phase transition from hexagonal wurtzite (wt&#8208;ZnS) to cubic sphalerite (sp&#8208;ZnS) at room temperature, which can be reversibly tuned through thermal annealing. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that screw dislocation slip under uniaxial pressure induces sp&#8208;ZnS stacking faults within the wt&#8208;ZnS lattice, with fault density dependent on pressure and dopant concentration. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that the phase transition enhances ML emission but suppresses photoluminescence (PL) in ZnS:Mn, reflecting distinct dislocation&#8208;mediated energy transfer behaviors in ML and PL processes. This work establishes a powerful strategy for controllable phase transition engineering to tailor and enhance the ML properties, provides fundamental insights into the ML mechanisms, and offers a practical design strategy for the development of advanced luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Additive Discovery with HOMO&#8208;Descriptor Enables Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries via Interfacial Kinetics Engineering</title>

A machine learning&#8208;guided strategy identifies 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an effective electrolyte additive for aqueous Zn batteries. By regulating interfacial kinetics and suppressing side reactions, DMAP enables uniform Zn deposition and exceptional cycling stability. This study offers a data&#8208;driven approach to interfacial engineering for durable and scalable aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Dendritic growth and parasitic reactions severely hinder aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to interfacial instability and uncontrolled charge transfer. Here, a machine learning&#8208;accelerated strategy for rational additive screening, establishing a predictive framework that links the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to the adsorption and reduction behavior of Zn2+, is reported. An interpretable machine learning model (Adaptive Boosting), trained on a curated molecular dataset, achieves high accuracy (Mean Squared Error = 0.2977, Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.8032) in HOMO prediction. Guided by this model, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine is identified as a high&#8208;performance additive, which can suppress Zn dendrite formation by slowing interfacial charge transfer and mitigating local ion starvation through kinetic matching between mass transport and deposition. Moreover, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine effectively excludes interfacial H2O molecules, significantly inhibiting parasitic reactions. Consequently, Zn anode delivers high reversibility of plating/stripping with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.85% over 1600 cycles. The 0.3&#8208;Ah NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O|Zn pouch cell delivers stable cyclability for 70 days, with a capacity retention of 73% after 250 cycles. This work pioneers the integration of machine learning with interfacial electrochemistry, offering a generalizable approach for additive discovery and electrolyte design, and sets a new paradigm for achieving dendrite&#8208;free metallic anodes in aqueous systems.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Engineered Carbon Scaffold for Interface&#8208;First Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

An all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber symmetric architecture based on oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fibers enables dual&#8208;interface regulation, uniformly plating Na at the anode while anchoring and catalyzing polysulfides at the cathode, effectively eliminating dendrite formation and shuttle migration for long&#8208;life, high&#8208;rate room&#8208;temperature Na&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries offer high theoretical energy density (1274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and low&#8208;cost, abundant materials, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, commercialization is hindered by multiple challenges: polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics at the cathode, coupled with dendrite growth and interfacial failure at the anode. Here, an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (OCF) framework is designed and employed as a bifunctional host within a symmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber cell architecture to simultaneously address these issues. The 3D porous OCF framework chemically anchors polysulfides, catalyzes their redox reactions, and guides uniform sodium nucleation/deposition. This synergy suppresses polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth. Performance tests demonstrate an extremely low Na nucleation overpotential (27&#160;mV at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and stable, dendrite&#8208;free cycling exceeding 3600 h. In full Na&#9472;S cells, this design delivers a specific capacity of 753 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, retains &#8776;85% capacity after 2000 cycles at 0.5 C, and exhibits excellent rate performance (5 C). Mechanistic studies reveal OCF enhances Na&#8314; transport and interfacial kinetic stability. This work presents a generalizable, interface&#8208;first design paradigm for safe, long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;cost Na&#9472;S batteries free from shuttling and dendrites.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy/Intermetallic Compound Heterostructures for Efficient Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a bicontinuous nanoporous architecture as bifunctional electrocatalyst is constructed by a facile and scalable alloying/dealloying approach for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolysis. It exhibits exceptional activities and durability by virtue of strain engineering of multicomponent intermetallic compound core, which enables high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface with multiple active centres for *N2Hx intermediate spillover to lower kinetic barriers.








Abstract
Configuring integrative catalytic heterostructures is an efficient strategy to circumvent the universal linear scaling relationships for accelerating multiple&#8208;intermediate redox reactions. Here this study reports nonprecious metal&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a 3D nanoporous architecture as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction. By making use of strain engineering of hexagonal close&#8208;packed multicomponent intermetallic compound core, high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface is comprised of multiple active centers with undulatory adsorption energies, which enable *N2Hx intermediate spillover to adjust rate&#8208;determining step and lower kinetic barriers. As a consequence of nanoporous architecture endowing abundant multiple active surfaces, this heterostructure mediates hydrazine electrooxidation of as high as ampere&#8208;level current densities at &gt;0.08&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, showing genuine potential to replace sluggish oxygen evolution reaction for hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Its hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyser delivers 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at ultralow cell voltage of 0.87&#160;V, and maintains exceptional stability for 1000 h.

         <title>Pd Single&#8208;Atoms Doped Cu3P Quantum Dots with Moderately Optimized H* Sorption Behaviors for Actualizing the Multifunctional &#8220;Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; Galvanic System</title>

Pd single&#8208;atoms doped Cu3P quantum dots effectively drive the novel multifunctional &#8220;formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate&#8221; galvanic system for wastes purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3, H2, and formate simultaneously, leveraging the green environment and promising clean energy for a sustainable future.








Abstract
Nitrate and formaldehyde, which are substantial wastes in industrial and agricultural effluents, pose significant hazards to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies remain great challenges due to the unsatisfactory energy&#8208;intensive, time&#8208;consuming and noticeably costly reasons. Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalysts of Pd single&#8208;atoms doped Cu3P quantum dots (Pd&#8208;Cu3P SA&#8208;QDs) are reported to moderately optimize the H* sorption behaviors for accelerating the kinetics of nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and formaldehyde oxidation (FOR) reactions in a dual&#8208;directional way, thus realizing the high activity and selectivity for both cathodic ammonia (NH3) synthesis and anodic H2 production concurrently. Specifically, a very positive onset potential of +0.36 V (versus RHE) is recorded for NO3RR with a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99 % for NH3 at &#8722;0.3V (versus RHE), while the FOR can be initialized at a very low onset potential of &#8722;0.07 V (versus RHE) with &gt; 90 % FE for formate and &gt; 95 % FE for H2 at 0.3 V (versus RHE). Notably, a self&#8208;powered galvanic system can be triggered by integrating the above two electrode&#8208;based reactions, thus exhibiting an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.892 V, a peak power density of 12.1 mW cm&#8722;2, and capable of generating 8.8 KWh kg&#8722;1 of electrical energy.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Ionic Liquid Structured Polymer Electrolytes with Multi&#8208;Channel Ion Transport Pathways for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the wide&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries, a novel PEO&#8208;based electrolyte is developed. This electrolyte incorporates amino&#8208;functionalized MOF nanoparticles, encapsulated with ionic liquids (ILs) and dispersed within a PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membrane. The MOFs facilitate rapid Li+ interfacial hopping, while the encapsulated ILs improve bulk&#8208;phase transport. Together, these components establish a multi&#8208;channel conduction pathway ensuring both high Li+ conductivity and robust structural stability across a broad temperature range (&#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) enhanced with ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering advantages in interfacial compatibility and processability. However, their application across a broad temperature range has been hindered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. To overcome this limitation, the study designs an innovative poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPE architecture to decouple these properties. This architecture utilizes amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles to encapsulate and immobilize ILs within PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membranes, establishing stable multi&#8208;channel ion pathways across wide temperatures. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the functionalized MOF enables fast Li&#8314; hopping at interfaces, and the MOF&#8208;confined IL boosts bulk ion transport. This multi&#8208;path mechanism ensures high Li&#8314; conductivity and structural stability from &#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized CPE facilitates the formation of a LiF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase and an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase, significantly enhancing interfacial stability. Consequently, LiFePO4||Li cells exhibit excellent cyclability, retaining 96.8% capacity after 1000 cycles at 3 C, and demonstrate stable operation for over 400 cycles at both &#8722;10 and 120&#160;&#176;C. These results establish a novel strategy for decoupling the intrinsic compromise between mechanical and electrochemical performance in CPEs.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Polyoxometalate Composites in Neutral pH Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Stable Organic Solar Cells via Mutual Doping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N))&#160;enable ultrahigh doping densities through distinct pathways: PMA&#8208;initiated polymerization yields PDA&#8208;PMA with&#160;organic/inorganic mutual doping, while ammonia&#8208;neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) shifts to&#160;organic&#8208;dominated doping&#160;via structural rearrangement. The neutral&#8208;pH PDA&#8208;PMA(N) eliminates energy barriers by enabling&#160;quantum tunneling, delivering&#160;OSCs with record 20.29% efficiency&#160;and&#160;exceptional stability, surpassing PEDOT:PSS.








Abstract
Heavy doping critically minimizes depletion region widths for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells (OSCs), yet systematic studies elucidating its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. To address this, two polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N)) are designed via innovative mutual doping pathways. PDA&#8208;PMA achieved ultrahigh doping density (1.17 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) through H3[P(Mo3O10)4] (PMA) initiated oxidative polymerization of dopamine, where electron transfer simultaneously induced p&#8208;doped PDA and n&#8208;doped PMA. Remarkably, neutralization with ammonia yielded PDA&#8208;PMA(N), which retained even higher doping density (3.74 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) via structural rearrangement&#8208;driven organic doping. XPS/ESR studies revealed distinct pathways: dual organic/inorganic doping in PDA&#8208;PMA versus organic&#8208;dominated doping in PDA&#8208;PMA(N). This deep doping compressed depletion region widths from 44.42&#160;nm in undoped controls (the blend of PDA and PMA) to 0.052&#160;nm (PDA&#8208;PMA(N)), surpassing PEDOT:PSS (0.238&#160;nm) and enabling barrier&#8208;free hole transport. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs with PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N) achieved exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.02% and 20.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) demonstrated superior stability (86.2% PCE retention after 1800&#160;h illumination) by suppressing interfacial corrosion. This work elucidates structure&#8208;dependent doping mechanisms and provides a universal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hole transport layers through tailored doping, advancing OSC commercialization.

&lt;p&gt;Polydopamine-polyoxometalate composites (PDA-PMA and PDA-PMA(N))&#160;enable ultrahigh doping densities through distinct pathways: PMA-initiated polymerization yields PDA-PMA with&#160;organic/inorganic mutual doping, while ammonia-neutralized PDA-PMA(N) shifts to&#160;organic-dominated doping&#160;via structural rearrangement. The neutral-pH PDA-PMA(N) eliminates energy barriers by enabling&#160;quantum tunneling, delivering&#160;OSCs with record 20.29% efficiency&#160;and&#160;exceptional stability, surpassing PEDOT:PSS.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy doping critically minimizes depletion region widths for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells (OSCs), yet systematic studies elucidating its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. To address this, two polydopamine-polyoxometalate composites (PDA-PMA and PDA-PMA(N)) are designed via innovative mutual doping pathways. PDA-PMA achieved ultrahigh doping density (1.17 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) through H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[P(Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (PMA) initiated oxidative polymerization of dopamine, where electron transfer simultaneously induced p-doped PDA and n-doped PMA. Remarkably, neutralization with ammonia yielded PDA-PMA(N), which retained even higher doping density (3.74 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) via structural rearrangement-driven organic doping. XPS/ESR studies revealed distinct pathways: dual organic/inorganic doping in PDA-PMA versus organic-dominated doping in PDA-PMA(N). This deep doping compressed depletion region widths from 44.42&#160;nm in undoped controls (the blend of PDA and PMA) to 0.052&#160;nm (PDA-PMA(N)), surpassing PEDOT:PSS (0.238&#160;nm) and enabling barrier-free hole transport. Consequently, PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9-based OSCs with PDA-PMA and PDA-PMA(N) achieved exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.02% and 20.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the neutralized PDA-PMA(N) demonstrated superior stability (86.2% PCE retention after 1800&#160;h illumination) by suppressing interfacial corrosion. This work elucidates structure-dependent doping mechanisms and provides a universal strategy for developing high-performance hole transport layers through tailored doping, advancing OSC commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced High Entropy Effect for Optimized Electrolyte Design of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy effect has been demonstrated for electrolyte design. The proposed small&#8208;sized system exhibits higher entropy and increased configurational diversity, leading to smaller Li&#8314; solvation clusters and enhanced cluster mobility. As a result, Li&#8314; conductivity, the de&#8208;solvation process, and the interfacial layer configuration are optimized, endowing lithium&#8208;ion batteries with exceptional fast&#8208;charging/discharging capability and superior low&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte design is critical for high energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) but is struggling with the trade&#8208;offs between conductivity and stability. Increasing electrolyte entropy can improve the conductivity without compromising stability. A size&#8208;induced high entropy effect is identified for electrolyte design, which increases configurational entropy and is more pronounced than conventional number&#8208;induced high entropy effect. The developed size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) with small&#8208;sized esters exhibits enhanced configurational diversity and entropy, resulting in smaller Li+ solvation clusters, a lower freezing point (&#8722;96.6 &#176;C), threefold higher ionic conductivity at &#8722;60 &#176;C, improved wettability and facilitated Li+ de&#8208;solvation compared to conventional number&#8208;induced HEE. These advantages contribute to more uniform Li deposition and the formation of a robust and thin cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). Consequently, Li || NCM811 employing the small&#8208;sized HEE (SHEE) demonstrates superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles at a decay rate of 0.0162%/cycle under 10 C, and an exceptional rate capability under ultralow temperatures, i.e., capacity retention of 84.3% at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. A 1.0 Ah graphite || NCM811 pouch cell further exhibits 97.7% capacity retention for 300 cycles. The size&#8208;induced high entropy design strategy of electrolyte promises practical operation of LIBs under extreme conditions.

         <title>Characterizing Emerging Detector Materials for Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray medical imaging requires detectors that deliver images at as low as reasonably possible dose. This perspective outlines a universal characterization framework of X&#8208;ray imaging detectors, suitable for both emerging semiconductor and scintillator materials, introduces a novel unified figure of merit that links dose with resolution, and offers an open&#8208;access calculator, enabling fair benchmarking of detector prototypes at early technology&#8208;readiness levels.








Abstract
Modern clinical diagnostics significantly rely on X&#8208;ray medical imaging detectors, which play a key role in obtaining high&#8208;quality images while ensuring patient radiation exposure adheres to the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; principle. The last decade has seen a renewed exploration of promising materials for X&#8208;ray detection, foremost focusing on lead&#8208;based perovskites and other metal halides as direct&#8208;conversion semiconductors and scintillators. However, the reported performance characteristics, particularly X&#8208;ray sensitivity and the limit of dose rate detection, are often incomplete or misleading for assessing the practical utility of materials. This perspective surveys various approaches to the X&#8208;ray detector characterization of emerging materials, specifically focusing on Detective Quantum Efficiency within the context of low&#8208;dose medical imaging applications. Guidelines are provided for choosing, estimating, and presenting the relevant figures of merit, encompassing Detection Efficiency, Noise Equivalent Dose, response time, and spatial resolution, accompanied by ready&#8208;to&#8208;use computational tools, including a MATLAB application, a Mathcad worksheet, and an interactive website.

         <title>Interface Engineering and Optimization Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Polymer Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the interface challenges of composite polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries are delved into, innovative improvement strategies are explored, and their future industrialization is envisioned. By offering comprehensive insights, it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the energy storage domain.








Abstract
Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high&#8208;voltage or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high&#8208;energy&#8208;density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues. Moreover, the insights presented here provide valuable guidance for the industrial&#8208;scale production of PCEs, helping to bridge the gap between laboratory innovations and practical applications.

         <title>Advances in &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing Materials: Molecular Design and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Failure Mechanisms and Practical Optimizations for Ah&#8208;Scale Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a comparative dissection of coin cells versus pouch cells is systematically conducted, identifying key challenges when scale&#8208;up. Furthermore, the multiscale failure mechanisms in pouch cells are deeply analyzed. Based on these insights, the practicality&#8208;oriented strategies are proposed to address the practical demands of Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a key technology for the safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. While the research on coin cells has achieved significant advancements, the failure mechanisms and design strategies of pouch cells that hold great practical potentiality, remain relatively underexplored. This review aims to fill this gap via providing an in&#8208;depth exploration of the failure mechanisms and practical optimizations of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells. A comparative analysis between coin cells and pouch cells is conducted in terms of the research status, bridging principles, and configuration&#8208;specific distinctions. Further interpretation of failure mechanisms at both electrodes and device is systematically discussed; these include the instability associated with cathode and anode, and the device&#8208;scale failures such as current collector and binder degradation, interfacial mismatch, and packaging&#8208;induced defects. The practicality&#8208;oriented strategies for Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells are further proposed. The final section advocates that future research should emphasize high&#8208;loading and large&#8208;area design, enhancement of kinetic performance, and tolerance to extreme operating conditions. This review contributes the theoretical insight and practical guidance to Ah&#8208;scale aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cell technologies, which are expected to promote their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems.

A &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr&#8208;BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO2 adsorption capacity, exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non&#8208;crosslinked alkylamines amines.








Abstract
This study introduces a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr&#8208;BDC (also MIL&#8208;101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF&#8208;polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO2 capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr&#8208;BDC&#8208;TAEA&#8208;BDE (branched&#8208;linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO2 capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO2/N2 selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N2/CO2 separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the four MOF&#8208;polymer composites are subjected to up to 100 temperature swing adsorption/desorption&#160;cycles (at 313 and 393 K, respectively), revealing minimal amine leaching or degradation over time. Notably, the composites also show significantly enhanced cyclability compared to Cr&#8208;BDC impregnated with amines without epoxide crosslinking agents; this indicates that crosslinking inhibits amine leaching.

         <title>A Generalizable Fluorescence Sensor Platform for Sample Preparation&#8208;Free Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular fluorescence sensor platform enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes in complex samples. The design uses HaloTag to tether a fluorogenic dye to a nanobody, where target binding promotes dye activation and fluorescence. This generalizable system achieves picomolar sensitivity across diverse targets and offers a simple, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play format for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.








Abstract
Modern molecular detection assays such as enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer excellent sensitivity and specificity, but typically require multiple reagents and extensive sample preparation, limiting their usefulness as rapid diagnostics. A generalizable biosensor platform is introduced that enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes with high sensitivity in complex samples. The NanoFluor system employs Janelia Fluor dyes coupled to a nanobody via HaloTag conjugation with a flexible glycine&#8208;serine linker, where the dye undergoes a switch from a non&#8208;fluorescent to a fluorescent state when the coupled nanobody binds to its target. It is demonstrated that the NanoFluor design achieves detection limits as low as picomolar concentrations across diverse protein targets. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computational models, reveal the mechanistic basis for the fluorescence change, and demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexed detection in complex samples including undiluted serum. This versatile, simple biosensor design can prove valuable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics and other molecular detection applications.

         <title>Robust Hydrogel Sensors Induced by Intermolecular Mechanical Interlocking of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Non&#8208;Invasive Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust hydrogel sensors have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and polyacrylamide; the intermolecular mechanical interlocking promotes energy dissipation and ion transport, resulting in superior strength, high toughness, and high ionic conductivity, holding great promise for non&#8208;invasive health monitoring.








Abstract
The compromise of tensile strength and toughness is essential for conductive hydrogels to enhance their cycling stability and mechanical durability in wearable strain sensors. It is effective but challenging to balance energy dissipation. Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non&#8208;covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&#8722;3 and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non&#8208;invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Monolayer p&#8208;Type Semiconductor Films Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrical Device Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
Tunable nucleation growth of large&#8208;area monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductor films is achieved by controlling the precursor evaporation area via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The device array fabricated with as&#8208;grown monolayer film exhibits high electrical performance of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 mobilities and &#8776;108 on/off ratio, exhibiting competitive electrical performance compared with most of the reported TMDC&#8208;based transistors.








Abstract
2D semiconductors open new avenues in the post&#8208;Moore era for semiconductor technologies immune from the short&#8208;channel effect due to their atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses and dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces. However, it still remains a big challenge to obtain large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductors so far. Herein, a controlled nucleation is realized by tuning the evaporation areas of Se precursors during the p&#8208;type WSe2 growth. By optimizing the nucleation density, centimeter&#8208;scale uniform monolayer WSe2 and Nb&#8208;incorporated WSe2 films are synthesized. The field effect transistor array based on WSe2 film exhibits p&#8208;type behavior with hole mobilities of 34&#160;&#177;&#160;17&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and an average on/off ratio of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;107, which can be further improved by Nb incorporation with much higher hole mobility of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with an average on/off ratio of &#8776;108. The work paves the way for synthesizing large&#8208;scale uniform 2D p&#8208;type semiconductors for electrical devices and integrated circuits.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are utilized in applications ranging from soft robotics to conductive inks, owing to their physical properties providing distinct mechanical, electrical, and thermal advantages. This work uses classical material science techniques to characterize ferroelectric polarization in supercooled liquid gallium and utilizes second harmonic generation imaging for further perturbation analysis.








Abstract
Polar metals are very rare and challenging to realize due to the incompatibility of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Mobile electrons in polar metals effectively screen the static electric field and dipoles. Recent studies show that 2D van der Waals metals without an inversion center can have polar order due to specific layer stacking. However, room temperature reversible ferroelectricity and nonlinear second harmonic generation in non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar metals remain unrealized. Here, the experimental realization of AB&#8208;stacked gallenene (a100) nanocrystals with a room temperature ferroelectric polarization in a liquid gallium environment is reported. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) due to a broken symmetry in multilayer gallenene structures, resulting in P1 (space group) and C1 (point group) symmetry is explained. The reversible polarization switching is characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy. This results demonstrate the reversible nonlinear optical response of the AB&#8208;stacked gallenene crystal through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The intensities of SHG signals are controlled via angular rotations and thermal heating, which indicate a phase transition at high temperatures. Furthermore, electrical perturbation enables the tunability of SHG intensity. Bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated in a two&#8208;terminal device. These findings open avenues for advancements in 2D ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and topological superconductivity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Rectification via Dynamic Phase Transitions in the Weyl Metallic State of ZrTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite preserving inversion symmetry, ZrTe5 exhibits rectification and high harmonic generation through a current&#8208;driven dynamic phase transition. This symmetry&#8208;breaking bifurcation enables forbidden nonlinear responses, unveiling a new regime of topological transport. The work establishes ZrTe5 as a benchmark platform for studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, with broad implications for terahertz technologies, energy harvesting, and next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Weyl metals, known for their topological structure and chiral anomaly, exhibit nonlinear transport that defies conventional theory. In this study, ZrTe5, an inversion&#8208;symmetric Dirac semimetal tunable to a Weyl state by magnetic field, is investigated, and rectification (alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) conversion) and third harmonic generation in longitudinal configurations is revealed. Despite its bulk inversion symmetry, symmetry&#8208;forbidden rectification and a dynamic phase transition arising from the chiral anomaly are observed. Rectification shows threshold behavior at a critical current density (&#119869;&#119888;) and temperature (&#119879;* &#8776; 30 K), while third&#8208;harmonic generation remains threshold&#8208;free. In transverse setups, even harmonics up to sixth order and a DC response, also symmetry&#8208;forbidden and threshold&#8208;sensitive, are detected. These results highlight the role of topology and dynamic symmetry breaking in enabling nonlinear responses and establish ZrTe5 as a model for terahertz and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on&#8208;Demand Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic&#8208;to&#8208;deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on&#8208;demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.








Abstract
An on&#8208;demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware&#8208;based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on&#8208;demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi&#8208;modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Regulated Interface Chemistry Enables Depolarization for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic&#8208;scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO2 surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H2O scavenging, and constructing a cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si&#8208;based components and polymers with enhanced Li+ conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO2 cathode to achieve a ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4.55 V.








Abstract
Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut&#8208;off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H2O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li+ diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long&#8208;term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo&#8208;mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon&#8208;containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1&#8208;3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.

This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long-term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo-mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon-containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1-3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome (kgm) topology are synthesized using imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) as the template. DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water, especially 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively. This work provides a rational strategy for the construction of COFs to enhance the photocatalytic HER.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as prominent photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the exquisite design of linkage and topological structures is crucial for efficient charge generation, separation, and transfer in the planar periodic framework. Here, an imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) is presented as a template for topology&#8208;templated synthesis of two 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome lattice to boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The fully conjugated DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is highly luminescent and exhibits topology&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;electron transmission and charge carrier mobility. Significantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real&#8208;world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF strengthens donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;&#8208;conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Subnanosecond Field&#8208;Free Switching of a Wafer&#8208;Scalable van der Waals Ferromagnet at Room Temperature</title>

Du et&#160;al. demonstrate field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit torque switching down to 0.8 ns in wafer&#8208;scale van der Waals ferromagnet/Pt heterostructures.

Abstract
Electrical manipulation of magnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) holds promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Investigating field&#8208;free, ultrafast switching at room temperature in wafer&#8208;scalable vdW heterostructures can advance the development of faster memories and enhance the understanding of magnetization switching mechanisms in 2D FMs. In this study, field&#8208;free, room temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching at subnanosecond timescales in a wafer&#8208;scalable Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructure by epitaxial growth engineering is demonstrated. The introduction of a variable concentration gradient of Fe is used to establish the coexistence of in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) within the ferromagnetic layer. The field&#8208;free switching, driven by the SOT from Pt, is achieved by using the IMA component to break the in&#8208;plane symmetry during the switching process. This work paves the way for the integration of efficient 2D vdW materials in advanced spintronic devices and faster memory technologies.

         <dc:description>
Organic heterostructures of polycationic chains and anions and semiconducting polymers form artificial synapses that update their synaptic weights via anion redistribution under electrical stimulation. Memory effects depend on anion species, enabling synaptic plasticity modulation. Continuously programmable nonvolatile conductance states are utilized to emulate a neural network, achieving handwritten digit and fashion image recognitions with high accuracies by using only 16 discrete device states.








Abstract
An organic heterostructure, composed of an ionoelastomer that comprises polycationic chains and mobile anions, and a semiconducting polymer, forms a new class of artificial synapses. These ionoelastomer synapses update their synaptic weights by modifying device conductance through the spatial redistribution of anions in response to electrical stimuli. The memory effect of these synapses is highly dependent on the specific anion species present, providing a unique means to modulate synaptic plasticity simply through anion selection. The continuously programmable and nonvolatile states of the selected ionoelastomer synapse are harnessed to emulate a soft neural network and perform the handwritten digit and fashion image recognition tasks, which achieve high recognition accuracies comparable to ideal numeric model but only using 16 discrete device states.

Schematic illustration of MBSLS design and its application in spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair represents an immense challenge globally. Despite various beneficial strategies having been attempted for SCI repair, the ideal therapy has not yet been achieved. In this study, a multidimensional biomimetic spinal cord&#8208;like scaffold (MBSLS) is designed with a hierarchical structure and embryonic neurogenetic microenvironment and neural regeneration in SCI repair. MBSLS successfully regulated the neural differentiation of loaded neural stem cells (NSCs) and regenerated spinal cord&#8208;like tissue in vitro by promoting neurogenesis, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, synapse organization, and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the NSC&#8208;loaded scaffold achieves exceptional SCI repair through highly efficient axonal regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction, which significantly improves the recovery of motor function, sensory function, and autonomic function in vivo. Importantly, the MBSLS scaffold achieves seamless integration with the host spinal cord in only 5 min, allowing early cell infiltration and repair. Finally, the feasibility of the minimally invasive implantation of human&#8208;sized MBSLS in a pig SCI model is confirmed, demonstrating its potential and prospects for clinical translation to treat SCI.

         <title>Double Heterostructures for Monolayer Materials with Record Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure leveraging type&#8208;I band alignment in a double&#8208;gate design, where carriers transport through a wide indirect&#8208;bandgap WSe2 multilayer and are confined in a narrow direct&#8208;bandgap MoTe2 monolayer for efficient emission. The device achieves record 1% external quantum efficiency among TMDC p&#8208;n junctions and 24&#8208;fold power efficiency that of single MoTe2 counterpart, enabling silicon&#8208;integrated light sources.








Abstract
2D semiconductor materials have shown great potential and advantages for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, especially compact and integrated light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the lack of a type&#8208;I double&#8208;heterostructure has severely hindered the development of efficient LEDs and lasers based on 2D materials. In this article, a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure is proposed based on a single type&#8208;I heterostructure composed of multilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoTe2 with double back&#8208;gates. This design synergizes the high mobility of the multilayer and the direct bandgap of the monolayer: carrier injection and transport are facilitated in the WSe2 barrier layer, while they are transferred and confined in the MoTe2 well layer for efficient radiative recombination through type&#8208;I band alignment. Therefore, the double&#8208;heterostructure reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1% level, a new record for p&#8208;n junctions based on transition metal dichalcogenides. Additionally, the heterostructure device achieves a 40&#8208;fold enhancement of the maximum electroluminescent intensity and a 24&#8208;fold enhancement of power efficiency compared with the single monolayer MoTe2 counterpart at room temperature. This promising strategy can also be extended to other 2D&#8208;semiconductor LEDs and could bring 2D&#8208;materials devices into practical applications of micro&#8208;LED displays, electrically injected 2D&#8208;materials lasers, and silicon&#8208;based on&#8208;chip light sources.

This study presents an Ir1@FA@MOFs nanocomposite that exploits copper&#8208;coordination and glutathione reduction to trigger an in situ Type II&#8208;to&#8208;Type I photodynamic switch, effectively alleviating tumor hypoxia while simultaneously inducing cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis, thereby potentiating immunogenic cell death for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address these limitations, herein tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;adaptive nanoparticles are rationally designed that enable oxygen&#8208;independent PDT while reprogramming immunosuppressive TME. An Ir(III) complex (Ir1) is engineered to achieve copper&#8208;mediated and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activated switching of photodynamic modes from oxygen&#8208;dependent Type II to hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I PDT via coordination&#8208;induced modulation of electron transfer. This dynamic photosensitizer is precisely integrated into folate receptor&#8208;targeted azomidazole&#8208;bridged Cu(II)&#8208;MOFs, creating an &#8220;AND logic&#8221; responsive nanoplatform (Ir1@FA@MOFs) that simultaneously depletes GSH and generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8210;) under light irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ir1@FA@MOFs orchestrate multimodal cell death induction including cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis through mitochondrial damage. In 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, Ir1@FA@MOFs demonstrate high tumor growth inhibition while converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic hotspots. The work pioneers a TME&#8208;responsive photodynamic modality switching strategy that overcomes traditional PDT limitations through metal&#8208;coordination and GSH&#8208;activating immunogenic death programming, offering new dimensions for precision photo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Containing Bilayer Polymers With Programmable Wrinkling Dynamics Coherent With Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer polymers comprising lanthanide&#8208;coordinated skins and polyurethane substrates exhibit programmable wrinkling dynamics during relaxation. The evolving surface topography modulates visible light, enabling transitions among scattering, iridescence, and transparency. Independently, the metallopolymer layer emits multicolor luminescence under UV light. These features offer a durable, rewritable, dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with high adaptability and spatiotemporal control.








Abstract
A family of lanthanide metallopolymer/polyurethane bilayer polymers exhibiting multicolor luminescence and tunable wrinkling behavior are engineered to combat escalating challenges in information forgery and data leakage. These architectures are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating a lanthanide&#8208;coordinated metallopolymer skin layer onto a polyurethane substrate, facilitating strained&#8208;induced topographical transformations through a tensile&#8208;release process. During dynamic relaxation, the emergent wrinkled topographies modulate optical diffraction, yielding three distinct states: diffuse scattering (frosted glass effect), constructive interference (iridescent rainbow effect), and optical transparency. The metallopolymer skin layer demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency luminescence with broad&#8208;spectrum chromatic emission, while the polyurethane substrate confers exceptional mechanical robustness, optical transparency, and intrinsic self&#8208;healing properties. Consequently, a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform integrating luminescence and structural coloration is realized, offering facile activation, immediate visual verification, and enhanced durability with recyclability. These multifunctional materials exhibit superior performance metrics in encryption and hierarchical anti&#8208;counterfeiting paradigms, surpassing contemporary security technologies in adaptability and functional sophistication.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvent Aggregation Chemistry to Enable Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by solvent aggregation in the inner Helmholtz plane, leading to sluggish Na+ diffusion. This study reveals that a free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, in which polarization interactions induced by orbital overlap between solvent molecules and free radicals, disrupts solvent alignment. This strategy enhances cycling stability, maintaining performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C for 2400 cycles.








Abstract
The capability of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) to operate under extreme temperatures is highly desirable; however, achieving stable performance remains challenging due to limitations in interfacial dynamics. Here, it is revealed that at low temperatures, linear solvents tend to aggregate within the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), leading to the formation of a solvent&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To address this issue, it is proposed to leverage the polarization interaction induced by the orbital overlap between the solvent molecules and free radicals as an effective approach to breaking solvent aggregation. This interaction leads to a redistribution of electron density, reducing the electron cloud density and lowering molecular polarity. Significantly, the reduced polarity weakens intermolecular ordering, promoting interfacial restructuring that enhances mass transfer and facilitates the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double&#8208;layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low&#8208;temperature battery technologies.

         <title>Off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Granular Microtissue Bioinks: Long&#8208;Term Preserved Cellularized Porous Microgels with Enhanced Cell Activity for Shelf&#8208;Ready Biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces long&#8208;term preserved cellularized porous microgels that 1) achieve a considerably long preservation duration (up to 14&#160;months); 2) enable better cell and tissue growth due to the presence of internal interfaces; and 3) allow for injectable and 3D bioprinting use as a novel granular bioink. It advances the form of bioinks and represents a future trend of tissue engineering toward ready&#8208;to&#8208;use products.








Abstract
Off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cellularized products greatly advance the therapeutic practice for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, it remains a challenge to achieve long&#8208;term preservation and superior biological outcomes. Here, the cryo&#8208;gelation methodology is optimized to develop a cellularized porous microgel platform that allows for long&#8208;term cryopreservation on the shelf (up to 14&#160;months) and favors tissue growth due to the presented subvoxel interfaces. The modular granular microtissues serve as an injectable formulation for non&#8208;invasive therapy and innovative printable bioinks for precise biofabrication, free of on&#8208;site operations on cell isolation and preparation. The internal biomaterial interfaces down to the microtissue building blocks significantly enhance cell growth and function, compared to the conventional bulk counterpart. The ready&#8208;to&#8208;use potential of months&#8208;preserved hMSC&#8208;laden modules is demonstrated through subcutaneous injection and critical&#8208;sized skull defect repair in rats, which confirms the benefits of subvoxel interfaces for tissue regeneration. These off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf granular cellularized blocks enable highly accessible and on&#8208;demand use in cell&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R&#8208;SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;)&#8208;mediated endothelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R&#8208;SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site&#8208;specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Structure Determination of Superconducting La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a to Bmab and to I4/mmm is reported in the nickelate superconductor La4Ni3O10, revealing a correlation between I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure, and reveal a new intermediate structure under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in bilayer La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, the crystal structure under high pressure remains elusive due to the lack of single crystal diffraction data. Here, high&#8208;pressure superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature approaching 30K and a zero&#8208;resistance state at 7K at 53.8 GPa is reported in high&#8208;quality single crystals of trilayer La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; grown at ambient pressure. A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a at 5.7 GPa to Bmab at 11.0 GPa and to I4/mmm at 16.6 GPa is unambiguously determined via synchrotron X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, revealing a correlation between the tetragonal I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results not only demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure but also reveal an intermediate structure that was not reported under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.

         <title>Fast, Reconfigurable Domain&#8208;Wall Logic in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers enable field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion over 1.4 km&#160;s&#8722;1. All 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a single domain&#8208;wall device via current density and initial magnetization state adjustment, holding the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.








Abstract
Conventional computing systems, based on silicon transistors, face challenges in meeting the growing demand for high computing efficiency in applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. Spin&#8208;based logic devices, particularly those utilizing chiral domain walls, offer a promising alternative due to their potential for high&#8208;performance and integration with high&#8208;density memory. Here, heterostructures composed of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers are created, enabling field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion at speeds exceeding 1.4&#160;km s&#8722;1. Based on the unique velocity phase diagram with respect to the in&#8208;plane field and current density, the implementation of all 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations, including NAND, AND, XOR, and XNOR, is experimentally demonstrated by adjusting the current density and initial magnetization state. The results highlight the feasibility of multifunctional logic gates in spintronic systems and show the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.

Virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability.

Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particle (VLP) holds significant promise for drug delivery and cancer therapy; however, they encounter challenges related to structural stability and functional versatility. This study reports a biomimetic virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform, which is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability. In vitro experiments validate the exceptional efficacy of the VNPs in achieving targeted protein degradation, while in vivo studies using animal models demonstrate their promising potential for tumor therapy. This approach establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform that overcomes the limitations of protein&#8208;based viral mimics, paving the way for multifunctional nanotherapeutics in cancer therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Bioinspired Meta&#8208;Structural Perovskite Catalysts for Dry Reforming of CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed bioinspired meta&#8208;structural perovskite catalyst (LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3/pseudo&#8208;boehmite) with gradient woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3 mm) is developed, achieving 82.13% CH4 conversion and 9.69 mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield in DRM. Mass transfer and catalytic performance are synergistically coupled by configuring gradient hierarchical pores and tailored flow dynamics, providing a design paradigm for robust, high&#8208;performance catalysts applicable to diverse processes.








Abstract
Conventional packed&#8208;bed catalysts suffer from single&#8208;scale porosity, insufficient mechanical strength, and suboptimal mass transfer efficiency. Inspired by the fractal structure of the lung bronchi, a design and 3D printing method for gradient meta&#8208;structural catalysts is proposed by integrating synthesized LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 (LFN) perovskite with pseudo&#8208;boehmite, achieving ultralow pressure drop and high catalytic efficiency.&#160;Computational fluid dynamics and reaction simulations guide the design of uniform and gradient&#8208;structured catalysts with hierarchical woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3&#160;mm). Compared with homogeneous catalysts, the gradient design theoretically exhibits 1.5&#8208;fold and 1.1&#8208;fold increases in flow velocity and hydrogen production, respectively. Meta&#8208;structural catalysts are fabricated with gradient multi&#8208;peak pore distribution (9.32&#160;nm, 103.75&#160;nm) by regionally modulating unit cell sizes and LFN content (11&#8211;35%) combined with the dehydroxylation of pseudo&#8208;boehmite. 3D&#8208;printed perovskite catalysts demonstrate a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in specific surface area (102.26 m2 g&#8722;1) and compressive strength of 8.48&#160;MPa. In dry reforming of methane (DRM) tests, it achieves 82.13% CH4 conversion, and 9.69&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield, outperforming conventional powder&#8208;packed beds by 10% efficiency. This study achieves mass transfer and catalytic performance coupling by tuning gradient hierarchical pores and tailoring flow dynamics, offering a paradigm for robust, high&#8208;efficiency catalyst design across diverse applications.

         <title>Trojan Horse&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Lipoprotein Nanocarrier for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy of Ocular Fundus Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article&#160;presents a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) that electrostatically binds aflibercept to phosphatidic acid (PA) and incorporates an apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)&#8208;mimetic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#160;via self&#8208;assembly. This nanocarrier enables noninvasive delivery through corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways and effectively suppresses choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a laser&#8208;induced mouse model.








Abstract
Pathological neovascularization is a major cause of vision loss in various ischemic and inflammatory ocular fundus diseases, with current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies requiring invasive and frequent intravitreal injections. In this study, a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) is developed for noninvasive anti&#8208;VEGF therapy via topical administration. Utilizing phosphatidic acid (PA), specifically 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (DOPA), as the sole phospholipid, the nanocarrier enables electrostatic tethering of aflibercept, with a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;functionalized apoA1 mimetic peptide (&#945;CPP) incorporated through self&#8208;assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and intermolecular interaction experiments confirm effective PA&#8211;protein interactions and &#945;CPP incorporation. The nanocarrier demonstrates high encapsulation efficiency, size uniformity, and long&#8208;term stability. It enhances transcellular and paracellular transport by promoting cellular uptake, bypassing lysosomal degradation, and modulating tight junctions. When topically administered, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP efficiently delivers to the posterior segment via corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways. In a laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP eye drops show therapeutic efficacy comparable to a single intravitreal injection, while maintaining excellent ocular and systemic biocompatibility. This biomimetic platform highlights the potential of PA&#8208;mediated protein binding in nanocarrier design, offering a promising strategy for home&#8208;based anti&#8208;VEGF therapy and extending the potential to other protein&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Wideband Multimodal Flexible Sensor Integrating Vertical Graphene and Sea Urchin&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Post&#8208;Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a speech reconstruction framework based on a dual&#8208;sensor system that collects wideband signals from vocal vibrations and throat muscle movements. An encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) model maps the signals to speech without requiring a large&#8208;scale paired training dataset. The system achieves over 95% intent recognition accuracy and generates natural&#8208;sounding speech with a mean opinion score of 2.9.








Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of long&#8208;term disability worldwide, with post&#8208;stroke aphasia significantly impairing communication and social interaction. Traditional rehabilitation devices are often bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use, particularly in speech recovery, where accessible and effective solutions remain limited. To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke&#8208;induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual&#8208;sensor system comprising an Ag&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based sea&#8208;urchin&#8208;like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high&#8208;frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low&#8208;frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large&#8208;scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.

This article employs a binary genetic algorithm to design an ultra&#8208;fine ultrasonic meta&#8208;lens, achieving lateral super&#8208;resolution imaging in the far field (&gt;20&#955;&#8320;). Building on this, longitudinal resolution is effectively restored through frequency domain reconstruction. Additionally, the nonlinear effect of sound waves in the medium is leveraged to significantly enhance both lateral and longitudinal resolutions, reaching &#8776;0.2&#955;&#8320; and 0.68&#955;&#8320;.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging is the long&#8208;sought goal pursued in acoustics. In the past decade, many solutions have been proposed by utilizing various metamaterial devices. For example, in acoustics, the holographic meta&#8208;lens is employed to improve the lateral resolutions of ultrasonic imaging. However, the filtering effect of meta&#8208;lens broadens the acoustic wave pulses, which severely degrades longitudinal resolutions, making the high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging hitherto quite challenging. Here, an innovative solution is proposed by designing and implementing a fully parameter&#8208;optimized meta&#8208;lens. At the fundamental frequency, this meta&#8208;lens can achieve a lateral resolution of 80&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.37&#955;0), successfully breaking the diffraction limit. Through the frequency&#8208;domain reconstruction, the longitudinal resolution is increased to 296&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;1.36&#955;0). Utilizing the nonlinear effect of ultrasound in water, the acoustic meta&#8208;lens can furtherly optimize its imaging quality at the harmonic frequency, where the lateral resolution is increased to 44&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.2&#955;0) with the longitudinal resolution to 148&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.68&#955;0). The work breaks the bias on meta&#8208;lenses with deteriorated longitudinal resolution for broad applications in functional ultrasonic imaging.

         <title>Multimodal Super&#8208;Cooling Textiles for All&#8208;Scenario Passive Hygrothermal Comfort</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all&#8208;scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.








Abstract
Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non&#8208;radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super&#8208;cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra&#8208;high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, respectively), and unidirectional moisture&#8208;wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi&#8208;cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight. Even in hot, humid circumstances, it still provides a 2&#160;&#176;C cooling advantage over cotton. This work thereby provides a promising strategy for personal thermal and moisture management textiles across various complex environments.

         <title>Inverted PAINT for Material&#8208;Specific Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Inverted PAINT, a label&#8208;free super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging method optimized for thick and non&#8208;transparent semiconductor materials. By employing electrostatic dye&#8211;surface interactions in an inverted geometry, the technique enables material&#8208;specific, multicolor, and 3D nanoscale imaging, with applications in semiconductor metrology, defect detection, and analysis of various inorganic nanomaterials.








Abstract
Recent advances in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy have extended its application beyond traditional biological samples to include various organic materials such as polymers and lipid layers. However, its application to inorganic materials, including semiconductor substrates, still remains limited due to technical challenges associated with their thickness, optical opacity, and the lack of effective fluorophore labeling methods. To overcome these challenges, a label&#8208;free Inverted point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) imaging method is developed for thick and non&#8208;transparent inorganic nanomaterials by addressing the limitations of conventional PAINT imaging. By placing the sample in an inverted orientation and utilizing electrostatic interactions to control dye movement against gravity, silica&#8208;specific and silicon&#8208;specific nanoimaging of silica&#8211;silicon line&#8208; and hole&#8208;patterned semiconductor wafers, respectively is achieved. Through systematic optimization of polymer coating, dye charge, pH, refractive index, and dye concentration, it is demonstrated that the Inverted PAINT imaging method successfully visualizes sub&#8208;100&#160;nm line patterns with a resolution of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as well as enables multi&#8208;color and 3D nanoimaging. The method is anticipated to serve not only as a non&#8208;destructive and material&#8208;specific nanoimaging technique for a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, but also as a next&#8208;generation tool for semiconductor metrology and defect inspection.

         <title>Flexible Photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia. This study introduces a fully implantable, wireless photovoltaic neurostimulator that integrates flexible self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic cells. This adaptive optoelectronic system enables near&#8208;infrared&#8208;triggered nerve electrical stimulation, showing significant pain reduction in neuropathic conditions.








Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, often requiring prolonged opioid use and exposing patients to associated complications. Current nerve electrical stimulation (ES) techniques show promise for analgesia but are constrained by their invasive nature and the potential risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. In this study, a novel approach is introduced to managing chronic pain through the development of a fully implantable, wireless, and self&#8208;adaptive photovoltaic neurostimulator (PVNS). This innovative device combines flexible, self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, enabling near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered nerve ES. In vivo neuralgia models demonstrate significant analgesic effects, while mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of inflammatory pathway regulation and modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). The PVNS eliminates the difficulty for tethered stimulation and reduces the risk of peripheral nerve injury, offering a groundbreaking and minimally invasive solution for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

         <title>A Nanobiocatalyst&#8208;Driven Hybrid System for Efficient and Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Electron Flow Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermetallic nanobiocatalyst LPBC, featuring an ordered atomic structure and defined electronic properties, is designed and integrated with Clostridium pasteurianum to construct an efficient, sustainable biohydrogen hybrid system. LPBC stimulates transcriptional enhancement for biohydrogen production, and targets NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase to catalyze intracellular tandem reactions for directional electron modulation, achieving a 103% production rate increase with 30&#8208;day long&#8208;lasting performance.








Abstract
Biohydrogen production offers a promising pathway for developing clean and renewable energy sources. However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy&#8208;efficient and output&#8208;sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self&#8208;assembling intermetallic (L10) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with Clostridium pasteurianum. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare C. pasteurianum system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.

However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy-efficient and output-sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self-assembling intermetallic (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with &lt;i&gt;Clostridium pasteurianum&lt;/i&gt;. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare &lt;i&gt;C. pasteurianum&lt;/i&gt; system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling Microstructure Selection in an Additively Manufactured Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processing&#8211;microstructure&#8211;property relationships in additively manufactured high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are studied, showing&#160;how increasing solidification rate drives solidification morphology from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase structures, enabling tunable strength&#8211;ductility combinations. Integrated thermodynamic modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and multiscale characterization clarify the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic factors in microstructure selection of additively manufactured HEAs.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for advanced structural applications due to their excellent mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM), with its rapid solidification conditions, enables the creation of unique nonequilibrium microstructures. To fully leverage the synergy between AM and HEAs, understanding how processing affects structure and properties is essential. Here, how solidification rate influences microstructure evolution and phase transformation pathway in laser additively manufactured AlCrFe2Ni2 eutectic HEAs is investigated. By increasing the laser scan speed and hence the solidification rate, distinct solidification modes evolving from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase solidification are revealed. These transitions result in distinct microstructures and a wide range of mechanical properties. Thermodynamic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that low cooling rates allow for sufficient atomic diffusion and phase separation, facilitating coupled eutectic growth. In contrast, rapid cooling suppresses diffusion and destabilizes the solid&#8211;liquid interface, promoting anomalous or single&#8208;phase solidification. This integrated experimental and computational approach provides a multiscale understanding of solidification mechanisms in HEAs and underscores how kinetic effects can over&#8208;ride thermodynamic predictions under nonequilibrium conditions. These results demonstrate that AM can serve as a powerful tool to design HEAs with tailored microstructures and properties.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Perfect Pt Cocatalyst with a Spatially Oriented Distribution of Pt2+/Pt0 for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect Pt cocatalyst is developed featuring a near&#8208;zero proton reduction barrier and isolated O2 adsorption by precisely regulating the Pt2+/Pt0 ratio. This work underscores the critical role of spatial orientation distribution of Pt valence states in photocatalytic reactions, demonstrating generalizable design principles applicable to photoelectrocatalysis, organocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.








Abstract
Loading the cocatalyst, e.g., Pt, is a promising strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting, in which metallic state Pt&#176; facilitates proton reduction and positive valence state Pt2+ inhibits H2/O2 recombination. However, simultaneously leveraging the advantages of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt&#8208;photocatalyst hybrids for photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a universal strategy is demonstrated for modulating Pt valence state, obtaining a spatially oriented distribution of Pt2+/Pt3 and a close to zero proton reduction barrier, along with isolated O2 adsorption. As a proof of concept, Pt undergoes electron transfer to ZnIn2S4, accompanied by partial oxidation from Pt0 to Pt2+ through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient centers in ZnIn2S4 via vanadium doping and sulfur vacancy (V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS). Reverse electron transfer induces Pt2+ dominating 83% of the region near the Pt/V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS interface and Pt0 dominating in the remaining 17% near the Pt cluster center, which can be extended to other Pt&#8208;based catalyst systems. The dominant Pt2+ inhibits O2 adsorption and induces the lowest H2/O2 recombination rate of 4%, and the minimal Pt0 obtains a 152.2&#8208;fold increase in photogenerated electron density, ultimately realizing a 45.4&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic activity. A 10 m2 large&#8208;area photocatalytic system is fabricated, producing 6.4 L of H2 per day under natural sunlight.

In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified.

Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Origin of Synergy in Bicomponent Metal Nitride&#8211;Metal Single Atom Catalysts for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.








Abstract
To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher eg/t2g promotes the conversion of Li2S4&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; promotes the conversion of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte. A thorough comprehension of the catalytic properties from both electronic and structural standpoints provides a novel viewpoint for understanding and designing LSBs&#8217; catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

         <title>Prelithiation of Alloy Anodes via Roll Pressing for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general prelithiation method is developed for alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes via solid&#8208;state lithiation using roll&#8208;pressing with thin lithium foil. This mechanical prelithiation method is compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing and allows for a controlled extent of prelithiation. Prelithiated Si, Al, and Sn anodes, as well as multi&#8208;component foil anodes, exhibit improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability in solid&#8208;state batteries with sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries with alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes can feature enhanced energy density and safety compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, diffusional Li trapping within Li alloys often causes low initial Coulombic efficiency and leads to capacity loss with cycling. Here, a general roll&#8208;pressing prelithiation method compatible with a variety of alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes (silicon, aluminum, tin, and multi&#8208;phase alloys) is introduced, which is shown to improve performance in solid&#8208;state batteries. By warm&#8208;rolling lithium foil of controlled thickness with various alloy&#8208;type electrodes, both slurry&#8208;cast and foil&#8208;type electrodes can be uniformly prelithiated via direct chemical reaction. The prelithiated electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacity and extended cycle life in batteries with Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Prelithiated multi&#8208;phase foil electrodes with a tailored interface are shown to exhibit superior cycling stability down to 2&#160;MPa stack pressure. This prelithiation technique offers a pathway to overcome intrinsic challenges in alloy anodes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Biovision&#8208;Inspired Perovskite Intelligent Camera for Panchromatic and Metameric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biovision&#8208;inspired intelligent imaging system combines perovskite photodetectors, single&#8208;pixel imaging and deep learning&#8211;driven color fusion to emulate the best of mantis shrimp&#8208;like multispectral vision and human color perception. With multispectral channels in a compact filter&#8208;free setup, the system enables full&#8208;color imaging and metamerism resistance, portending a new paradigm in adaptive color vision technology.








Abstract
Biological vision systems excel at acquiring and processing information, but there is often a trade&#8208;off between these capabilities. For instance, mantis shrimp possess exceptional spectral sensing but poor color perception due to limited neural processing. Taking the best of both worlds, the mantis shrimp's spectral detection ability and the human&#8208;like visual processing power are integrated to achieve full&#8208;color perception. Using an aerosol&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid spraying technique, an array of high&#8208;quality, excess ion migration enhanced perovskite narrowband photodetectors spanning the ultraviolet to visible spectrum is developed. These detectors enable a computational multispectral imaging system that captures seven spectral images in one shot. A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based color fusion network is designed to efficiently translate multispectral inputs into an RGB representation, significantly enhancing color recognition of these mantis shrimp&#8208;inspired multispectral cameras and affording the capability to overcome metamerism. These perovskite intelligent camera leverages the strengths of biological vision and demonstrate a novel approach to multispectral imaging that could advance applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

         <title>Color Tuning in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals using Triptycene/Hydrazone Chiral Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the NF*LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking&#8208;in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) will allow for the multi&#8208;stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller&#8208;like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&#8722;1 in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&#8722;1 upon 442&#160;nm light&#8208;induced Z &#8594; E photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the NF*LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the NF*LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.

A photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is developed to enable high&#8208;performance complementary OECT circuits. The successful demonstration of fully implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation in mice highlights solid&#8208;state &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits and next&#8208;generation bioelectronic technologies.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are crucial for next&#8208;generation (bio&#8208;)electronic devices but are often constrained by the use of aqueous electrolytes, which introduce crosstalk, hinder miniaturization, and limit circuit integration. Here, a photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is presented, enabling high&#8208;performance OECTs and complementary circuits. The &#120580;&#8208;CGN electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (&gt;10 mS cm&#8722;1), comparable to a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte, while supporting precise patterning down to 15 &#181;m, fast transient response times, minimal hysteresis, and excellent stability in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OECTs. Compact solid&#8208;state NAND/NOR gates (500 &#215; 800 &#181;m2), 4&#8208;input NAND gates (1600 &#215; 800 &#181;m2, 8 OECTs), and half&#8208;adders (2 &#215; 1 mm2, 18 OECTs) are demonstrated, all exhibiting correct logic functions and low&#8208;voltage operation. To highlight its potential for implantable bioelectronics, solid&#8208;state spiking circuits, monolithically integrated with flexible cuff electrodes, are developed for vagus nerve stimulation in mice. These findings establish &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits, paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Solvation Design of an Interfacial Self&#8208;Compatible Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Loading Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work proposes an additive&#8208;induced solvation strategy toward an interface self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with anion than EMC molecules, preventing solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust CEI. Consequently, the in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIBs with high loading demonstrate stable cycling performance and a commendable rate capability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) attract extensive attention in stationary energy storage for their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, traditional liquid electrolytes for SDIBs undergo solvent co&#8208;intercalation and severe oxidation decomposition at high voltage, causing unstable cathode structure and low Coulombic efficiency, especially with high loading (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Herein, an interfacial self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (ACPE) is developed via an additive&#8208;induced solvation design strategy. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with Hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) than ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) molecules, prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). ACPE offers a high oxidation stability (5.5&#160;V) and effectively curbs solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the graphite cathode. On the sodium anode, an ACPE&#8208;derived robust interphase enables stable sodium plating/stripping for over 300&#160;h. Consequently, for the first time, an in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIB with high loading (&gt;6.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates stable cycling performance (above 900 cycles) and a commendable rate capability (84.6% capacity retention at 10&#160;C), among the best quasi&#8208;solid DIBs. Even with an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading cathode (&gt;16.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the SDIB maintains a stable capacity for 300 cycles. This solvation strategy of electrolytes paves a new way for developing high&#8208;loading DIBs.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Functionality in Triazine&#8208;Based Emitters: Synergistic Enhancement of Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and TADF&#8208;OLED Performance with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational molecular design strategy is presented for simultaneously enhancing two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing units into a CzTRZ scaffold. The resulting materials exhibit high 2PA cross&#8208;sections, efficient reversed intersystem crossing, and excellent OLED performance, opening new possibilities for advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a single molecular system remains challenging due to an inherent trade&#8208;off in their molecular design requirements. In this study, we present a strategy to enhance both properties by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents into the CzTRZ scaffold, thereby leveraging an electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8208;enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (EWICT) character. The incorporation of TRZCF3 and TRZCN units effectively enhances the charge transfer (CT) character of CzTRZ, resulting in high 2PA cross&#8208;sections (156 GM for CzTRZCF3 and 200 GM for CzTRZCN) and a reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST = ES1 &#8211; ET1). Computational and experimental studies reveal that incorporating TRZCF3 and TRZCN units selectively stabilizes the S1 state and reduces &#916;EST, significantly facilitating the reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Notably, 1c exhibits the fastest RISC rate (kRISC), leading to superior TADF properties and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.5% in OLEDs. Moreover, a relatively high two&#8208;photon brightness of 174 GM is estimated for 1c. These findings demonstrate a rational molecular design strategy for the synergistic enhancement of 2PA cross&#8208;sections and excellent OLED performance, paving the way for applications in advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.

This work presents narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) for SWIR organic photodetectors. The optimized devices through solvent vapor annealing suppress dark current and enhance detectivity while enabling high&#8208;quality blood&#8208;pressure monitoring and real&#8208;time optical communication. The co&#8208;engineering strategy bridges molecular design and device processing to advance SWIR organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The limited noise&#8208;responsivity balance in Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) restricts their biomedical and optoelectronic applications. In this study, this challenge is addressed through molecular&#8208;device co&#8208;engineering by designing two fluorinated narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) coupled with solvent vapor annealing (SVA), achieving low noise and high detectivity in SWIR OPDs. The optimized devices based on BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F, which features enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to terminal fluorination, extend its absorption capability to 1300&#160;nm. Under &#8722;0.1&#160;V bias, the SVA&#8208;processed BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F devices demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low dark current (Jd) of 4.93 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a suppressed trap density of states (tDOS) reduced by an order of magnitude, achieving a shot&#8208;noise limited detectivity (Dsh&#8727;$D_{{\mathrm{sh}}}^*$) of 7.19 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1200&#160;nm. The synergy of molecular design and post&#8208;processing enables an ultra&#8208;fast response time (1.44/1.20 &#181;s rise/fall) and a record&#8208;high &#8722;3&#160;dB cutoff frequency (f&#8722;3&#160;dB) of 648&#160;kHz, demonstrating remarkable performance for SWIR OPDs. These advancements facilitate two groundbreaking applications: deep&#8208;tissue photoplethysmography (PPG) for cuff&#8208;less blood pressure monitoring and high&#8208;speed, real&#8208;time SWIR optical communication. This methodology presents a general strategy to harmonize molecular design with device fabrication in SWIR OPDs.

&lt;p&gt;The limited noise-responsivity balance in Short-wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) restricts their biomedical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Lifting Triplet Degeneracy Through Organic&#8208;Cation Driven Structural Perturbation to Modulate Luminescence of Sb3+&#8208;Doped Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a single&#8208;source, multi&#8208;emissive perovskite with better control over excited&#8208;state manifold splitting is a key challenge. Here, unique 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped halide double perovskites are developed, exhibiting triplet symmetry breaking through organic cation driven structural distortions, in concert with spin&#8208;orbit coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller interactions. This enables a selective population of emissive non&#8208;degenerate states, a key step toward spin&#8208;polarized emission.








Abstract
The spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect (JTE) alter the orbital degeneracy in materials, leading to unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties essential in spintronics, quantum computing, and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, the study employs luminescent p&#8208;xylylenediammonium (PXA) instead of Cs+ in Cs2NaInCl6 to yield 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped (PXA)2NaInCl8 double perovskite and demonstrates a non&#8208;degenerate triplet state resulting from enhanced JTE in the strong SOC regime, featuring distinct emission centers. Consequently, a broadband emission from both PXA and [SbCl6]3&#8722; spans the entire spectrum (350&#8211;750&#160;nm), representing a rare single&#8208;source multi&#8208;emissive 2D perovskite. With in&#8208;depth comparative structural, temperature&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;physical, and theoretical studies, it is elucidated that the synergistic effect of SOC and JTE on the Eg and T2g lattice modes modulate the electronic structure of [SbCl6]3&#8722; by splitting the doubly degenerate E levels of 3T1u&#8727;$^{3}{\mathrm{T}}_{1u}^*$ into non&#8208;degenerate states. The physical model, supported by theoretical studies, explains the energy level splitting required to realize two kinds of radiative minima in the relaxed excited state.

         <title>Pyridocarbene&#8208;Based Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes for Long Device Lifetime over 500 h in Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8211;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) face challenges in achieving high efficiency, color purity, and long device lifetime due to exciton quenching and high energy requirements. In this study, two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy, are designed and synthesized by incorporating pyridocarbene in their ligands. Pyridocarbene enhances the electrochemical stability, strengthens triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characteristics, and improves the spin&#8211;orbit coupling, effectively shortening the exciton lifetime and minimizing the quenching effects. Additionally, the introduction of a methyl group as a conformation manager in Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy further improves the color purity by blue&#8208;shifting and narrowing the emission spectrum. As a result, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228&#160;h at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs. This study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of pyridocarbene and the methyl conformation manager is an effective strategy for improving blue PhOLED performance, enhancing their potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

         <title>Exceptional n&#8208;Type Ionic Thermoelectric Hydrogels by Synergistic Hydrophobic and Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based n&#8208;type ionic thermoelectric hydrogel is developed by synergistic coordination and hydrophobic interactions. This strategy yields a high negative Seebeck coefficient (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%). The hydrogel powers flexible sensors and harvests low&#8208;grade heat, offering a new approach for stretchable ionic thermoelectrics in wearable sensors and heat conversion devices.








Abstract
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) materials show promise for flexible energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing due to their high ionic Seebeck coefficients (Si). However, achieving both high thermoelectric performance and mechanical stretchability, especially in n&#8208;type systems, remains a critical challenge. Herein, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE hydrogel is presented that exhibits both large negative Si (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%) through synergistic effect of coordination and hydrophobic interactions. Leveraging the amphiphilic nature of PVA, its hydrophilic hydroxyl groups form coordination bonds with Cu2+ ions from copper chloride (CuCl2), while its hydrophobic backbone interacts with water&#8208;soluble conjugated polymer (poly(3&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;triethylammonium&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;propy&#8208;loxy)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;thiophene chloride (PMNT). Meanwhile, hydrophobic associations also occur among PMNT chains due to strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and backbone hydrophobicity. This dual&#8208;interaction strategy approach enhances the thermophoretic difference between chloride anions (from both CuCl2 and PMNT) and cations, enabling the giant ionic thermopower. Besides, the long&#8208;range hydrophobic interactions contribute to the overall mechanical robustness. The developed hydrogels are successfully implemented in self&#8208;powered temperature sensors and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems, such as powering a cooling fan by utilizing the waste heat from a working tablet. This work offers an alternative pathway toward developing high&#8208;performance i&#8208;TE materials for wearable electronics and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting applications.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Assisted Rapid Gelation and Foaming of Gradient Hydrogel as Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces with Regulated Charge Accumulation/Dissipation and Enhanced Tactile Sensing Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed to improve the performance of hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors through manipulating the interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics rather than barely enlarging the contact area. The phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced hydrogel foam with gradient porous structure and interfacially accumulated MXene nanosheets simultaneously achieves high sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 and a wide detectable range up to 100 kPa.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors, typically featuring a sandwiched structure of electrode/hydrogel/electrode with charges (electrons and ions) accumulated at both interfaces forming electrical double layers (EDLs), are considered promising candidates as human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs); however, the continuous dense structure limits the deformability of bulk hydrogels, hindering the achievement of high&#8208;sensitivity and wide detectable range. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for enhancing sensitivity predominantly focus on enlarging the changes of hydrogel/electrode contact area upon external force, while overlooking the design of interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics. Herein, polyacrylamide/chitosan/MXene (PAM/CS/MXene, PCM) hydrogels with gradient porosity and tailorable softness are developed following the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced foaming mechanism. Ti3C2TX MXene plays critical roles in promoting rapid gelation, stabilizing bubbles, regulating ion transport kinetics, and modulating charge accumulation/dissipation at the hydrogel/electrode interfaces. As a consequence, the obtained PCM foam (PCMF) tactile sensor exhibits an optimal sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 together with a wide detectable pressure range up to 100 kPa. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated for acquiring and identifying gesture commands to control a robotic arm for swab sampling and the movement of an electric car in a maze game by integrating PCMF sensors with a digital camera for visual feedback and machine learning for accurate recognition, respectively.

         <title>Nonresonant Raman Control of Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonresonant Raman excitation with mid&#8208;infrared pulses induces large&#8208;amplitude lattice motion and ultrafast ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate. A suite of spectroscopic techniques uncovers the underlying dynamics, establishing a low&#8208;energy route to reshape complex energy landscapes and synthesize hidden material phases with unique functionalities on ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
Important advances is recently made in the search for materials with complex multi&#8208;phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light&#8211;matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above&#8208;bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes is experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion is limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid&#8208;infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large&#8208;amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first&#8208;principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast&#160;speeds.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Ternary Strategy and Molecular Electrostatics Collaboratively Optimize Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polymer Donor Organic Solar Cells: Over 20% Efficiency and High Scalability</title>

Inefficient low&#8208;molecule&#8208;weight LWPM6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) using trimeric acceptor TYT&#8208;S are optimized, enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. LWPM6 flexible devices show excellent mechanical stability and solution&#8208;processability, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.








Abstract
Achieving consistent performance across polymer donor batches is crucial for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (HWPM6), low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (LWPM6) has lower efficiency but better stress&#8208;dispersion characteristics and solution&#8208;processability, making its performance improvement vital for practical applications. Here, LWPM6&#8208;based OSCs are optimized by introducing a trimeric guest (TYT&#8208;S). TYT&#8208;S improves PM6:Y6 compatibility, achieving a finer phase separation and a favorable interpenetrating network morphology. A ternary strategy, leveraging molecular electrostatic potential differences, promotes LWPM6 pre&#8208;aggregation, extends film&#8208;formation time, and enhances molecular ordering. The LWPM6&#8208;based ternary system exhibits an optimized vertical phase distribution, with maximum exciton dissociation occurring near the cathode, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.23% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.35%). When BTP&#8208;eC9 replaces Y6, the LWPM6&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a PCE of 20.12% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.64%). Additionally, LW polymers can dissipate stress via segmental motion. After 3000 bending cycles, LWPM6&#8208;based flexible devices retain higher initial efficiency than HWPM6&#8208;based one, demonstrating better mechanical stability. In mini&#8208;modules, they also have good solution&#8208;processability. This work demonstrates that a trimer guest strategy can significantly enhance the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;efficiency LWPM6, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.

Strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt (PyPAI) spacers spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This simultaneously regulates crystallization and establishes a continuous charge transport pathway through a robust &#960;&#8208;conjugated network, overcoming dielectric confinement. Resultant 2D/3D PSCs achieve 26.41% efficiency with enhanced stability.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions exhibit simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability to meet commercial applications. However, dielectric confinement and an intrinsically uncontrollable crystallization process in 2D perovskites typically lead to large exciton binding energies and poor film quality, hindering charge dissociation, carrier transport, and ultimately device performance. Here, a strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt spacer (PyPAI) that can spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is introduced, thereby simultaneously regulating crystal growth and enhancing charge transfer for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The in situ generated 2D perovskite phases effectively modulate nucleation and crystallization kinetics, yielding superior films with vertically oriented crystals and reduced grain boundary density. Concurrently, the robust aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated network establishes continuous energy bands, enabling highly efficient carrier shuttling between the inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework and the cationic organic layers. Consequently, PyPAI&#8208;optimized PSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.41% with superior environmental and operational stability.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Selective Defects Engineering in A&#8208;Site Ordered Layered Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;selective defects strategy is proposed to decouple and optimize activity and durability of A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskites air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). A specific cations&#8208;deficient Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; displays superior activity and stability when used as an RPCCs air electrode, accelerating its commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells facilitate efficient chemical&#8208;electrical energy interconversion, advancing renewable energy utilization. Commercial viability, however, demands intermediate&#8208;to&#8208;low temperatures (ILT, 400&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C) operation, currently constrained by air electrode performance. A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) promises, yet faces activity and stability issues at ILT. Cation defects effectively tune defect structures in simple perovskites, boosting electrochemical performance, but their specific effects in A&#8208;site ordered perovskites with dual A&#8208;site environments remain unexplored. Here, A&#8208;site cation&#8208;selective defects are engineered to tune PBSCF's performance, with Pr&#8208;deficient (Pr0.95Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, p&#8208;PBSCF) and Ba/Sr&#8208;deficient (Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, bs&#8208;PBSCF) variants revealing distinct defects&#8208;performance relationships. Pr defects weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, enhancing oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Concurrently, it lowers oxygen vacancy concentration, inhibiting hydration&#8208;induced lattice expansion. This stabilizes Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and mitigates Ba/Sr segregation, enhancing stability. However, the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration inhibits the material's hydration, lowering proton conduction and thus restricting activity enhancement. In contrast, Ba/Sr defects not only weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, but also increase oxygen vacancy concentration, promoting proton and oxygen&#8208;ion transport, thereby significantly enhancing electrode activity. Furthermore, despite increased hydration, bs&#8208;PBSCF's larger&#8208;radius cation defects yield a smaller unit cell versus p&#8208;PBSCF, further strengthening Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and inhibiting Ba/Sr segregation, thus leading to superior stability.

         <title>Hydrogen Storage in Magnesium Hydride at Room Temperature Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Stabilized Multivalent Niobium Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;stabilized multivalent niobium oxides catalyst enables rapid and reversible hydrogen storage in MgH2, even under room&#8208;temperature or subzero conditions. The in situ formation of multivalent Nb species (Nb0/Nb2+/Nb4+) facilitates barrierless H2 dissociation and enhances H diffusion. This work offers critical insights into low&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage via a synergistic electronic and catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) remains hindered by intrinsic, complicated kinetic barriers associated with both hydrogen release and uptake, particularly under mild conditions. In this work, graphene&#8208;confined, low&#8208;crystallinity niobium oxide nanoparticles are developed to optimize the kinetic barriers across all stages of hydrogen absorption and desorption in MgH2. This is realized by the synergistic effect of in situ&#8208;generated stable multivalent niobium oxide (NbOx) and the electronically modulating graphene. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that Nb2+ enhances H2 dissociation and diffusion, while Nb4+ facilitates Mg&#9472;H bond cleavage and recombination of H2. Graphene serves a dual function by modulating the electronic environment at NbOx interfaces to facilitate charge transfer, while confining nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and hence maintain the catalytic stability of NbOx. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over&#8208;reduced Nb0, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized. This provides a versatile strategy for engineering multivalent oxides for promoting hydrogen storage of MgH2.

&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over-reduced Nb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized. This provides a versatile strategy for engineering multivalent oxides for promoting hydrogen storage of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Omnidirectional Wind Domain Energy Harvesting Based on Dual&#8208;Mode Complementary Strategy of Wind&#8208;Induced Vibration</title>

The dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration realizes broadband breeze vibration energy harvesting and optimizes wind energy collection in a wide range of wind speed and direction, filling the gap in energy collection when the transmission line does not vibrate due to wind direction changes.








Abstract
The harvesting and utilization of vibration energy from transmission lines can effectively advance the development of smart grids. However, variations in wind direction significantly affect the vibration status of transmission lines&#8208;a problem often overlooked in research. This paper clarifies the gap problem of wind&#8208;induced vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines for the first time, and presents a dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration for transmission lines. The core innovation is to achieve self&#8208;adaptive omnidirectional wind domain energy harvesting by wind&#8208;vibration energy collaborative response, which overcomes the limitation of single vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines that depend on a specific wind direction. The designed wind&#8208;vibration hybrid nanogenerator (W&#8208;VHNG) ingeniously integrates two different TENG mechanisms to achieve broadband breeze vibration energy capture (vibration frequency range of 5&#8211;60&#160;Hz), wide wind speed and direction adaptability (wind speed range of 4.2&#8211;14 m&#160;s&#8722;1 and the wind direction range of &#177;30&#176;), and mW&#8208;scale power output (maximum mean power of 1.33&#160;mW). Finally, the potential of the W&#8208;VHNG for self&#8208;powered sensing of transmission lines is highlighted through three application strategies. This research provides a new solution for the sustainable harvesting of complex and variable high&#8208;entropy energy in transmission lines.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Sustainability Trilemma in all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Modules via Oxidative Blockchain Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>

This study presents an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular&#8208;assisted buried interface engineering strategy for achieving comprehensive lifecycle management of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules and breaking the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;sustainability trilemma for practical applications.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are vital for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules (TSMs), yet their commercialization remains limited by challenges in balancing efficiency, stability, and sustainability. Here, we presented an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular (BCM) interface engineering strategy, which modified the poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) surface and constructed a dynamic functional layer at the buried PEDOT:PSS/Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite interface through synergistic effects of biocompatible rutin molecules and their oxidation derivatives. This approach enabled full&#8208;cycle optimization from film formation to operational longevity via sequential regulation of crystallization and carrier dynamics, along with persistent defect passivation through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding. Resulting NBG devices achieved champion efficiencies of 23.50% (0.045 cm2) and 17.10% (10.4 cm2), respectively. The all&#8208;perovskite TSMs (10.4 cm2) attained a 23.00% aperture efficiency (an active&#8208;area efficiency of 24.30%) and retained &#8764;90% efficiency after 640 h of continuous illumination (extrapolated TPCE80 lifetime of 3900 h) and after 15 cycles of day&#8208;night fatigue tests. Additionally, BCM's dual protection effects (physical barrier and chemical chelation) reduced lead leakage of severely damaged TSMs by 90% under simulated heavy rainfall, demonstrating strong environmental resilience. This work offers a scalable molecular strategy for advancing perovskite photovoltaics from lab&#8208;scale innovation to industrial viability.

         <title>Superstructure Engineering Enables NASICON&#8208;Type Phosphate Cathodes with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the calcination temperature during synthesis, the Fe3+ is preferentially migrated to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering in monoclinic Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP&#8208;S), which can increase Fe&#9472;O ionic characters due to electronic structure arrangement, finally elevating the Fe2+/Fe3 redox potential from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, corresponding to the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 versus the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP).








Abstract
Na+ Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON)&#8208;type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathode has attained extensive research interest due to its green, low cost, and superior rate capability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, owing to strong Fe&#9472;O covalent character in the NASICON frameworks, the low Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential (&lt;2.5&#160;V vs Na+/Na) has led to an undesirable energy density of phosphate cathode. Herein, superstructure engineering is employed to increase the ionic characteristics of Fe&#9472;O bonds and the working voltage of Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples. The combined analysis of advanced structural characterization and theoretical calculation indicates that the Fe3+ ions can migrate to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering by manipulating calcination temperature during synthesis. The Fe delocalization and electronic structure rearrangement can enlarge the energy gap between antibonding orbital and the Fermi energy level. As a concept proof, the as&#8208;prepared Na3VFe(PO4)3 cathode with Fe/Na_v superlattice structure enables an increase in Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, accompanied by the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1, compared with the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 electrode. This work paves the way for increasing the working voltage and energy density of NASICON type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atom Evaporator: Collaborative Omnibearing Light Trapping Stereo Structures for Efficient Water Transport Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D conical cone array evaporators is prepared based on high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom composite thermal management materials which only contain 3 wt.%. This design achieves a water evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#160;m&#8722;2 along with an evaporation efficiency of 94.5% under 1.0 sunlight irradiation. The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.








Abstract
Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra&#8208;low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro&#8208;porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.

The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high-entropy single-atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra-low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro-porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A p&#8208;Type Liquid&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor with Synergistic Morphological and Charge&#8208;Dynamic Modulation Enables 20.3%&#8208;Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A classical p&#8208;type liquid crystalline organic semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzothienobenzothiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), is incorporated into the organic photovoltaic active layer as a dual&#8208;functional additive. Its incorporation optimizes the blend morphology with favorable phase separation, extends exciton diffusion length, and significantly improves charge transport dynamics. The binary device based on D18:L8&#8208;BO processes using Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.








Abstract
Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p&#8208;type rod&#8208;like liquid crystalline (LC) organic&#8208;semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p&#8208;type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge&#8208;transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.

         <title>Redefining PbS Quantum Dot Photovoltaics: p&#8208;i&#8208;n Devices with Superior Efficiency and Reproducibility</title>

Report a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL) is reported for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 14% (certified 13.62%), surpassing the previous 9.70% p&#8208;i&#8208;n record and exceeding the certified PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architecture in both efficiency and reproducibility.








Abstract
Developing diverse photovoltaic device architectures is essential not only for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also for enabling seamless integration with other photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance tandem configurations. While n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures have historically dominated the development of PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cells, p&#8208;i&#8208;n counterparts have significantly lagged behind in efficiency, limiting their potential for further advancement. In this work, the advantage of the surface tunability of CQDs is taken by anchoring the classical self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecule MeO&#8208;2PACz onto PbS CQDs via ligand exchange, forming a PbS&#8208;SAM bridging&#8208;layer, which is inserted between NiOx/SAM and the CQD active layer, resulting in a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL). This structure effectively passivates the buried interfacial traps and enhances hole extraction. As a result, a record PCE approaching 14% is achieved, with a certified value of 13.62%, which is not only largely surpassing the previous highest value of 9.70% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, but also exceeds the current PCE record set by n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Moreover, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration exhibits excellent reproducibility, providing a robust and scalable platform for future applications, particularly as a narrow&#8208;bandgap subcell in monolithic tandem devices with wide&#8208;bandgap materials such as perovskites.

An amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAM breaks the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off associated with the MCl6 anionic framework, achieving both high ionic conductivity and high discharge capacity.








Abstract
Halide cathode active materials (CAMs) with high ionic conductivities have attracted significant attention. However, their capacity and energy density are limited by the large molar weight of the Li&#8314; transport&#8208;dependent MCl6 anionic framework. In this study, a low&#8208;cost amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is introduced that overcomes the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity and low discharge capacity associated with the MCl6 framework. LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM achieves dual breakthroughs, exhibiting an impressive ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, and a high specific capacity of 586 mAh g&#8722;1 via an intercalation&#8208;conversion reaction at 60&#160;&#176;C. Due to its superior ionic conductivity and capacity, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM enables a catholyte&#8208;free electrode to achieve an exceptional energy density of &#8776;1100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1cathode and a power density of 2185&#160;W kg&#8722;1cathode at 60&#160;&#176;C, surpassing reported halide&#8208; and oxide&#8208;based CAMs by 1.5 to 3 times. Additionally, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is highly cost&#8208;effective ($9.3 kg&#8722;1) and exhibits remarkable humidity stability, retaining 100% of its capacity after 12 h of exposure to 5 &#177; 1% humidity. The multifunctional iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAMs open new avenues for advancing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well&#8208;suited for edge neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non&#8208;volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device&#8208;based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption.

     alt="Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi-level frequency&#8211;voltage (&lt;i&gt;f&#8211;V&lt;/i&gt;) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well-suited for edge neuromorphic computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non-volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi-level frequency&#8211;voltage (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&#8211;V&lt;/i&gt;) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device-based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, intrinsic plasticity endows the network with structural plasticity, enabling full recovery of the network's performance after random neuron damage, suggesting a pathway toward more adaptive and resilient neuromorphic computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic 3D&#8208;Printed Adaptive Hydrogel Bioadhesives Featuring Superior Infection Resistance for Challenging Tissue Adhesion, Hemostasis, and Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel bioadhesives (PTLAs) are designed to address the limitations of existing bioadhesives, offering solutions for challenging tissue adhesion and enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs feature robust wet/underwater tissue adhesion/sealing, superior freeze/pressure and infection resistance, and adaptive self&#8208;healing/gelling capacity, presenting transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., and inspiring next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design.








Abstract
Conventional suturing and stapling cause additional trauma, pain, and cost for patients. As alternatives, existing bioadhesives suffer from imprecise fabrication, limited wet tissue adhesion, and insufficient biological functionalities for effective wound management. This work proposes biomimetic hydrogel bioadhesives composed of modified natural tannic acid (TA), hyperbranched polylysine (HPL), and acrylic acid (AA), abbreviated PTLAs, to offer solutions for tissue adhesion under challenging environments (underwater, body fluids, cold, pressure), and for enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs are fabricated via 3D printing, enabling the precise and controlled production of bioadhesives that are customized in a personalized manner with great reproducibility. Inspired by molluscs, developed PTLAs exhibit robust wet and underwater tissue adhesion, outperforming commercial and many recently reported bioadhesives. Ex vivo lamb and in vivo rat models demonstrate ultrafast (5&#160;s) and efficient sealing and hemostasis. Exceptional freeze resistance and pressure resistance further expand their applicability to extreme environments. Meanwhile, coupled with superior infection resistance, PTLAs ensure enhanced wound healthcare while sealing and hemostasis. Further, their self&#8208;gelling feature supports dry powder adhesion/sealing applications, practical packaging, and long&#8208;term storage. Overall, adaptive tissue&#8208;like PTLAs present transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design and enhanced healthcare solutions.

         <title>Steep&#8208;Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor TS&#8208;FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware&#8208;based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware&#8208;based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor (TS&#8208;FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off current ratio (&gt;107), and ultra&#8208;low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu+ ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS&#8208;FET as energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device applications for next&#8208;generation SNN&#8208;based neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Sustainable 4D Printing of Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composites for Autonomous Task Execution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur&#8208;rich polymer composites is demonstrated for the first time using loosely crosslinked poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic composites (MPSNs). 3D&#8208;printed PSNs and MPSNs exhibit shape&#8208;morphing capabilities and can be directly reprinted into new form factors and magneto&#8208;responsive soft robots. 3D&#8208;printed MPSNs can serve as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasable stirring bar for chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;programmable polymer networks derived from waste elemental sulfur hold great potential for diverse applications such as 4D printing and soft robotics. However, their crosslinked nature makes it challenging to 3D print complex geometry for soft robots. Herein, a closed&#8208;loop 4D printing strategy is reported of poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic particle composites (MPSNs) to fabricate multi&#8208;functional soft robots with programmable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities. The dynamic S&#9472;S bonds within the loosely crosslinked PSNs impart shear&#8208;thinning behavior, enabling hot&#8208;melt extrusion of both PSNs and MPSNs into complex architectures. After shape&#8208;programming, 3D&#8208;printed PSN and MPSN structures exhibit heat&#8208; or light&#8208;triggered shape recovery and allow modular assembly for spatially selective shape&#8208;morphing governed by the distinct glass transition temperatures of the PSN series. These architectures can be readily reprinted into new form factors, demonstrating a closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing. With multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness and solvent resistance provided by the PSN composites, the MPSN capsule serves as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasing magnetic stirring bar in a reagent&#8208;containing solution, autonomously releasing catalysts at a preset temperature to facilitate carbamate synthesis. The 4D printable MPSNs offer a sustainable platform not only for adaptable shape&#8208;morphing and dynamic actuation but also for autonomous task execution in next&#8208;generation soft robotic applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture.

     alt="Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next-Generation Displays"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light-emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out-coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive-matrix displays can present flicker-free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single-unit quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out-coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record-breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and an ultralow turn-on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first-ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive-matrix displays can present flicker-free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next-generation displays and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing Structural Distortion by Tailoring Orbital Interactions in High&#8208;Voltage Polyanionic Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main structural distortion of the KVPO4F cathode is attributed to the V5+ octahedral distortion. Low energy&#8208;level Mn is introduced into V site to enhance the matching of the central transition metal ion's 3d orbitals with the ligands&#8217; 2p orbitals in &#963; and &#960; symmetry. The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.








Abstract
The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high&#8208;voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO4F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO4F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy&#8208;level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi&#8208;electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry&#8208;matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Programmable Active Phase Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward High&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study harnesses multimetallic synergy to program dynamic evolution of 2D nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks to architect high&#8208;activity oxyhydroxides phase for oxygen evolution. The cascade control of reconstruction dynamics, terminated structure state, and catalytic pathways deciphers &#8220;reconstruction&#8208;catalysis&#8221; programming principles. This paradigm shift enables on&#8208;demand design of efficient electrocatalysts through proactive reconstruction steering.








Abstract
Orchestrated manipulation of the dynamic structural evolution of catalytic materials in service represents an effective approach to rationally architect the active phase for highly efficient catalysis. Herein, this study reports a 2D ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) pre&#8208;catalyst, where multimetallic electronic cooperativity enables on&#8208;demand hierarchical regulation of the structural evolution as well as the catalytic process of the reconstruction&#8208;derived active phase, delivering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to benchmark RuO2. Tailored cobalt&#8208;iron co&#8208;substitution in nickel&#8208;based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand&#8208;anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal&#8208;oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF&#8208;derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Density in Dielectric Polymers Near Glass Transition Temperature by Molecular Twisting Conformation Locking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular twisting conformation locking strategy is proposed and demonstrated to simultaneously suppress intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways in high glass transition temperature (Tg) dielectric polymers, addressing their compromised electrical insulation at elevated operating temperatures near their Tg. A novel dielectric polymer featuring molecular twisting conformation locking maintains stable operation at 250&#160;&#176;C while achieving ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers with high operating temperatures (To) for capacitive energy storage applications are urgently needed in new energy vehicles and power electronics. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (Tg), such as Kapton polyimide (Tg&#8776;360&#160;&#176;C), suffer low To (&lt; 150&#160;&#176;C) due to electron delocalization between donor and acceptor units. Here, a molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking strategy is proposed for high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers to block intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the elevated leakage current in polyimides originates from enhanced electron delocalization induced by intrachain imide ring planarization and interchain donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. The molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking disrupts intrachain imide ring planarization and the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of interchain D&#8208;A units. As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its Tg), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming existing high&#8208;Tg dielectric polymers. This study introduces a design paradigm to address the challenge of dielectric polymers that do not function properly as ambient temperatures approach their Tg.

As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming existing high-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; dielectric polymers. This study introduces a design paradigm to address the challenge of dielectric polymers that do not function properly as ambient temperatures approach their &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Multispectrum Electromagnetic Response in FeNiHo/C Heterodimensional Structure for Microwave Absorption and Multimode Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel FeNiHo/C hierarchical heterodimensional structured with multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response. Through multi&#8208;scale polar heterointerface engineering, the heterodimensional structure achieves ultra&#8208;broadband microwave absorption, in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property, and multimode photodetections. These results inspire the development of electromagnetic multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Multispectrum response technology is the key to developing multifunctional electromagnetic devices in cross&#8208;field applications. Traditional methods rely on integrating complex multi&#8208;material systems, leading to bulkier and costlier devices. Here, a hierarchical heterodimensional structure composed of FeNiHo alloy and carbon matrix achieves autonomous multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response between microwave and ultraviolet through polar interface engineering. In the microwave band, the heterodimensional structure exhibits outstanding microwave absorption performance with high reflection loss of &#8722;46.87 dB and ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth of 8.96 GHz. Furthermore, the antenna arrays based on the heterodimensional structure demonstrate in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property by a coupled ultraviolet stimulation, where the largest frequency modulation range reaches 5.05 GHz in Ku&#8208;band. In the ultraviolet band, multimode photodetectors constructed by the heterodimensional structure possess excellent responsivity and accurate decoding ability for anti&#8208;interference ultraviolet communication. Particularly, the metamaterial detector achieves analog signal communication for the first time by microwave&#8208;ultraviolet coupling response. This work pioneers a novel approach to developing multifunctional electromagnetic materials for multispectrum applications.

         <title>Sustainable Clay Electrolytes for Aqueous Batteries: All&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Ion Conductor with Nanoconfined Hydration Shell Reorganization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specifically designed clay&#8208;based single&#8208;ion conductor with unique hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration mechanism is utilized as the all&#8208;temperature electrolyte to endow the working temperature range of the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Ion transport property and water structure of electrolytes are two of the most important issues for aqueous batteries, especially when operated at extreme temperatures. To this end, a sepiolite&#8208;based clay electrolyte (SCYE) with nanoconfined channels as single&#8208;ion conductor is proposed. The inner Zn2+ and anions solvation shells exhibit fascinating hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration behavior compared to the conventional Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes. The bond&#8208;orientational order of the Zn2+ and anions is broken and highly developed, respectively, thus improving the Zn2+ transference number to 0.97. Moreover, free water molecules are dramatically reduced in the SCYE, contributing to improved anti&#8208;freezing ability and thermal stability. The single&#8208;ion transport property of the SCYE endows the PANI||Zn full cells with excellent rate performances, with an &#8776;84% capacity retention from 1 to 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, full cells with the SCYE achieve 17,000 cycles under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and considerable performances even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, while they can operate over 3000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C with 87% capacity retention. This attracting effect can be expanded to several other clay materials, all presenting improved ion transport capability, which paves a road for future aqueous batteries across extreme temperatures.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Production Through Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon for Self&#8208;Sustaining Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green hydrogen production through a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.








Abstract
Green hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) powered by clean energy is a promising and environmentally friendly technology. However, it relies on a high&#8208;purity water source, which is limited in regions facing water scarcity. Here, a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system is reported that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The atmospheric water harvester (AWH) component utilizes N and O co&#8208;doped hydrophilic ordered porous carbon, engineered with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure with prosperous channels for efficient mass transport. It enables effective interfacial solar evaporation for water release, achieving a record&#8208;high water harvesting capacity of 0.49 L kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 40% relative humidity (RH). During outdoor tests, the AWH&#8208;PEMWE system reaches a peak green hydrogen production rate of 204 mL h&#8722;1 at midday using only atmospheric water as feedstock. Remarkably, the system remains operational under ultra&#8208;low humidity conditions down to 20% RH, addressing the challenge of water availability in arid environments. Importantly, the system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.

         <title>Decoupling of Carrier Pathways in Au/Cu&#8208;Zn3In2S6 Through Bulk Hole Trapping and Surface Hot Electron Accumulation Enhances Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and implement Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H2O2 production but is hindered by charge recombination and non&#8208;selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 (Au/Cu&#8208;d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn3In2S6 by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O2&#8722; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O2. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 of H2O2 under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.

The optimized catalyst achieves an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competitive Crystallization Modulated Phase&#8208;Homogeneous Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenyl phosphate is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization for improving compositional distribution, efficiency, and stability in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) PSCs. The homogeneous WBG perovskite boosts the efficiencies up to record values of 21.39% (1.72&#160;eV) and 19.64% (1.84&#160;eV), and maintains 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100&#160;h. The resulting PO&#8208;TSCs achieve champion efficiencies of 26.11% (certified 25.07%).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley&#8208;Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri&#8208;PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri&#8208;PyPA with PbBr2 reduces the effective charge on Pb2+ and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br&#8208;rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri&#8208;PyPA forms a six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation allows Tri&#8208;PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite&#8208;organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Asymmetric Stress Engineering of Dense Dislocations in Brittle Superconductors for Strong Vortex Pinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;engineering strategy enables the direct formation of ultra&#8208;dense dislocations in rigid crystals through extrusion&#8208;induced asymmetric stress fields. These tilted dislocation arrays act as efficient pinning centers for magnetic vortices, leading to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of iron&#8208;based superconductors under high magnetic fields. The method provides a general, scalable pathway for dislocation design in brittle materials.









Abstract

Large lossless currents in high&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their 1D geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non&#8208;metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation&#8208;mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, an asymmetric stress field strategy is proposed using extrusion to directly nucleate a high density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear&#8208;driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron&#8208;based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of &#8776;1 &#197; trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of IBS at 33 tesla (T), along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.

         <title>Robust Sustainable Interfacial Evaporators from Lignin for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developes a series of sustainable metal&#8208;lignin composites via a one&#8208;pot reaction between lignin and heavy metal ion&#8208;containing wastewater. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites demonstrates significantly enhanced light absorption and photothermal conversion performances compared to unmodified lignin, which are originated from the synergistic effects of oxidation, coordination, and the formation of metal oxides. The metal&#8208;lignin composites are architecturally structured into evaporators, with the optimized evaporator demonstrating an elevated evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, also with long&#8208;term stability, efficient wastewater and seawater purification capacities, and notable economic benefits.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, owing to its environmentally friendly and sustainable energy input advantages. However, the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficiency photothermal agents with enhanced heavy&#8208;metal ion tolerance remains a significant challenge for advancing practical solar&#8208;powered wastewater treatment. Herein, we developed a series of metal&#8208;lignin composites, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving lignin and heavy metal&#8208;contained wastewater, which demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;harvesting efficiency and photothermal conversion properties. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites can be efficiently fabricated into evaporators via 3D printing technology for wastewater treatment. The optimized evaporator achieves an exceptional water evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation while demonstrating outstanding performance in both seawater and heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater systems. Moreover, the evaporator exhibits no significant decline in evaporation rate during continuous wastewater treatment over 7 days, highlighting its exceptional durability and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, techno&#8208;economic analysis estimates the production cost of clean water by the evaporator at 0.372&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3, below the industry average and even approaching the globally reported lowest threshold for reverse osmosis desalination. This work is believed to offer valuable insights into achieving cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater purification technologies from lignin.

         <title>Bioinspired Polyimide/Carbon Nanotube Aerogels With Core&#8208;Radiating and Omasum&#8208;Like Morphology toward Excellent Electromagnetic Shielding and Superior Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphogenetic approach is established to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.








Abstract
Lightweight polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI SE of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1). Remarkably, the C67&#8208;5.0 aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.

Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core-radiating patterns, microscopic omasum-like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightweight polymer-based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next-generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (&lt;i&gt;SE&lt;/i&gt;) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze-drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core-radiating patterns, microscopic omasum-like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI &lt;i&gt;SE&lt;/i&gt; of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Remarkably, the &lt;i&gt;C67-5.0&lt;/i&gt; aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

The Br&#8208;COF with D&#8208;A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron&#8208;rich environments, further promoting Li+ migration and LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&#8722; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br&#8208;groups as electron&#8208;rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li+ transference.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li+ transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine&#8208;modified covalent organic framework (Br&#8208;COF) with donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li+ migration and high stability LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&#8722; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing Br&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron&#8208;rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li+ local coordination environment to facilitate Li+ transference. Consequently, Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.78). Li|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and LFP|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li and NCM90|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid&#8208;state LMBs.
