         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Bridged Asymmetric CuNi Bimetallic Atom Sites for CO2 Reduction with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed catalysts with novel S&#8208;bridged Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni sites (named Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC) is synthesized with biomass wool keratin as precursor. The plentiful disulfide bonds in wool keratin overcame the limitations of conventional gas&#8208;phase S&#8208;ligand etching process and realized one&#8208;step formation of S&#8208;bridged sites. The S&#8208;bridged sites facilitate the charge redistribution of Cu and Ni during CO2RR, resulting in high CO selectivity.








Abstract
Double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with asymmetric coordination are crucial for enhancing the benefits of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction and advancing sustainable development, however, the rational design of DACs is still challenging. Herein, this work synthesizes atomically dispersed catalysts with novel sulfur&#8208;bridged Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni sites (named Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC), utilizing biomass wool keratin as precursor. The plentiful disulfide bonds in wool keratin overcome the limitations of traditional gas&#8208;phase S ligand etching process and enable the one&#8208;step formation of S&#8208;bridged sites. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms the existence of bimetallic sites with N2Cu&#8208;S&#8208;NiN2 moiety. In H&#8208;cell, Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC shows high CO Faraday efficiency of 98.1% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V versus RHE. Benefiting from the charge tuning effect between the metal site and bridged sulfur atoms, a large current density of 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at &#8722;1.00&#160;V in flow cell. Additionally, in situ XAS, attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show Cu as the main adsorption site is dual&#8208;regulated by Ni and S atoms, which enhances CO2 activation and accelerates the formation of *COOH intermediates. This kind of asymmetric bimetallic atom catalysts may open new pathways for precision preparation and performance regulation of atomic materials toward energy applications.

         <title>Hofmeister Effects in Supramolecular Chemistry for Anion&#8208;Modulation to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of anions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is reported, showing that the right&#8208;side anions in the Hofmeister series that have strong interactions with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) can enhance the stability of Zn anodes and the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD in such electrolytes has a further positive effect, while the left&#8208;side anions show worse rate performance after the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage, which, however, is facing the challenge of instable Zn anodes. The anion is pivotal in the stability of anodes, which are not being paid enough attention to. Herein, the modulation of anions is reported using the Hofmeister series in supramolecular chemistry to boost the stability of Zn anodes. It is found that the right&#8208;side anions in the Hofmeister series (e.g., OTf&#8722;) can enhance the Zn2+ transference number, increase the Coulombic efficiency, facilitate uniform Zn deposition, reduce the freezing point of electrolytes, and thereby stabilize the Zn anodes. More importantly, the right&#8208;side anions can form strong interaction with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) compared to the left&#8208;side anions, and hence the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD can further enhance the stability of Zn anodes in OTf&#8722;&#8208;based electrolytes, showing enhancement of cycling lifespan in the Zn//Zn symmetric cells more than 45.5 times with &#946;&#8208;CD compared with those without &#946;&#8208;CD. On the contrary, the left&#8208;side anions show worse rate performance after the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD. These results provide an effective and novel approach for choosing anions and matching additives to stabilize the anodes and achieve high&#8208;performance AZIBs through the Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Incorporation of Precipitants into High&#8208;Strength Bulk Aluminum Alloys Enables Life&#8208;Long Extraordinary Corrosion Resistance in Diverse Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The safe service and wide applications of lightweight high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys are seriously challenged by diverse environmental corrosion, since high strength and corrosion resistance are mutually exclusive for metals while surface protection cannot provide life&#8208;long corrosion resistance. Here, inspired by fish secreting slime from glands to resist external changes, a strategy of incorporating precipitants as the slime into bulk metals using the inner cavity of opened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the glands is developed to enable high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys with life&#8208;long superior corrosion resistance. The resulting material has ultrahigh tensile strength (&#8764;700&#160;MPa) and extraordinary corrosion resistance in acidic, neutral and alkaline media. Notably, it has the highest resistance to intergranular corrosion, exfoliation corrosion and stress&#8208;corrosion cracking, compared with all previously reported aluminum alloys, and its corrosion rate is even much lower than that of corrosion&#8208;resistant pure aluminum, which results from the pronounced surface enrichment of precipitants released (secreted) from exposed CNTs forming a protective surface film. Such high corrosion resistance is life&#8208;long and self&#8208;healing due to the on&#8208;demand minimal self&#8208;supply of the precipitants dispersed throughout the bulk material. This strategy can be readily expanded to other aluminum alloys, and could pave the way for developing corrosion&#8208;resistant high&#8208;strength metallic materials.

Cost&#8208;effectiveness plays a decisive role in sustainable operating of rechargeable batteries. As such, the low cost&#8208;consumption of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) provides a promising direction for &#8220;how do SIBs/PIBs replace Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) counterparts&#8221; based on their resource abundance and advanced electrochemical performance. To rationalize the SIBs/PIBs technologies as alternatives to LIBs from the unit energy cost perspective, this review gives the specific criteria for their energy density at possible electrode&#8208;price grades and various battery&#8208;longevity levels. The cost ($ kWh&#8722;1 cycle&#8722;1) advantage of SIBs/PIBs is ascertained by the cheap raw&#8208;material compensation for the cycle performance deficiency and the energy density gap with LIBs. Furthermore, the cost comparison between SIBs and PIBs, especially on cost per kWh and per cycle, is also involved. This review explicitly manifests the practicability and cost&#8208;effectiveness toward SIBs are superior to PIBs whose commercialization has so far been hindered by low energy density. Even so, the huge potential on sustainability of PIBs, to outperform SIBs, as the mainstream energy storage technology is revealed as long as PIBs achieve long cycle life or enhanced energy density, the related outlook of which is proceeded as the next development directions for commercial applications.

To rationalize the SIBs/PIBs technologies as alternatives to LIBs from the unit energy cost perspective, this review gives the specific criteria for their energy density at possible electrode-price grades and battery-longevity levels, and provides the correct development direction of energy-storage technologies.

         <title>Organic Semiconductor&#8208;BiVO4 Tandem Devices for Solar&#8208;Driven H2O and CO2 Splitting</title>

Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices offer a promising platform towards direct solar light harvesting and chemical storage. However, most prototypes employ wide bandgap semiconductors, moisture&#8208;sensitive inorganic light absorbers, or corrosive electrolytes. Here, we introduce the design and assembly of PEC devices based on an organic donor&#8208;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which demonstrate long&#8208;term H2 evolution and CO2 reduction in benign aqueous media using a carbon&#8208;based encapsulant. Accordingly, PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR photocathodes display long&#8208;term H2 production for 300&#160;h in a near&#8208;neutral pH solution, whereas photocathodes with a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst attain a CO:H2 selectivity of 5.41&#177;0.53 under 0.1 sun irradiation. Their early onset potentials enable the construction of PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR &#8211; BiVO4 artificial leaves, which couple unassisted syngas production with O2 evolution in a reactor completely powered by sunlight, sustaining a 1:1 ratio of CO to H2 over 96&#160;h of operation.

         <title>Ordered Transfer from 3D&#8208;oriented MOF Superstructures to Polymeric Films: Microfabrication, Enhanced Chemical Stability, and Anisotropic Fluorescent Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Films and patterns of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) afford well&#8208;ordered pore structures extending across centimeter&#8208;scale areas. These macroscopic domains of aligned pores are pivotal to enhance diffusion along specific pathways and orient functional guests. The anisotropic properties emerging from this alignment are beneficial for applications in ion conductivity and photonics. However, the structure of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF films and patterns can rapidly degrade under humid and acidic conditions. Thus, more durable 3D&#8208;ordered porous systems are desired for practical applications. Here, oriented porous polymer films and patterns are prepared by using heteroepitaxially oriented N3&#8208;functionalized MOF films as precursor materials. The film fabrication protocol utilizes an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition on the Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO MOF. The micropatterning protocol exploits the X&#8208;ray sensitivity of azide groups in Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO, enabling selective degradation in the irradiated areas. The masked regions of the MOF film retain their N3&#8208;functionality, allowing for subsequent cross&#8208;linking through azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Subsequent acidic treatment removes the Cu ions from the MOF, yielding porous polymer micro&#8208;patterns. The polymer has high chemical stability and shows an anisotropic fluorescent response. The use of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF systems as precursors for the fabrication of oriented porous polymers will facilitate the progress of optical components for photonic applications.

         <title>Breathable Dual&#8208;Mode Leather&#8208;Like Nanotextile for Efficient Daytime Radiative Cooling and Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breathable dual&#8208;mode leather&#8208;like nanotextile (LNT) is developed via one&#8208;step electrospinning that balances efficient thermal management performance, wearing comfort, and scalability. Designed with bilayer wrinkle microstructures combined with particles, the LNT offers double&#8208;sided leather&#8208;like appearances and superior radiative cooling and heating properties, as well as excellent wearing performances, achieving personal thermal comfort in changing environments.








Abstract
Incorporating passive radiative cooling and heating into personal thermal management has attracted tremendous attention. However, most current thermal management materials are usually monofunctional with a narrow temperature regulation range, and lack breathability, softness, and stretchability, resulting in a poor wearer experience and limited application scenarios. Herein, a breathable dual&#8208;mode leather&#8208;like nanotextile (LNT) with asymmetrical wrinkle photonic microstructures and Janus wettability for highly efficient personal thermal management is developed via a one&#8208;step electrospinning technique. The LNT is synthesized by self&#8208;bonding a hydrophilic cooling layer with welding fiber networks onto a hydrophobic photothermal layer, constructing bilayer wrinkle structures that offer remarkable optical properties, a wetting gradient, and unique textures. The resultant LNT exhibits efficient cooling capacity (22.0&#160;&#176;C) and heating capacity (22.1&#160;&#176;C) under sunlight, expanding the thermal management zone (28.3&#160;&#176;C wider than typical textiles). Additionally, it possesses favorable breathability, softness, stretchability, and sweat&#8208;wicking capability. Actual wearing tests demonstrate that the LNT can provide a comfortable microenvironment for the human body (1.6&#8211;8.0&#160;&#176;C cooler and 1.0&#8211;7.1&#160;&#176;C warmer than typical textiles) in changing weather conditions. Such a wearable dual&#8208;mode LNT presents great potential for personal thermal comfort and opens up new possibilities for all&#8208;weather smart clothing.

         <title>Decoration of Ag Species into Reduced Graphene Oxide Foam as a Superelastic and Robust Host toward Stable Zn Metal Anodes under Dwell&#8208;Fatigue Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag decorated reduced graphene oxide foam (AGF) is designed as a Zn host for Zn metal anodes under dwell&#8208;fatigue condition through a wet&#8208;press dual&#8208;templating assembly strategy. Owing to high mechanical strength and strong synergetic effect, the AGF host demonstrates remarkable superelasticity and robustness. As a result, the AGF@Zn enables stable Zn plating/stripping under normal condition and varying pressures.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;sea equipment usually operates under dwell&#8208;fatigue condition, which means the equipped energy storage devices must survive under the changing pressure. Special mechanical designs should be considered to maintain the electrochemical performance of electrodes under this extreme condition. In this work, an effective assembly strategy is proposed to accommodate the dwell&#8208;fatigue loading using Ag decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) foam (denoted as AGF) as a superelastic and robust Zn host. The wet&#8208;press assembly process enables the formation of highly porous and robust framework. The strong synergetic effect between rGO and Ag further guarantees AGF's superelasticity and ultrahigh mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the homogeneously distributed Ag species on the rGO sheets act as zincophilic sites to effectively facilitate Zn plating. Furthermore, AGF offers enough space to address the expansion during the charge and discharge cycles. As expected, the symmetrical cell using this AGF@Zn host demonstrates a long lifespan over 400&#160;h at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 50%. It is worth mentioning that the superelastic AGF host realizes stable Zn plating/stripping under varying pressures.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanoarchitectonics: Recent Advances for Precious Metal Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for precious metal (PM) recovery, organizing design and synthesis strategies for three types of COF&#8208;based materials. It highlights the selectivity of COFs due to strong interactions with PMs. Importantly, it notes limited research on platinum group elements and real wastewater applications, suggesting future research directions.








Abstract
The recovery of precious metals (PMs) from secondary resources has garnered significant attention due to environmental and economic considerations. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising adsorbents for this purpose, owing to their tunable pore size, facile functionalization, exceptional chemical stability, and large specific surface area. This review provides an overview of the latest research progress in utilizing COFs to recover PMs. Firstly, the design and synthesis strategies of chemically stable COF&#8208;based materials, including pristine COFs, functionalized COFs, and COF&#8208;based composites, are delineated. Furthermore, the application of COFs in the recovery of gold, silver, and platinum group elements is delved into, emphasizing their high adsorption capacity and selectivity as well as recycling ability. Additionally, various interaction mechanisms between COFs and PM ions are analyzed. Finally, the current challenges faced by COFs in the field of PM recovery are discussed, and potential directions for future development are proposed, including enhancing the recyclability and reusability of COF materials and realizing the high recovery of PMs from actual acidic wastewater. With the targeted development of COF&#8208;based materials, the recovery of PMs can be realized more economically and efficiently in the future.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered PROTAC Nanoassemblies for Photodynamic IDO Proteolysis in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces light&#8208;triggered proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) nanoassemblies (LPNs) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis, persistently reprogramming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The LPNs, self&#8208;assembled from prodrug conjugates, deliver PROTACs and photosensitizers to tumor tissues. Subsequently, photodynamic therapy induces immunogenic cell death, while the recyclable action of PROTACs for IDO proteolysis enhances effector&#8208;T&#8208;cell activation and alleviates regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, inhibiting tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.








Abstract
While proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold great potential for persistently reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via targeted protein degradation, precisely activating them in tumor tissues and preventing uncontrolled proteolysis at off&#8208;target sites remain challenging. Herein, a light&#8208;triggered PROTAC nanoassembly (LPN) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis is reported. The LPN is derived from the self&#8208;assembly of prodrug conjugates, which comprise a PROTAC, cathepsin B&#8208;specific cleavable peptide linker, and photosensitizer, without any additional carrier materials. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected LPNs initially silence the activity of PROTACs and accumulate significantly in targeted tumor tissues due to an enhanced permeability and retention effect. Subsequently, the cancer biomarker cathepsin B begins to trigger the release of active PROTACs from the LPNs through enzymatic cleavage of the linkers. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death induced by photodynamic therapy to promote the activation of effector T cells, while the continuous IDO degradation of PROTAC simultaneously blocks tryptophan metabolite&#8208;regulated regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. Such LPN&#8208;mediated combinatorial photodynamic IDO proteolysis effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Collectively, this study presents a promising nanomedicine, designed to synergize PROTACs with other immunotherapeutic modalities, for more effective and safer cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The disorder of the macrophage phenotype and the hostile by&#8208;product of lactate evoked by pathogenic infection in hypoxic deep wound inevitably lead to the stagnant skin regeneration. In this study, we developed H2S&#8208;evolving alternately catalytic bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (AC&#8208;BioHJzyme) consisting of CuFe2S3 and lactate oxidase (CuFe2S3@LOD). AC&#8208;BioHJzyme exhibits circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibacterial (EMA) activity and macrophage re&#8208;rousing capability, which can be activated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) light. In this system, LOD exhausts lactate derived from bacterial anaerobic respiration and generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which provides an abundant stock for the peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activity to convert the produced H2O2 into germicidal &#8226;OH. The GPx&#8208;mimetic activity endows AC&#8208;BioHJzyme with a glutathione consumption property to block the antioxidant systems in bacterial metabolism, while the O2 provided by the CAT&#8208;mimetic activity can generate 1O2 under the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Synchronously, the H2S gas liberated from CuFe2S3@LOD under the infectious micromilieu allows the reduction of Fe(III)/Cu(II) to Fe(II)/Cu(&#1030;), resulting in sustained circular EMA activity. In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that the CuFe2S3@LOD AC&#8208;BioHJzyme significantly facilitates the infectious cutaneous regeneration by killing bacteria, facilitating epithelialization/collagen deposition, promoting angiogenesis and reprogramming macrophages. This study provides a countermeasure for deep infectious wound healing via circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibiosis and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Strategy: Novel Borohydride&#8208;Based Solid Electrolytes Extracted from Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As the core component of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes fail to simultaneously meet multiple demands, such as their own high performance, the chemical, electrochemical and mechanical compatibility of electrode interface. A fresh perspective is rather desired to guide the development of novel solid electrolytes with comprehensive performance. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy to synthesize solid electrolytes extracted from cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), which is inspired by peach trees secreting peach gum to prevent further damage. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, using LiBH4&#8208;Se and LiBH4&#8208;S as prototypes, confirms that as&#8208;synthesized electrolytes inherited and improved up the advantages of LiBH4 with unexpected compatibility towards multiple cathodes. It is believed that the family of new electrolytes will be continuously expanded under the guidance of this CEI&#8208;derived concept.

         <title>An Ultralight Composite Current Collector Enabling High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high energy and power densities, high safety, and excellent flexibility are achieved by using an ultralight composite current collector, which opens a new avenue to pursue high&#8208;performance and high&#8208;safety energy storage.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising alternatives to current Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, the copper (Cu) current collector accounts for more than 25 wt% of the total weight of the anode&#8208;free battery without capacity contribution, which severely reduces the energy and power densities. Here, a new family of ultralight composite current collectors with a low areal density of 0.78&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, representing significant weight reduction of 49%&#8208;91% compared with the Cu&#8208;based current collectors for high&#8208;energy Li batteries, is presented. Rational molecular engineering of the polyacylsemicarbazide substrate enables enhanced interfacial interaction with the sputtered Cu layer, which results in excellent interfacial stability, flexibility, and safety for the obtained anode&#8208;free batteries. The battery&#8208;level energy density has been significantly improved by 36%&#8211;61%, and a maximum rate capability reaches 5 C (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) attributed to the homogeneous Li+ flux and smooth Li deposition on the nanostructured Cu layer. The results not only open a new avenue to improve the energy and power densities of anode&#8208;free batteries via composite current collector innovation but, in a broader context, provide a new paradigm to pursue high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety, and flexible batteries.

         <title>Intrinsically Safe Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Thermo&#8208;electrochemical Compatible in&#8208;situ Polymerized Solid&#8208;state Electrolytes</title>

Abstract
In&#8208;situ polymerized solid&#8208;state electrolytes have attracted much attention due to high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, conformal interface contact, and low interface resistance, but are plagued by lithium dendrite, interface degradation, and inferior thermal stability, which thereby leads to limited lifespan and severe safety hazards for high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose an in&#8208;situ polymerized electrolyte by copolymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane with 1,3,5&#8208;tri glycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) as a cross&#8208;linking agent, which realizes a synergy of battery thermal safety and interface compatibility with Li anode. Functional TGIC enhances the electrolyte polymeric level. The unique carbon&#8208;formation mechanism facilitates flame retardancy and eliminates the battery fire risk. In the meantime, TGIC&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase inhibits interface side reactions and promotes uniform Li plating. Intrinsically safe LMBs with nonflammability and outstanding electrochemical performances under extremely temperatures (130 &#176;C) are achieved. This functional polymer design shows a promising prospect for the development of safe LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;In-situ polymerized solid-state electrolytes have attracted much attention due to high Li-ion conductivity, conformal interface contact, and low interface resistance, but are plagued by lithium dendrite, interface degradation, and inferior thermal stability, which thereby leads to limited lifespan and severe safety hazards for high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose an in-situ polymerized electrolyte by copolymerization of 1,3-dioxolane with 1,3,5-tri glycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) as a cross-linking agent, which realizes a synergy of battery thermal safety and interface compatibility with Li anode. Functional TGIC enhances the electrolyte polymeric level. The unique carbon-formation mechanism facilitates flame retardancy and eliminates the battery fire risk.

         <title>Polymeric Fibers with High Strength and High Toughness at Extreme Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing strong and simultaneously tough polymeric materials with excellent thermal stability and mechanical performance even under extreme temperatures is truly a challenge. In a disruptive progress, we develop continuous polymeric yarns with a combination of high tensile strength of (1145 &#177; 44) MPa and ultra&#8208;high toughness of (350 &#177; 24) J/g and high thermomechanical properties from &#8208;196&#160;&#176;C to 200&#160;&#176;C. The comprehensive thermomechanical performance of this yarn surpasses that of previously developed polymeric materials and dragline spider silks. Our results demonstrate that the molecular structure of polyimide with the incorporation of flexible&#8208;rigid macromolecular, hierarchically spiral&#8208;oriented fibers, and high glass transition temperature (248&#160;&#176;C) are keys for the yarn's notable comprehensive performance in thermomechanical properties. Our materials are ideal for technical components exposed to high thermomechanical loadings, such as those encountered in spacecraft or automotive engineering for safety&#8208;critical applications.

         <title>Reversible Solar Heating and Radiative Cooling Devices via Mecbhanically Guided Assembly of 3D Macro/Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling are promising solutions for decreasing global energy consumption because these strategies use the Sun (&#8764;5800 K) as a heating source and outer space (&#8764;3 K) as a cooling source. Although high&#8208;performance thermal management can be achieved using these eco&#8208;friendly methods, they are limited by daily temperature fluctuations and seasonal changes because of single&#8208;mode actuation. Herein, reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices formed via the mechanically guided assembly of 3D architectures are demonstrated. The fabricated devices exhibit the following properties: (i) The devices reversibly change between solar heating and radiative cooling under uniaxial strain, called dual&#8208;mode actuation. (ii) The 3D platforms in the devices can use rigid/soft materials for functional layers owing to the optimized designs. (iii) The devices can be used for dual&#8208;mode thermal management on a macro/microscale. The devices use black paint&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) films as solar absorbers with multilayered films comprising thin layers of polydimethylsiloxane/silver/PI, achieving heating and cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, mode changes according to the angle of the 3D structures are demonstrated and the heating/cooling performance with skin, glass, steel, aluminum, copper, and PI substrates is investigated.

         <title>Lightweight electrolyte design for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) has recently emerged as a promising cathode for high&#8208;energy Li metal batteries owing to its high capacity, extended cycle life, and liberty from costly transition metals. As the high capacities of both Li metal and SPAN lead to relatively small electrode weights, the weight and specific energy density of Li/SPAN batteries are particularly sensitive to electrolyte weight, highlighting the importance of minimizing electrolyte density. In addition, the large volume changes of Li metal anode and SPAN cathode require inorganic&#8208;rich interphases that can guarantee intactness and protectivity throughout long cycles. This work addresses these crucial aspects with an electrolyte design in which lightweight dibutyl ether (DBE) is used as diluent for concentrated LiFSI&#8208;triethyl phosphate (TEP) solution. The designed electrolyte (d = 1.04&#160;g mL&#8722;1) is 40&#8211;50% lighter than conventional localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs), leading to 12&#8211;20% extra energy density at the cell level. Besides, the use of DBE introduces substantial solvent&#8208;diluent affinity, resulting in a unique solvation structure with strengthened capability to form favorable anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphases, minimize electrolyte consumption, and improve cell cyclability. Our electrolyte also exhibits lower volatility than carbonate electrolytes and offers enhanced protection to both Li metal anode and SPAN cathode under thermal abuse.

         <title>The Rise of Xene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise of Xene hybrids as an emerging new class of materials systems is reviewed for their experimental realization strategies, salient properties, and frontier applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis, and water filtration.








Abstract
Xenes, mono&#8208;elemental atomic sheets, exhibit Dirac/Dirac&#8208;like quantum behavior. When interfaced with other 2D materials such as boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides, and metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides, it enables them with unique physicochemical properties, including structural stability, desirable bandgap, efficient charge carrier injection, flexibility/breaking stress, thermal conductivity, chemical reactivity, catalytic efficiency, molecular adsorption, and wettability. For example, BN acts as an anti&#8208;oxidative shield, MoS2 injects electrons upon laser excitation, and MXene provides mechanical flexibility. Beyond precise compositional modulations, stacking sequences, and inter&#8208;layer coupling controlled by parameters, achieving scalability and reproducibility in hybridization is crucial for implementing these quantum materials in consumer applications. However, realizing the full potential of these hybrid materials faces challenges such as air gaps, uneven interfaces, and the formation of defects and functional groups. Advanced synthesis techniques, a deep understanding of quantum behaviors, precise control over interfacial interactions, and awareness of cross&#8208;correlations among these factors are essential. Xene&#8208;based hybrids show immense promise for groundbreaking applications in quantum computing, flexible electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. In this timely perspective, recent discoveries of novel Xenes and their hybrids are highlighted, emphasizing correlations among synthetic parameters, structure, properties, and applications. It is anticipated that these insights will revolutionize diverse industries and technologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in 3D Printing of Smart Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart scaffolds possess the ability to mimic the extracellular matrix by sensing stimuli and initiating targeted biological reactions and host responses, thereby facilitating bone repair and regeneration. This article systematically reviews stimuli&#8208;responsive strategies, therapeutic efficacy, and applications of 3D&#8208;printed smart scaffolds for bone tissue engineering and regeneration. It also discusses the persisting challenges while providing an outlook on future developments.








Abstract
The repair and functional reconstruction of bone defects resulting from severe trauma, surgical resection, degenerative disease, and congenital malformation pose significant clinical challenges. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) holds immense potential in treating these severe bone defects, without incurring prevalent complications associated with conventional autologous or allogeneic bone grafts. 3D printing technology enables control over architectural structures at multiple length scales and has been extensively employed to process biomimetic scaffolds for BTE. In contrast to inert and functional bone grafts, next&#8208;generation smart scaffolds possess a remarkable ability to mimic the dynamic nature of native extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby facilitating bone repair and regeneration. Additionally, they can generate tailored and controllable therapeutic effects, such as antibacterial or antitumor properties, in response to exogenous and/or endogenous stimuli. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the progress of 3D&#8208;printed smart scaffolds for BTE applications. It begins with an introduction to bone physiology, followed by an overview of 3D printing technologies utilized for smart scaffolds. Notable advances in various stimuli&#8208;responsive strategies, therapeutic efficacy, and applications of 3D&#8208;printed smart scaffolds are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Smart scaffolds possess the ability to mimic the extracellular matrix by sensing stimuli and initiating targeted biological reactions and host responses, thereby facilitating bone repair and regeneration. This article systematically reviews stimuli-responsive strategies, therapeutic efficacy, and applications of 3D-printed smart scaffolds for bone tissue engineering and regeneration. It also discusses the persisting challenges while providing an outlook on future developments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repair and functional reconstruction of bone defects resulting from severe trauma, surgical resection, degenerative disease, and congenital malformation pose significant clinical challenges. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) holds immense potential in treating these severe bone defects, without incurring prevalent complications associated with conventional autologous or allogeneic bone grafts. 3D printing technology enables control over architectural structures at multiple length scales and has been extensively employed to process biomimetic scaffolds for BTE. In contrast to inert and functional bone grafts, next-generation smart scaffolds possess a remarkable ability to mimic the dynamic nature of native extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby facilitating bone repair and regeneration. Additionally, they can generate tailored and controllable therapeutic effects, such as antibacterial or antitumor properties, in response to exogenous and/or endogenous stimuli. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the progress of 3D-printed smart scaffolds for BTE applications. It begins with an introduction to bone physiology, followed by an overview of 3D printing technologies utilized for smart scaffolds. Notable advances in various stimuli-responsive strategies, therapeutic efficacy, and applications of 3D-printed smart scaffolds are discussed. Finally, the review highlights the existing challenges in the development and clinical implementation of smart scaffolds, as well as emerging technologies in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;Area Monolayers and van der Waals Heterostructures of Transition&#8208;Metal Chalcogenides via Assisted Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy of 2D chalcogenides typically yields small, disconnected islands, with premature onset of multilayer formation. This work reports how utilizing excited ions of a sacrificial species during the growth can dramatically enhance nucleation of the epitaxial layer, enabling growth of large&#8208;area monolayers with enhanced carrier lifetimes and facilitating the fabrication of all&#8208;epitaxial van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides include some of the most important and ubiquitous families of 2D materials. They host an exceptional variety of electronic and collective states, which can in principle be readily tuned by combining different compounds in van der Waals heterostructures. Achieving this, however, presents a significant materials challenge. The highest quality heterostructures are usually fabricated by stacking layers exfoliated from bulk crystals, which &#8211; while producing excellent prototype devices &#8211; is time consuming, cannot be easily scaled, and can lead to significant complications for materials stability and contamination. Growth via the ultra&#8208;high vacuum deposition technique of molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE) should be a premier route for 2D heterostructure fabrication, but efforts to achieve this are complicated by non&#8208;uniform layer coverage, unfavorable growth morphologies, and the presence of significant rotational disorder of the grown epilayer. This work demonstrates a dramatic enhancement in the quality of MBE grown 2D materials by exploiting simultaneous deposition of a sacrificial species from an electron&#8208;beam evaporator during the growth. This approach dramatically enhances the nucleation of the desired epi&#8208;layer, in turn enabling the synthesis of large&#8208;area, uniform monolayers with enhanced quasiparticle lifetimes, and facilitating the growth of epitaxial van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Formation and Detriments of Residual Alkaline Compounds on High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;depth analyses on the formation of surface residual alkaline compounds, electrochemical performances, and structural stability of LiNiO2, LiNi0.95Co0.05O2, LiNi0.95Mn0.05O2, and LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 suggest that although Mn&#8208;doping can suppress residual Li formation in high&#8208;Ni cathodes during ambient air storage, the Mn&#8208;doped cathode suffers from more serious impedance growth and reaction heterogeneity due to the formation of spinel&#8208;like M3&#8211;xLixO4 phases.








Abstract
High&#8208;nickel layered oxides LiNixM1&#8208;xO2 (x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.9) have emerged as promising cathode materials for automotive batteries due to their high energy density and lower cost. However, the formation and accumulation of surface alkaline compounds during storage hinder their mass production and commercialization. Here, a validated chemical method is employed to deconvolute and quantify the evolution of each residual lithium compound in four representative cathodes during ambient&#8208;air storage, viz., LiNiO2 (LNO), LiNi0.95Co0.05O2 (NC), LiNi0.95Mn0.05O2 (NM), and LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 (NA). Furthermore, the activation energy of the reaction between water and the cathode is determined by measuring the leached LiOH concentration at various temperatures. While residual lithium and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry measurements collectively reveal that the air stability overall follows the trend of NM&#160;&gt;&#160;NA&#160;&#8776;&#160;NC&#160;&gt;&#160;LNO, the aged NM exhibits the highest charge&#8208;transfer resistance and the worst electrochemical performance among the cathodes. In situ, X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy unveil that the aged NM is plagued by a large area of resistive spinel&#8208;like M3&#8211;xLixO4 phases, leading to aggravated particle reaction heterogeneity. Finally, a one&#8208;step recalcination method is demonstrated effective in fully restoring the degraded cathodes. This work provides insights into overcoming air sensitivity issues of high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Switching Hydrophobic Interface with Ionic Valves for Reversible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric field&#8208;triggered ionic valve strategy is proposed to construct an adaptive hydrophobic interface, which can accommodate the varying demands for interfacial H2O during zinc (Zn) plating/stripping, thereby achieving highly reversible Zn batteries.








Abstract
Developing hydrophobic interface has proven effective in addressing dendrite growth and side reactions during zinc (Zn) plating in aqueous Zn batteries. However, this solution inadvertently impedes the solvation of Zn2+ with H2O and subsequent ionic transport during Zn stripping, leading to insufficient reversibility. Herein, an adaptive hydrophobic interface that can be switched &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; by ionic valves to accommodate the varying demands for interfacial H2O during both the Zn plating and stripping processes, is proposed. This concept is validated using octyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C8TAB) as the ionic valve, which can initiatively establish and remove a hydrophobic interface in response to distinct electric&#8208;field directions during Zn plating and stripping, respectively. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits an extended cycling life of over 2500 h with a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.8%. The full cells also show impressive capacity retention of over 85% after 1&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. These findings provide a new insight into interface design for aqueous metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulation of Cooper&#8208;Pair Tunneling via Domain Structure in a van der Waals Ferromagnetic Josephson Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic Josephson junction is important for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. The NbSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/NbSe2 ferromagnetic Josephson junction shows an unconventional dual&#8208;peak feature in the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent critical supercurrent due to the multidomain structure of the Cr2Ge2Te6 tunnel barrier. This work helps researchers explore the interactions between Ising Cooper pairs and magnetic domains and realize practical magnetic Josephson junction devices.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic Josephson junctions play a key role in understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics. The magnetic domain structures of the ferromagnet in such junctions can significantly affect the tunneling of the superconducting Cooper pairs due to the strong interactions between Cooper pairs and local magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic tunnel barrier. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism of relevant quasiparticle tunneling processes with magnetic domain structures remains largely unexplored. Here, the manipulation of Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling in the NbSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/NbSe2 ferromagnetic Josephson junction is demonstrated by using a multidomain ferromagnetic barrier with anisotropic magnetic moments. The evolution of up&#8208;, down&#8208;magnetized domain and Bloch domain structures in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier under external magnetic fields leads to the enhancement of the critical tunneling supercurrent and an unconventional dual&#8208;peak feature with two local maxima in the field&#8208;dependent critical current curve. The phenomenon of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;modulated critical tunneling supercurrent can be well explained by the competition between the coherence length of tunneling Cooper pairs and the size of magnetic domain walls in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier. This kind of ferromagnetic Josephson junction provides an intriguing material system for manipulating Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling by tuning the local magnetic moments within magnetic Josephson junction devices.

         <title>Tailoring Multi&#8208;Phenyl Ring Cation for Stable Scalable Hybrid Bismuth Iodide Amorphous Film: Enabling Record Sensitivity and High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Array Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, a new multi&#8208;phenyl ring methyltriphenylphosphonium (MTP) is designed to optimize the energy band structure. For the first time, the coupling between the A&#8208;site cation and [Bi2X9]3&#8722; is realized, making it the main contributor to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Further, the preparation of MTP3Bi2I9 amorphous large&#8208;area wafer is achieved by a melt&#8208;quenching method, and further applies to X&#8208;ray array imaging.








Abstract
The 329&#8208;type bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based metal halide (MH) polycrystalline films have potential to be applied in the new generation of X&#8208;ray imaging technology owing to high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficients and excellent detection properties. However, the mutually independent [Bi2X9]3&#8722; units and numerous grain boundaries in the material lead to low carrier transport and collection capabilities, severe ion migration, large dark currents, and poor response uniformity. Here, a new multi&#8208;phenyl ring methyltriphenylphosphonium (MTP) is designed to optimize the energy band structure. For the first time, the coupling between the A&#8208;site cation and [Bi2X9]3&#8722; is realized, making it the main contributor to the conduction band minimum (CBM), getting rid of dilemma that carrier transport is confined to [Bi2X9]3&#8722;. Further, the preparation of MTP3Bi2I9 amorphous large&#8208;area wafer is achieved by melt&#8208;quenching; the steric hindrance effect improves stability, increases ion migration energy, and promotes response uniformity (14%). Moreover, the amorphous structure takes advantage of A&#8208;site cation participation in the conductivity, achieving a record sensitivity (7601 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low dark current (&#8776;0.11 nA) in the field of amorphous X&#8208;ray detection, and features low&#8208;temperature large&#8208;area preparation. Ultimately, designing amorphous array imaging devices that exhibit excellent response uniformity and potential imaging capabilities is succeeded here.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have shown great potential in the application of optoelectronic devices due to their unique molecular properties. Recently, emerging phosphonic acid&#8208;based SAMs, 2&#8208;(9Hcarbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), have successfully applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). More importantly, impressive results based on 2PACz SAMs are reported recently in succession. Therefore, it is essential to provide an insightful summary to promote it further development. In this review, the molecule design strategies about 2PACz are first concluded. Subsequently, this work systematically reviews the recent advances of 2PACz and its derivatives for single junction PSCs, tandem PSCs, OSCs and PeLEDs. Finally, this work concludes and discusses future challenges for 2PACz and its derivatives to further develop in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Arbitrary Construction of Versatile NIR&#8208;Driven Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spin&#8208;coating method creates light&#8208;driven microrobots (LMNRs) using bulk heterojunction organic semiconductor solar cells (OSSC). This technique uniformly coats various structures with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive OSSC, enabling microrobots to move under NIR light. Applications include microplastic removal, cargo transport, and precise, light&#8208;guided motion.








Abstract
Emerging light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) showcase profound potential for sophisticated manipulation and various applications. However, the realization of a versatile and straightforward fabrication technique remains a challenging pursuit. This study introduces an innovative bulk heterojunction organic semiconductor solar cell (OSC)&#8208;based spin&#8208;coating approach, aiming to facilitate the arbitrary construction of LMNRs. Leveraging the distinctive properties of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive organic semiconductor heterojunction solution, this technique enables uniform coating across various dimensional structures (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D) to be LMNRs, denoted as &#8220;motorization.&#8221; The film, with a slender profile measuring &#8776;140&#160;nm in thickness, effectively preserves the original morphology of objects while imparting actuation capabilities exceeding hundreds of times their own weight. The propelled motion of these microrobots is realized through NIR&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;diffusiophoresis, showcasing a versatile array of controllable motion profiles. The strategic customization of arbitrary microrobot construction addresses specific applications, ranging from 0D microrobots inducing living crystal formation to intricate, multidimensional structures designed for tasks such as microplastic extraction, cargo delivery, and phototactic precise maneuvers. This study advances user&#8208;friendly and versatile LMNR technologies, unlocking new possibilities for various applications, signaling a transformative era in multifunctional micro/nanorobot technologies.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Interferometric Sum&#8208;Frequency Imaging of Strongly Coupled Phonon Polaritons in SiC Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;linear technique of infrared + visible sum&#8208;frequency spectro&#8208;microscopy is introduced to image phonon polaritons in SiC metasurfaces. This approach allows for access to both the spatial propagation and spectral dispersion of the polaritons with sub&#8208;wavelength spatial resolution. The hybridization and strong coupling of propagating (SPhP) and localized (LSPhP) phonon polaritons and the activation of polaritonic edge states are observed.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons enable waveguiding and localization of infrared light with extreme confinement and low losses. The spatial propagation and spectral resonances of such polaritons are usually probed with complementary techniques such as near&#8208;field optical microscopy and far&#8208;field reflection spectroscopy. Here, infrared&#8208;visible sum&#8208;frequency spectro&#8208;microscopy is introduced as a tool for spectroscopic imaging of phonon polaritons. The technique simultaneously provides sub&#8208;wavelength spatial resolution and highly&#8208;resolved spectral resonance information. This is implemented by resonantly exciting polaritons using a tunable infrared laser and wide&#8208;field microscopic detection of the upconverted light. The technique is employed to image hybridization and strong coupling of localized and propagating surface phonon polaritons in a metasurface of SiC micropillars. Spectro&#8208;microscopy allows to measure the polariton dispersion simultaneously in momentum space by angle&#8208;dependent resonance imaging, and in real space by polariton interferometry. Notably, it is possible to directly image how strong coupling affects the spatial localization of polaritons, inaccessible with conventional spectroscopic techniques. The formation of edge states is observed at excitation frequencies where strong coupling prevents polariton propagation into the metasurface. The technique is applicable to the wide range of polaritonic materials with broken inversion symmetry and can be used as a fast and non&#8208;perturbative tool to image polariton hybridization and&#160;propagation.

         <title>Biointerface&#8208;Engineered Hybrid Nanovesicles for Targeted Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform combining M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified liposomes is developed, as P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs, exhibiting enhanced cargo&#8208;loading capability and stability. P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs can effectively facilitate oxygen and photosensitizer delivery, achieving in situ engineering of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and alleviation of tumor hypoxia. This approach reprograms tumor microenvironment and suppresses tumor growth, demonstrating a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple&#8208;negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M1&#8208;Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor&#8208;targeting and macrophage&#8208;polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability of M1&#8208;Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle is developed by integrating M1&#8208;Exos with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes (AApt&#8208;Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with&#160;perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA)&#160;and IR780, as P&#8208;I, to construct P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL&#8208;mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM&#8208;engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.

&lt;p&gt;A nanoplatform combining M1-like macrophage-derived exosomes and AS1411 aptamer-modified liposomes is developed, as P-I@M1E/AALs, exhibiting enhanced cargo-loading capability and stability. P-I@M1E/AALs can effectively facilitate oxygen and photosensitizer delivery, achieving in situ engineering of tumor-associated macrophages and alleviation of tumor hypoxia. This approach reprograms tumor microenvironment and suppresses tumor growth, demonstrating a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple-negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1-like macrophage-derived exosomes (M1-Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor-targeting and macrophage-polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug-loading efficiency and stability of M1-Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle is developed by integrating M1-Exos with AS1411 aptamer-conjugated liposomes (AApt-Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with&#160;perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA)&#160;and IR780, as P-I, to construct P-I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P-I@M1E/AAL-mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P-I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P-I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM-engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoxaline (Qx)&#8208;based nonfullerene acceptors (QxNFAs) enable the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells approaching 20%. In order to effectively develop QxNFAs, the advances of QxNFAs are highlighted, the relationships between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance are analyzed, and strategies to the challenges are proposed.








Abstract
In the recent advances of organic solar cells (OSCs), quinoxaline (Qx)&#8208;based nonfullerene acceptors (QxNFAs) have attracted lots of attention and enabled the recorded power conversion efficiency approaching 20%. As an excellent electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, Qx possesses advantages of many modifiable sites, wide absorption range, low reorganization energy, and so on. To develop promising QxNFAs to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, it is necessary to systematically summarize the QxNFAs reported so far. In this review, all the focused QxNFAs are classified into five categories as following: SM&#8208;Qx, YQx, fused&#8208;YQx, giant&#8208;YQx, and polymer&#8208;Qx according to the molecular skeletons. The molecular design concepts, relationships between the molecular structure and optoelectronic properties, intrinsic mechanisms of device performance are discussed in detail. At the end, the advantages of this kind of materials are summed up, the molecular develop direction is prospected, the challenges faced by QxNFAs are given, and constructive solutions to the existing problems are advised. Overall, this review presents unique viewpoints to conquer the challenge of QxNFAs and thus boost OSCs development further toward commercial applications.

         <title>Tailoring Stress&#8211;Strain Curves of Flexible Snapping Mechanical Metamaterial for On&#8208;Demand Mechanical Responses via Data&#8208;Driven Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the realization of spatially and temporally programmable behaviors, a three&#8208;step data&#8208;driven inverse design framework is proposed based on finite element analysis and machine learning to accurately tailor the stress&#8211;strain curves of snapping mechanical metamaterials. Natively coupling nonideal architecture, nonlinear deformation, and nonlinear constitutive model, this framework is also potentially applicable to other responsive mechanical metamaterials with similar nonlinearities.








Abstract
By incorporating soft materials into the architecture, flexible mechanical metamaterials enable promising applications, e.g., energy modulation, and shape morphing, with a well&#8208;controllable mechanical response, but suffer from spatial and temporal programmability towards higher&#8208;level mechanical intelligence. One feasible solution is to introduce snapping structures and then tune their responses by accurately tailoring the stress&#8211;strain curves. However, owing to the strongly coupled nonlinearity of structural deformation and material constitutive model, it is difficult to deduce their stress&#8211;strain curves using conventional ways. Here, a machine learning pipeline is trained with the finite element analysis data that considers those strongly coupled nonlinearities to accurately tailor the stress&#8211;strain curves of snapping metamaterialfor on&#8208;demand mechanical response with an accuracy of 97.41%, conforming well to experiment. Utilizing the established approach, the energy absorption efficiency of the snapping&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based device can be tuned within the accessible range to realize different rebound heights of a falling ball, and soft actuators can be spatially and temporally programmed to achieve synchronous and sequential actuation with a single energy input. Purely relying on structure designs, the accurately tailored metamaterials&#160;increase the devices&#8217; tunability/programmability. Such an approach can potentially extend to similar nonlinear scenarios towards&#160;predictable or intelligent mechanical responses.

         <title>Continuous Solar Energy Conversion Windows Integrating Zinc Anode&#8208;Based Electrochromic Device and IoT System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Integration of solar cells and electrochromic windows offers crucial contributions to green buildings. Solar&#8208;charging zinc anode&#8208;based electrochromic devices (ZECDs) present exciting opportunities for addressing the solar intermittency issue. However, the limited energy storage capacity of ZECDs results in wasted harnessing of solar energy as well as overcharging of ZECDs. Herein, we report spectral&#8208;selective dual&#8208;band ZECDs that continuously transport solar energy to indoor appliances by remotely controlling the repeated bleached&#8208;tinted (i.e., charged&#8208;discharged) cycles during the daytime. Hexagonal phase cesium&#8208;doped tungsten bronze (h&#8208;Cs0.32WO3, CWO) nanocrystals are adopted for dual&#8208;band ZECDs for the first time, due to their remarkable independent control ability of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) light transmittance (&#8710;T = 73.0%, 700&#160;nm; &#8710;T = 83.7%, 1200&#160;nm), and excellent cycling stability (0.8% optical contrast decay at 1200&#160;nm after 10000 cycles). The prototype device (i.e., CWO//Zn//CWO) delivers extraordinary thermal insulation capability, displaying a 10&#160;&#176;C difference between &#8220;bright&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Furthermore, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT) controller to independently control the NIR and VIS lights of the CWO//Zn//CWO window wirelessly with a smartphone, empowering the continuous discharging of the solar&#8208;charged window during the daytime remotely. Such windows represent an intriguing potential technology whose future impact on green buildings may be substantial.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8208;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, we identify and summarize key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

However, as to biosensing applications, the magnetism of LnNPs is so weak that can hardly be employed in target separation. Herein, it is discovered that the magnetism of the LnNPs is highly associated with their concentration in a confined space, enabling aggregation&#8208;augmented magnetism to make them susceptive to a conventional magnet. Accordingly, a magnetic levitation (Maglev) sensing system is designed, in which the target exosomes can specifically introduce paramagnetic LnNPs to the microbeads&#8217; surface, allowing aggregation&#8208;augmented magnetism and further leverage the microbeads&#8217; levitation height in the Maglev device to indicate the target exosomes content. It is demonstrated that this Maglev system can precisely distinguish healthy people's blood samples from those of breast cancer patients. This is the first work to report that LnNPs hold great promise in magnetic separation&#8208;based biological sample sorting, and the LnNP&#8208;permitted Maglev sensing system is proven to be promising for establishing a new generation of biosensing devices.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Scavenging Celastrol&#8208;Cu Nanoparticles Induce Self&#8208;Amplified Cuproptosis for Augmented Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cuproptosis is a novel copper&#8208;dependent programmed cell death. The efficacy of cuproptosis is highly dependent on intracellular copper accumulation and counteracted by a high level of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells. Here, we developed a self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis nanoplatform (Cel&#8208;Cu NP) using celastrol (Cel), a natural product isolated from medical plant. In Cel&#8208;Cu NP, Cel serves as a versatile copper ionophore, exhibiting an ideal coordination capacity towards copper ions without compromising the cuproptosis induction. Notably, Cel can simultaneously scavenge GSH content to amplify cuproptosis. Moreover, this self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis further activates immunogenic cell death (ICD) to elicit robust immune response. Combining with immune checkpoint blockade, Cel&#8208;Cu NP effectively eradicates metastatic tumors in a mouse lung metastasis model. This study provides an efficient nanomedicine by inducing self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis for robust immunotherapy.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;hole&#8208;like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of Two&#8208;dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials was not identified experimentally. Here, we observed the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory (DFT) and tight&#8208;binding calculations were performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

         <title>From Bioreactor to Bulk Rheology: Achieving Scalable Production of Highly Concentrated Circular DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA serves as a model system in polymer physics due to its ability to be obtained as a uniform polymer with controllable topology and non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Currently, a major obstacle in the widespread adoption of DNA is obtaining it on a scale and cost basis that accommodates bulk rheology and high&#8208;throughput screening. To address this, recent advancements in bioreactor&#8208;based plasmid DNA production is coupled with anion exchange chromatography to produce a unified approach to generating gram&#8208;scale quantities of monodisperse DNA. With this method, 1.1 grams of DNA is obtained per batch to generate solutions with concentrations up to 116&#160;mg mL&#8722;1 of uniform supercoiled and relaxed circular plasmid DNA, which is roughly 69 times greater than the overlap concentration. The utility of this method is demonstrated by performing bulk rheology measurements on DNA of different length, topologies, and concentrations at sample volumes up to 1&#160;mL. The measured elastic moduli are orders of magnitude larger than those previously reported for DNA and allowed for the construction of a time&#8208;concentration superposition curve that spans twelve decades of frequency. Ultimately, these results could provide important insights into the dynamics of ring polymers and the nature of highly condensed DNA dynamics.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;induced Disordered Phase of Spinel Oxides for High Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Battery materials with different phases often play a pivotal role in determining their performance. For instance, the disordered phase of spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LNMO) is more appealing as high&#8208;voltage cathode due to its superior electrochemical performance compared to its ordered counterpart. Various methods have been developed to induce a phase transition from an ordered to a disordered structure. However, the resulting materials often suffer from capacity degradation due to the adverse influence of accompanying Mn3+ ions. This study presents the utilization of local magnetic fields generated by a magnetic Fe3O4 shell to induce a disordered phase transition in LNMO at lower temperature, transitioning it from an order state without significantly increasing the Mn3+ content. The pivotal role played by the local magnetic fields is evidenced through comparisons with samples with nonmagnetic Al2O3 shell, samples subjected to sole heat treatment, and samples heat&#8208;treated within magnetic fields. The key finding is that magnetic fields can initiate a radical pair mechanism, enabling the induction of order&#8208;disorder phase transition even at lower temperatures. The disordered spinal LNMO with a magnetic Fe3O4 shell exhibits excellent cycling stability and kinetic properties in electrochemical characterization as a result. This innovation not only unravels the intricate interplay between the disordered phase and Mn3+ content in the cathode spinel but also pioneers the use of magnetic field effects for manipulating material phases.

         <title>Advanced Energy Harvesters and Energy Storage for Powering Wearable and Implantable Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wearable and Implantable Active Medical Devices (WIMDs) are transformative solutions for improving healthcare, offering continuous health monitoring, early disease detection, targeted treatments, personalized medicine, and connected health capabilities. Commercialized WIMDs use primary or rechargeable batteries to power their sensing, actuation, stimulation, and communication functions, and periodic battery replacements of implanted active medical devices pose major risks of surgical infections or inconvenience to users. Addressing the energy source challenge is critical for meeting the growing demand of the WIMD market that is reaching valuations in the tens of billions of dollars. This review presents a critical assessment of recent advances in energy harvesting and storage technologies that can potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements. With a key focus on advanced materials that can close the gaps between WIMDs&#8217; energy needs and the energy that can harnessed by energy harvesters, this review examines the crucial roles of advanced materials in improving the efficiencies of energy harvesters, wireless charging, and energy storage devices. This review concludes by highlighting the key challenges and opportunities in advanced materials necessary to achieve the vision of wearable and implantable active medical devices that are self&#8208;powered, eliminating the risks associated with surgical battery replacement and the inconvenience of frequent manual recharging.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Contact&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Tunable Indium Tin Oxide Interlayer</title>

Abstract
The imperfect charge behavior at the interfaces of perovskite/electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL)/transparent conducting oxide (TCO) limits the further performance improvement of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Herein, we deposited an indium tin oxide interlayer between ETL and TCO to address this issue. Specifically, the interlayer was prepared using an all&#8208;physical and H2O&#8208;free method, electron&#8208;beam evaporation, which can avoid any potential damage to the underlying perovskite and ETL layers. Moreover, the interlayer's composition can be readily tuned by changing the evaporator component, enabling us to regulate the contact resistance and energy&#8208;level alignment of the ETL/TCO interface. Consequently, the resultant perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency of 30.8% (certified 30.3%). Moreover, the device retains 98% of its initial PCE after continuous operation under ambient conditions for 1078 hours, representing one of the most stable and efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.

         <title>Controlling Electroosmosis in Nanopores Without Altering the Nanopore Sensing Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to engineer electroosmotic flow in nanopores is presented. The method does not alter the nanopore constriction, which can be optimized to improve sensing accuracy, providing more flexibility in nanopore design. This new strategy is supported by continuum electrohydrodynamic simulations on simple geometries, atomistic simulations of biological nanopores and reversal potential.








Abstract
Nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule sensing of biomolecules and nanoparticles. The signal coming from the molecule to be analyzed strongly depends on its interaction with the narrower section&#160;of the nanopore (constriction) that may be tailored to increase sensing accuracy. Modifications of nanopore constriction have also been commonly used to induce electroosmosis, that favors the capture of molecules in the nanopore under a voltage bias and independently of their charge. However, engineering nanopores for increasing both electroosmosis and sensing accuracy is challenging. Here it is shown that large electroosmotic flows can be achieved without altering the nanopore constriction. Using continuum electrohydrodynamic simulations, it is found that an external charged ring generates strong electroosmosis in cylindrical nanopores. Similarly, for conical nanopores it is shown that moving charges away from the cone tip still results in an electroosmotic flow (EOF), whose intensity reduces increasing the diameter of the nanopore section&#160;where charges are placed. This paradigm is applied to engineered biological nanopores showing, via atomistic simulations and experiments, that mutations outside the constriction induce a relatively intense electroosmosis. This strategy provides much more flexibility in nanopore design since electroosmosis can be controlled independently from the constriction, which can be optimized to improve sensing&#160;accuracy.

         <title>Conformal Neuromorphic Bioelectronics for Sense Digitalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sense digitalization, the process of transforming sensory experiences into digital data, is an emerging research frontier that links the physical world with human perception and interaction. This field is largely inspired by the adaptability, fault tolerance, robustness, and energy efficiency inherent in biological senses, driving the development of numerous innovative digitalization techniques. Among these techniques, neuromorphic bioelectronics, characterized by biomimetic adaptability, stand out for their seamless bidirectional interactions with biological entities through stimulus&#8208;response and feedback loops, incorporating bio&#8208;neuromorphic intelligence for information exchange. This review illustrates recent progress in sensory digitalization, encompassing not only the digital representation of physical sensations such as touch, light, and temperature, correlating to tactile, visual, and thermal perceptions, but also the detection of biochemical stimuli such as gases, ions, and neurotransmitters, mirroring olfactory, gustatory, and neural processes. It thoroughly examines the material design, device manufacturing, and system integration, offering detailed insights. However, the field faces significant challenges, including the development of new device/system paradigms, forging genuine connections with biological systems, ensuring compatibility with the semiconductor industry, and overcoming the absence of standardization. Looking ahead, the ambition is to realize biocompatible neural prosthetics, exoskeletons, soft humanoid robots, and cybernetic devices that integrate smoothly with both biological tissues and artificial components, bridging the gap between organic and synthetic realms.

         <title>Interfacial Biomacromolecular Engineering Toward Stable Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace amount of Fucoidan is introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to reshape the electric double layer structure of zinc anode via its specific adsorption, which effectively homogenizes the interfacial concentration field and enables a hybrid nucleation and growth mode characterized as nuclei&#8208;rich and space&#8208;confined dense plating. Curbed corrosion and by&#8208;products also contribute to the dendrite&#8208;free Zn chemistry.








Abstract
Interfacial instability within aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) spurs technical obstacles including parasitic side reactions and dendrite failure to reach the practical application standards. Here, an interfacial engineering is showcased by employing a bio&#8208; derived zincophilic macromolecule as the electrolyte additive (0.037 wt%), which features a long&#8208;chain configuration with laterally distributed hydroxyl and sulfate anion groups, and has the propensity to remodel the electric double layer of Zn anodes. Tailored Zn2+&#8208;rich compact layer is the result of their adaptive adsorption that effectively homogenizes the interfacial concentration field, while enabling a hybrid nucleation and growth mode characterized as nuclei&#8208;rich and space&#8208;confined dense plating. Further resonated with curbed corrosion and by&#8208;products, a dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology is achieved. Consequently, the macromolecule&#8208;modified zinc anode delivers over 1250 times of reversible plating/stripping at a practical area capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, as well as a high zinc utilization rate of 85%. The Zn//NH4V4O10 pouch cell with the maximum capacity of 1.02 Ah can be steadily operated at 71.4&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.25 C) with 98.7% capacity retained after 50 cycles, which demonstrates the scale&#8208;up capability and highlights a &#8220;low input and high return&#8221; interfacial strategy toward practical AZBs.

         <title>New Engineering Science Insights into the Electrode Materials Pairing of Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pairing the positive and negative electrodes with their individual dynamic characteristics at a realistic cell level is essential to the practical optimal design of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). However, the complex relationship between the performance data measured for individual electrodes and the two&#8208;electrode cells used in practice often makes an optimal pairing experimentally challenging. Taking advantage of our developed tunable graphene&#8208;based electrodes with controllable structure, we successfully unite experiments with machine learning to generate a large pool of capacitance data for graphene&#8208;based electrode materials with varied slit pore sizes, thicknesses, and charging rates and numerically pair them into different combinations for two&#8208;electrode cells. The results show that the optimal pairing parameters of positive and negative electrodes vary considerably with the operation rate of the cells and are even influenced by the thickness of inactive components. The best&#8208;performing individual electrode does not necessarily result in optimal cell&#8208;level performance. The machine learning&#8208;assisted pairing approach presents much higher efficiency compared with the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach for the optimal design of supercapacitors. The results observed in this work also indicate the call for comprehensive performance data reporting in the electrochemical energy storage field to enable the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques to efficiently translate well&#8208;developed high&#8208;performance individual electrode materials into real energy storage devices.

         <title>Small Additives Make Big Differences: A Review on Advanced Additives for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries, represent a significant advancement in energy storage technology, offering higher energy densities and enhanced safety over traditional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face critical challenges such as lower ionic conductivity, poor stability at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, and dendrite formation, potentially leading to short circuits and battery failure. The introduction of additives into SSEs has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges. A small amount of additives, encompassing a range from inorganic and organic materials to nanostructures, effectively improve ionic conductivity, drawing it nearer to that of their liquid counterparts, and strengthen mechanical properties to prevent cracking of SSEs and maintain stable interfaces. Importantly, they also play a critical role in inhibiting the growth of dendritic Li, thereby enhancing the safety and extending the lifespan of the batteries. In this review, we comprehensively explore the wide variety of additives that have been investigated, emphasizing how they can be effectively incorporated into SSEs. By dissecting the operational mechanisms of these additives, the review hopes to provide valuable insights that can help researchers in developing more effective SSEs, leading to the creation of more efficient and reliable solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Engineering Reinforced Surface Electronic States and Structural Defects of Hierarchical Metal Oxides@Graphene Fibers toward High&#8208;Performance Wearable Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy doped metal oxide/graphene composite fiber toward high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shape supercapacitors via a high&#8208;entropy doping strategy is designed. Due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies, lattice distortions, and optimized electronic structure via high&#8208;entropy doping, the HE&#8208;MO@GF maintains sufficient active sites, fast reaction kinetics, and improved electronic conductivity, thereby guaranteeing supercapacitor with high energy density, specific capacity, cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
Construction advanced fibers with high Faradic activity and conductivity are effective to realize high energy density with sufficient redox reactions for fiber&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs), yet it is generally at the sacrifice of kinetics and structural stability. Here, a high&#8208;entropy doping strategy is proposed to develop high&#8208;energy&#8208;density FESCs based on high&#8208;entropy doped metal oxide@graphene fiber composite (HE&#8208;MO@GF). Due to the synergistic participation of multi&#8208;metal elements via high&#8208;entropy doping, the HE&#8208;MO@GF features abundant oxygen vacancies from introducing various low&#8208;valence metal ions, lattice distortions, and optimized electronic structure. Consequently, the HE&#8208;MO@GF maintains sufficient active sites, a low diffusion barrier, fast adsorption kinetics, improved electronic conductivity, enhanced structural stability, and Faradaic reversibility. Thereinto, HE&#8208;MO@GF presents ultra&#8208;large areal capacitance (3673.74&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performance (1446.78&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) in 6&#160;M KOH electrolyte. The HE&#8208;MO@GF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs also deliver high energy density (132.85&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2), good cycle performance (81.05% of capacity retention after 10,000 cycles), and robust tolerance to sweat erosion and multiple washing, which is woven into the textile to power various wearable devices (e.g., watch, badge and luminous glasses). This high&#8208;entropy strategy provides significant guidance for designing innovative fiber materials and highlights the development of next&#8208;generation wearable energy devices.

         <title>Isomerization Engineering of Solid Additives Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells via Manipulating Molecular Stacking and Aggregation of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization engineering is applied to design and synthesize solid additives. Benefiting from optimized molecular stacking and aggregation by isomeric solid additives, M1&#8208;treated binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule and polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) yield champion efficiencies of 17.57% and 19.70%, respectively, among the highest power conversion efficiencies of OSCs.









Abstract
Morphology control is crucial in achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) and remains a major challenge in the field of OSC. Solid additive is an effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune morphology, however, the mechanism underlying isomeric solid additives on blend morphology and OSC performance is still vague and urgently requires further investigation. Herein, two solid additives based on pyridazine or pyrimidine as core units, M1 and M2, are designed and synthesized to explore working mechanism of the isomeric solid additives in OSCs. The smaller steric hindrance and larger dipole moment facilitate better &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and aggregation in M1&#8208;based active layer. The M1&#8208;treated all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs (ASM OSCs) obtain an impressive efficiency of 17.57%, ranking among the highest values for binary ASM OSCs, with 16.70% for M2&#8208;treated counterparts. Moreover, it is imperative to investigate whether the isomerization engineering of solid additives works in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer OSCs. M1&#8208;treated D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices achieve an exceptional efficiency of 19.70% (certified as 19.34%), among the highest values for OSCs. The work provides deep insights into the design of solid additives and clarifies the potential working mechanism for optimizing the morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of solid additives.

         <title>Fundamental Understanding of the Low Initial Coulombic Efficiency in SiOx Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) hinders the practical application of SiOx anode. This perspective provides valuable insights into the possible causes that fundamentally result in low ICE, based on which the rational design of high ICE SiOx anodes and paves the way toward industrial application of SiOx as the next generation LIB anode.








Abstract
To meet the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), it is imperative to develop next&#8208;generation anode materials. Compared to conventional carbon&#8208;based anodes, Si&#8208;based materials are promising due to their high theoretical capacity and reasonable cost. SiOx, as a Si&#8208;derivative anode candidate, is particularly encouraging for its durable cycling life, the practical application of which is, however, severely hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) that leads to continuous lithium consumption. What is worse, low ICE also easily triggers a terrible chain reaction causing bad cycling stability. To further develop SiOx anode, researchers have obtained in&#8208;depth understandings regarding its working/failing mechanisms so as to further propose effective remedies for low ICE mitigation. In this sense, herein recent studies investigating the possible causes that fundamentally result in low ICE of SiOx, based on which a variety of solutions addressing the low ICE issue are discussed and summarized, are timely summarized. This perspective provides valuable insights into the rational design of high ICE SiOx anodes and paves the way toward industrial application of SiOx as the next generation LIB anode.

         <title>Sophisticated Structural Ceramics Shaped from 3D Printed Hydrogel Preceramic Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to shaping sophisticated structural ceramics is proposed by the retransformation of vat photopolymerization 3D printed hydrogel preceramic. The 3D printed hydrogel preceramic, due to the unique flexible and shape reconfigurable character, achieving reshape repeatedly constructions through circular process from desiccation to rehydration, is readily shaped to various complex 3D ceramic architectures by firstly shape editing and then thermal sintering. This method will bring more innovation to the unsupported and large&#8208;spanning 3D manufacturing of complex shape ceramics.








Abstract
Shaping ceramic materials into sophisticated architecture with 3D hierarchical structure is desirable in multiapplication yet remains challenge due to their brittle and stiff nature. Herein, a new method to achieve ceramic architectures with unsupported and large&#8208;spanning structure by shaping vat photopolymerization 3D printed hydrogel preceramic skeleton with unique flexible and deformable character is proposed. Specifically, the present photopolymerizable hydrogel preceramic achieves one stone, two birds: the photosensitive polymer matrix coupled with ceramic nanoparticles for the first shaping by vat photopolymerization 3D printing and the secondary plasticity of the 3D printed ceramic body through flexible shape deformation of hydrogel networks. Inorganic binder aluminum dihydrogen phosphate serves as hydrogel dispersion medium to achieve ultralow shrinkage photopolymerization ceramic. Compared with conventional polymer&#8208;derived photocuring ceramics, the linear shrinkage of lamina structure is solely 2%, and which of cubic ceramic structure is just 13.3%. More importantly, one 3D printed preceramic is conducted to reshape repeatedly myriad constructions, realizing reusability of intrinsic brittle ceramic, improving manufacturing fault tolerance rate. Finally, a variety of paradigms for ceramic structure applications are proposed toward stereo circuit, biomedicine, and catalytic applications, breaking the limitation of intrinsic brittleness of ceramic in high&#8208;precision manufacturing of complex ceramic devices.

         <title>Advances in Piezoelectret Materials&#8208;Based Bidirectional Haptic Communication Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectret materials belong to emerging flexible piezoelectric materials, and have important applications in constructing bidirectional haptic communication devices. In this review, the advances in materials construction and devices as sensors and actuators for haptic perception and feedback are systematically summarized. For the purpose of improving the overall practicability, the challenges and opportunities for future research are also discussed.








Abstract
Bidirectional haptic communication devices accelerate the revolution of virtual/augmented reality and flexible/wearable electronics. As an emerging kind of flexible piezoelectric materials, piezoelectret materials can effortlessly convert mechanical force into electrical signals and respond to electrical fields in a deformation manner, exhibiting enormous potential in the construction of bidirectional haptic communication devices. Existing reviews on piezoelectret materials primarily focus on flexible energy harvesters and sensors, and the recent development of piezoelectret&#8208;based bidirectional haptic communication devices has not been comprehensively reviewed.

Abstract
Bioelectronics is an exciting field that bridges the gap between physiological activities and external electronic devices, striving for high resolution, high conformability, scalability, and ease of integration. One crucial component in bioelectronics is bioelectrodes, designed to convert neural activity into electronic signals or vice versa. Previously reported bioelectrodes have struggled to meet several essential requirements simultaneously: high&#8208;fidelity signal transduction, high charge injection capability, strain resistance, and multi&#8208;functionality. This work introduces a novel strategy for fabricating superior bioelectrodes by merging multiple charge&#8208;transfer processes. The resulting bioelectrodes offer accurate ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transduction for capturing electrophysiological signals, dependable charge injection capability for neuromodulation, consistent electrode potential for artifact rejection and biomolecule sensing, and high transparency for seamless integration with optoelectronics. Furthermore, the bioelectrode can be designed to be strain&#8208;insensitive by isolating signal transduction from electron transportation. The innovative concept presented in this work holds great promise for extending to other electrode materials and paves the way for the advancement of multimodal bioelectronics.

         <title>Deciphering the Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction Mechanism of LiH in Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique electrochemical decomposition behavior of lithium hydride (LiH) as well as its bulk&#8208;phase transport mechanism, is experimentally revealed through the integration of isotope exchange, isotope tracing, and in situ transmission electron microscopy&#8208;based nanobattery technology. The significantly distinct behavior exhibits by LiH challenging the current understanding of inorganic solid electrolyte interface (SEI) components.








Abstract
Lithium hydride (LiH) has been widely recognized as the critical component of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li batteries. Although the formation mechanism and structural model of LiH in SEI have been extensively reported, the role in electro&#8208;performance of LiH in SEI is still&#160;ambiguous and has proven challenging to explored due to the complicated structure SEI and the lack of advanced in situ experimental technology. In this study, the isotopic exchange experiments combined with isotopic tracer experiments is applied to solidly illustrate the superior conductivity and Li+ conduction behavior of the LiH in natural SEI. Importantly, in situ transmission electron microscopy analysis is utilized to visualize the self&#8208;electrochemical decomposition of LiH, which is significantly distinctive from LiF and Li2O. The critical experimental evidence discovered by the work demonstrates ion transport behaviors of key components in the SEI, which is imperative for designing novel SEI and augurs a new area in optimizing the performance of lithium batteries.

         <title>20.2% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics Employing a &#960;&#8208;Extension Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptor with Ordered Arrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based acceptor, SMA, is designed and synthesized successfully. SMA possesses highly ordered face&#8208;on orientation and strong aggregation propensity. After addition of 10% SMA into the host materials of PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, the ternary devices realize a champion efficiency of 20.22% with optimized morphology, suppressed charge recombination and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination.








Abstract
Organic solar cells, as a cutting&#8208;edge sustainable renewable energy technology, possess a myriad of potential applications, while the bottleneck problem of less than 20% efficiency limits the further development. Simultaneously achieving an ordered molecular arrangement, appropriate crystalline domain size, and reduced nonradiative recombination poses a significant challenge and is pivotal for overcoming efficiency limitations. This study employs a dual strategy involving the development of a novel acceptor and ternary blending to address this challenge. A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, SMA, characterized by a highly ordered arrangement and high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, is synthesized. By incorporating SMA as a guest acceptor in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, it is observed that SMA staggered the liquid&#8208;solid transition of donor and acceptor, facilitating acceptor crystallization and ordering while maintaining a suitable domain size. Furthermore, SMA optimized the vertical morphology and reduced bimolecular recombination. As a result, the ternary device achieved a champion efficiency of 20.22%, accompanied by increased voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor. Notably, a stabilized efficiency of 18.42% is attained for flexible devices. This study underscores the significant potential of a synergistic approach integrating acceptor material innovation and ternary blending techniques for optimizing bulk heterojunction morphology and photovoltaic performance.

This review summarizes recent research achievements and key challenges facing single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. The new strategies to address these challenges including increasing intrinsic activity of metal sites, enhancing the utilization of metal sites, improving the stability, optimizing the local environment, developing new fabrication techniques, leveraging insights from theoretical studies, and expanding potential applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs) are a class of promising materials for driving electrochemical energy conversion reactions due to their intrinsic advantages, including maximum metal utilization, well&#8208;defined active structures, and strong interface effects. However, SACs have not reached full commercialization for broad industrial applications. This review summarizes recent research achievements in the design of SACs for crucial electrocatalytic reactions on their active sites, coordination, and substrates, as well as the synthesis methods. The key challenges facing SACs in activity, selectivity, stability, and scalability, are highlighted. Furthermore, it is pointed out the new strategies to address these challenges including increasing intrinsic activity of metal sites, enhancing the utilization of metal sites, improving the stability, optimizing the local environment, developing new fabrication techniques, leveraging insights from theoretical studies, and expanding potential applications. Finally, the views are offered on the future direction of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis toward commercialization.

         <title>Inner Doping of Carbon Nanotubes with Perovskites for Ultralow Power Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are doped by filling with 1D halide perovskites to form CsPbBr3/CNT coaxial heterojunctions. Not only can stable n&#8208;type&#8208;doped CNT field&#8208;effect transistors be achieved, but also, a quasi&#8208;broken&#8208;gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field&#8208;effect transistor (TFET) can be constructed. The optimized quasi&#8208;BG TFET exhibits a subthreshold swing of 35 mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature. It paves the way for constructing high&#8208;performance and ultralow power consumption integrated circuits.








Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as the most promising channel material to construct ultrascaled field&#8208;effect transistors, but the perfect sp2 C&#9472;C structure makes stable doping difficult, which limits the electrical designability of CNT devices. Here, an inner doping method is developed by filling CNTs with 1D halide perovskites to form a coaxial heterojunction, which enables a stable n&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor for constructing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor electronics. Most importantly, a quasi&#8208;broken&#8208;gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field&#8208;effect transistor (TFET) is first demonstrated based on an individual partial&#8208;filling CsPbBr3/CNT and exhibits a subthreshold swing of 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with a high on&#8208;state current of up to 4.9&#160;&#181;A per tube and an on/off current ratio of up to 105 at room temperature. The quasi&#8208;BG TFET based on the CsPbBr3/CNT coaxial heterojunction paves the way for constructing high&#8208;performance and ultralow power consumption integrated circuits.

&lt;p&gt;Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as the most promising channel material to construct ultrascaled field-effect transistors, but the perfect sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&#9472;C structure makes stable doping difficult, which limits the electrical designability of CNT devices. Here, an inner doping method is developed by filling CNTs with 1D halide perovskites to form a coaxial heterojunction, which enables a stable n-type field-effect transistor for constructing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor electronics. Most importantly, a quasi-broken-gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is first demonstrated based on an individual partial-filling CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNT and exhibits a subthreshold swing of 35&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high on-state current of up to 4.9&#160;&#181;A per tube and an on/off current ratio of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. The quasi-BG TFET based on the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CNT coaxial heterojunction paves the way for constructing high-performance and ultralow power consumption integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Nucleation and Oriented Crystallization of Methylammonium&#8208;Free Perovskites via In Situ Generated 2D Perovskite Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D&#8208;ACG strategy is developed to control the nucleation and crystallization of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite films. This involves utilizing in situ generated and embedded 2D perovskite as a template, thereby inducing perovskite growth. Consequently, the PSCs based on this strategy achieved an impressive efficiency of 26.16% (certified at 25.84%) along with superior film and device stability.








Abstract
Enhancing stability while maintaining high efficiency is among the primary challenges in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a crystal growth technique assisted by in situ generated 2D perovskite phases has been developed to construct high&#8208;quality 2D/3D perovskite films. The in situ generated 2D perovskite serve as templates for regulating the nucleation and oriented crystal growth in the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;rich film. This led to a high film quality with much reduced trap density and an ultralong carrier lifetime. The obtained perovskite film shows excellent stability under extreme environment conditions (T = 200 &#176;C, RH = 75 &#177; 5%). The corresponding PSC achieved an efficiency of 26.16% (certified 25.84%), along with excellent operational stability (T93 &gt; 1300 h, T &#8773; 50&#160;&#176;C) as well as outstanding high and low temperature cycle stability.

         <title>Spontaneous Supercrystal Formation During a Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a thin epitaxially strained film of a Mott insulator, a hierarchical anisotropic supercrystal is found below metal&#8211;insulator transition temperature (top). A different anisotropic structure is observed at temperatures above (bottom). An electronic anisotropy correlated with the supercrystal is discovered, switching preferential conductivity direction by 90&#176;.








Abstract
Mott metal&#8211;insulator transitions possess electronic, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient electronics. A previously unknown, hierarchically ordered, and anisotropic supercrystal state is reported and its intrinsic formation characterized&#160;in&#8208;situ during a Mott transition in a Ca2RuO4 thin film. Machine learning&#8208;assisted X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction together with cryogenic electron microscopy reveal multi&#8208;scale periodic domain formation at and below the film transition temperature (TFilm&#160;&#8776;&#160;200&#8211;250&#160;K) and a separate anisotropic spatial structure at and above TFilm. Local resistivity measurements imply an intrinsic coupling of the supercrystal orientation to the material's anisotropic conductivity. These findings add a new degree of complexity to the physical understanding of Mott transitions, opening opportunities for designing materials with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Immunogenicity of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great potential as next&#8208;generation therapeutics and drug delivery systems. This article discusses factors influencing the immunogenicity of EVs, including origin, size, endogenous and exogenous content, production and storage methods, dosage, infusion rate, and the biomolecular corona. Strategies to mitigate immunogenicity are proposed, offering valuable insights for future clinical applications of EVs.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics and drug delivery systems due to demonstrated safety and efficacy in preclinical models and early&#8208;stage clinical trials. There is an urgent need to address the immunogenicity of EVs (beyond the apparent lack of immunotoxicity) to advance clinical development. To date, few studies have assessed unintended immunological recognition of EVs. An in&#8208;depth understanding of EV&#8208;induced immunogenicity and clearance is necessary to develop effective therapeutic strategies, including approaches to mitigate immunological recognition when undesired. This article summarizes various factors involved in the potential immunogenicity of EVs and strategies to reduce immunological recognition for improved therapeutic benefit.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Cardiac Monitoring Capsule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;free cardiac monitoring capsule is developed as a zero&#8208;power device implanted in animal models&#8217; cardiac cavity through minimally invasive intervention. It enables continuous and accurate monitoring of cardiac contractility in situ, providing a stable signal, which may contribute to a new option for early diagnosis of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients often fail to recognize the early signs of CVDs, which display irregularities in cardiac contractility and may ultimately lead to heart failure. Therefore, continuously monitoring the abnormal changes in cardiac contractility may represent a novel approach to long&#8208;term CVD surveillance. Here, a zero&#8208;power consumption and implantable bias&#8208;free cardiac monitoring capsule (BCMC) is introduced based on the triboelectric effect for cardiac contractility monitoring in situ. The output performance of BCMC is improved over 10 times with nanoparticle self&#8208;adsorption method. This device can be implanted into the right ventricle of swine using catheter intervention to detect the change of cardiac contractility and the corresponding CVDs. The physiological signals can be wirelessly transmitted to a mobile terminal for analysis through the acquisition and transmission module. This work contributes to a new option for precise monitoring and early diagnosis of CVDs.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance in Vacancy&#8208;Filling Heuslers due to Kondo&#8208;Like Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrate that intrinsic magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal coupling can enhance the thermoelectric performance. The vacancy&#8208;filling Heusler alloy Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCrxSb shows a Kondo&#8208;like effect, which not only increases the effective mass but also reduces the thermal conductivity. As a result, a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of 1.21 is achieved at 973 K in Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCr0.1Sb.








Abstract
To improve thermoelectric efficiency, various tactics have been employed with considerable success to decouple intertwined material attributes. However, the integration of magnetism, derived from the unique spin characteristic that other methods cannot replicate, has been comparatively underexplored and presents an ongoing intellectual challenge. A previous research has shown that vacancy&#8208;filling Heuslers offer a highly adaptable framework for modulating thermoelectric properties. Here, it is demonstrated how intrinsic magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal coupling can enhance the thermoelectric performance of vacancy&#8208;filling Heusler alloys. The materials, Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCrxSb with 0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.1, feature a fraction of magnetic Cr ions that randomly occupy the vacancy sites of the Nb0.75Ti0.25FeSb half&#8208;Heusler matrix. These alloys achieve a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of 1.21 at 973 K, owing to increased Seebeck coefficient and decreased thermal conductivity. The mechanism is primarily due to the introduction of magnetism, which increases the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass (reaching levels up to 15 times that of a free electron's mass) and simultaneously reduces the electronic thermal conductivity. Mass and strain&#8208;field fluctuations further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Even higher zT values can potentially be achieved by carefully balancing electron mobility and effective mass. This work underscores the substantial prospects for exploiting magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal synergies in cutting&#8208;edge thermoelectric materials.

The materials, Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;FeCr&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sb with 0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#8804; 0.1, feature a fraction of magnetic Cr ions that randomly occupy the vacancy sites of the Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;FeSb half-Heusler matrix. These alloys achieve a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;) of 1.21 at 973 K, owing to increased Seebeck coefficient and decreased thermal conductivity. The mechanism is primarily due to the introduction of magnetism, which increases the density-of-states effective mass (reaching levels up to 15 times that of a free electron's mass) and simultaneously reduces the electronic thermal conductivity. Mass and strain-field fluctuations further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Even higher &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; values can potentially be achieved by carefully balancing electron mobility and effective mass. This work underscores the substantial prospects for exploiting magnetic-electrical-thermal synergies in cutting-edge thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Bio&#8208;Voltage Operated Humidity&#8208;Sensory Neurons Comprising Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports low&#8208;power humidity&#8208;sensing neurons comprising biomimetic peptide memristors in which self&#8208;assembled nanowire promotes proton&#8208;coupled Ag+ transport, ultralow&#8208;power operation, and humidity&#8208;dependent conductance control. This bioinspired design encodes humidity into neural spikes, showing 92.68% accuracy in lung&#8208;disease diagnosis using a spiking neural network.








Abstract
Biomimetic humidity sensors offer a low&#8208;power approach for respiratory monitoring in early lung&#8208;disease diagnosis. However, balancing miniaturization and energy efficiency remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by introducing a bioinspired humidity&#8208;sensing neuron comprising a self&#8208;assembled peptide nanowire (NW) memristor with unique proton&#8208;coupled ion transport. The proposed neuron shows a low Ag+ activation energy owing to the NW and redox activity of the tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208;rich peptide in the system, facilitating ultralow electric&#8208;field&#8211;driven threshold switching and a high energy efficiency. Additionally, Ag+ migration in the system can be controlled by a proton source owing to the hydrophilic nature of the phenolic hydroxyl group in Tyr, enabling the humidity&#8208;based control of the conductance state of the memristor. Furthermore, a memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic perception neuron that can encode humidity signals into spikes is proposed. The spiking characteristics of this neuron can be modulated to emulate the strength&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;frequency characteristics of biological neurons. A three&#8208;layer spiking neural network with input neurons comprising these highly tunable humidity perception neurons shows an accuracy of 92.68% in lung&#8208;disease diagnosis. This study paves the way for developing bioinspired self&#8208;assembly strategies to construct neuromorphic perception systems, bridging the gap between artificial and biological sensing and processing paradigms.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;induced Magnet&#8208;free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), we demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix L&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Large Non&#8208;Hysteretic Volume Magnetostriction in a Strong and Ductile High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid development of smart technologies poses a big challenge for magnetostrictive materials, which should not only permit isotropic and hysteresis&#8208;free actuation (i.e., non&#8208;hysteretic volume change) in magnetic fields, but also have high strength and high ductility. Unfortunately, the magnetostriction from self&#8208;assembly of ferromagnetic domains is volume&#8208;conserving; the volume magnetostriction from field&#8208;induced first&#8208;order phase transition has large intrinsic hysteresis; and most prototype magnetostrictive materials are intrinsically brittle. Here we report a magnetic high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) Fe35Co35Al10Cr10Ni10 that can rectify these challenges, exhibiting an unprecedented combination of large non&#8208;hysteretic volume magnetostriction, high tensile strength and large elongation strain, over a wide working temperature range from room temperature down to 100 K. Its exceptional properties stem from a dual&#8208;phase microstructure, where the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) matrix phase with nano&#8208;scale compositional and structural fluctuations can enable a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced transition from low&#8208;spin small&#8208;volume state to high&#8208;spin large&#8208;volume state, and the ordered body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) B2 phase contributes to mechanical strengthening. The present findings may provide insights into designing unconventional and technologically&#8208;important magnetostrictive materials.

         <title>A Novel PiGF@diamond Color Converter with a Record Thermal Conductivity for Laser&#8208;Driven Projection Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;brightness laser lighting is confronted with crucial challenges in developing laser&#8208;excitable color converting materials with effective heat dissipation and super optical performance. Herein, a novel composite of phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;glass film on transparent diamond (PiGF@diamond) is designed and fabricated via a facile low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;sintering strategy. The as&#8208;prepared La3Si6N11: Ce3+ (LSN: Ce) PiGF@diamond with well retained optical properties of raw phosphor shows a record thermal conductivity (TC) of &#8764;599 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, which is about 60 times higher than that of currently well&#8208;used PiGF@sapphire (&#8764;10 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1). As a consequence, this color converter can bear laser power density (LPD) up to 40.24 W&#183;mm&#8722;2 and a maximum luminance flux (LF) of 5602&#160;lm without luminescence saturation due to efficient inhibition of laser&#8208;induced heat accumulation. By further supplementing red spectral component of CaAlSiN3: Eu2+ (CASN: Eu), the PiGF@diamond based white laser diode (wLD) is successfully constructed, which can yield warm white light with a high color rendering index (CRI) of 89.3 and find practical LD&#8208;driven applications. The findings will pave the way for realizing the commercial application of PiGF composite in laser lighting and display.

As a consequence, this color converter can bear laser power density (LPD) up to 40.24 W&#183;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum luminance flux (LF) of 5602&#160;lm without luminescence saturation due to efficient inhibition of laser-induced heat accumulation. By further supplementing red spectral component of CaAlSiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CASN: Eu), the PiGF@diamond based white laser diode (wLD) is successfully constructed, which can yield warm white light with a high color rendering index (CRI) of 89.3 and find practical LD-driven applications. The findings will pave the way for realizing the commercial application of PiGF composite in laser lighting and display.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fast&#8208;charging Anode Materials for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have undergone rapid development as a complementary technology to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to abundant sodium resources. However, the extended charging time and low energy density pose a significant challenge to the widespread use of SIBs in electric vehicles. To overcome this hurdle, there is considerable focus on developing fast&#8208;charging anode materials with rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and superior reaction kinetics. In this Review, the key factors that limit the fast&#8208;charging of anode materials are examined, which provides a comprehensive overview of the major advances and fast&#8208;charging characteristics across various anode materials. Specifically, it systematically dissects considerations to enhance the rate performance of anode materials, encompassing aspects such as porous engineering, electrolyte desolvation strategies, electrode/electrolyte interphase, electronic conductivity/ion diffusivity, and pseudocapacitive ion storage. Finally, the direction and prospects for developing fast&#8208;charging anode materials of SIBs are also proposed, aiming to provide a valuable reference for the further advancement of high&#8208;power SIBs.

         <title>Uniform, Fully Connected, High&#8208;quality Monocrystalline Freestanding Perovskite Oxide Films Fabricated from Recyclable Substrates</title>

Abstract
Releasing epitaxial perovskite oxide films from their native oxide substrates produces high quality, two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;material&#8208;like monocrystalline freestanding oxide membranes, as potential key components for the next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Two major obstacles still limit their practical applications: macroscopic material defects (mainly cracks) that lowers uniformity and yield, and the high cost of the consumed oxide substrates. Here, a two&#8208;step film transfer method and a substrate recycling method enable repetitive fabrication of millimeter&#8208;scale, fully&#8208;connected freestanding oxide films of various chemical compositions from the same substrates; arrays of capacitor and resistor devices based on these oxides transferred on silicon indicate high uniformity, low sample&#8208;to&#8208;sample variation and satisfactory electrical connectivity. The two&#8208;step transfer suppresses crack formation by avoiding buckling&#8208;delamination&#8208;type relaxation of epitaxial strain, and the key point to achieve substrate reuse is to remove the residual Al species bonded to the substrate surfaces. The mitigation of such long&#8208;lasting issues in freestanding oxide fabrication techniques may eventually pave roads towards future industrial&#8208;grade devices, as well as enabling many research opportunities in fundamental physics.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Level Tandem Catalysis in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem behaviors of Li(solvents)x+ and corresponding Li+/Li0 diffusion are initially proposed on lithium metal batteries, leading to huge reaction/diffusion barriers with slow electrochemical kinetics. High&#8208;efficiency single atom catalysts are presented in conversion&#8208;type lithium sulfur batteries ranging from dissociation, transfer, and &#8220;reaction&#8221; barriers at the electrode interior or surface, where Li+ acts as tandem bridge. Lastly, the core issues and future directions of atom&#8208;level catalysis on tandem reaction&#8208;based batteries are assessed.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are limited by reaction or diffusion barriers with dissatisfactory electrochemical kinetics. Typical conversion&#8208;type lithium sulfur battery systems exemplify the kinetic challenges. Namely, before diffusing or reacting in the electrode surface/interior, the Li(solvent)x+ dissociation at the interface to produce isolated Li+, is usually a prerequisite fundamental step either for successive Li+ &#8220;reduction&#8221; or for Li+ to participate in the sulfur conversions, contributing to the related electrochemical barriers. Thanks to the ideal atomic efficiency (100 at%), single atom catalysts (SACs) have gained attention for use in LMBs toward resolving the issues caused by the five types of barrier&#8208;restricted processes, including polysulfide/Li2S conversions, Li(solvent)x+ desolvation, and Li0 nucleation/diffusion. In this perspective, the tandem reactions including desolvation and reaction or plating and corresponding catalysis behaviors are introduced and analyzed from interface to electrode interior. Meanwhile, the principal mechanisms of highly efficient SACs in overcoming specific energy barriers to reinforce the catalytic electrochemistry are discussed. Lastly, the future development of high&#8208;efficiency atomic&#8208;level catalysts in batteries is presented.

         <title>An Electro&#8208;Optical Kerr Device Based on 2D Boron Nitride Liquid Crystals for Solar&#8208;Blind Communications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal boron nitride liquid crystal exhibits robust ultraviolet stability and a record&#8208;high specific electro&#8208;optical Kerr coefficient, which enables fabricate transmissive and stable electro&#8208;optical Kerr modulators for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet light modulation. Based on the modulators, an M&#8208;ary coding array is demonstrated for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet communication.








Abstract
Achieving light modulation in the spectral range of 200&#8211;280 nm is a prerequisite for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet communication, where current technologies are mainly based on the electro&#8208;luminescent self&#8208;modulation of the ultraviolet source. External light modulation through the electro&#8208;birefringence control of liquid crystal (LC) devices has shown success in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared regions. However, the poor stability of conventional LCs against ultraviolet irradiation and their weak electro&#8208;optical response make it challenging to modulate ultraviolet light. Here, an external ultraviolet light modulator is demonstrated using two&#8208;dimensional boron nitride LC. It exhibits robust ultraviolet stability and a record&#8208;high specific electro&#8208;optical Kerr coefficient of 5.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2 m V&#8722;2, being three orders of magnitude higher than those of other known electro&#8208;optical media that are transparent (or potentially transparent) in the ultraviolent spectral range. The sensitive response enables fabricating transmissive and stable ultraviolet&#8208;C electro&#8208;optical Kerr modulators for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet light. An M&#8208;ary coding array with high transmission density is also demonstrated for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet communication.

         <title>Minimally Invasive Delivery of Percutaneous Ablation Agent via Magnetic Colloidal Hydrogel Injection for Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic colloidal hydrogel, constructed from a binary system of biocompatible Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles, exhibits excellent injectability and remarkable magnetically induced heating performance. Functioning as an ablation agent, the hydrogel presents the potential to integrate magnetic&#8208;medium&#8208;mediated hyperthermia therapy with minimally invasive implantation procedures, thereby introducing a novel strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Percutaneous thermotherapy, a minimally invasive operational procedure, is employed in the ablation of deep tumor lesions by means of target&#8208;delivering heat. Conventional thermal ablation methods, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, to a certain extent, are subjected to extended ablation time as well as biosafety risks of unwanted overheating. Given its effectiveness and safety, percutaneous thermotherapy gains a fresh perspective, thanks to magnetic hyperthermia. In this respect, an injectable&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;construct&#8208;based thermal ablation agent is likely to be a candidate for the aforementioned clinical translation. Adopting a simple and environment&#8208;friendly strategy, a magnetic colloidal hydrogel injection is introduced by a binary system comprising super&#8208;paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles. The colloidal hydrogel constructs, unlike conventional bulk hydrogel, can be easily extruded through a percutaneous needle and then self&#8208;heal in a reversible manner owing to the unique electrostatic cross&#8208;linking. The introduction of magnetic building blocks is exhibited with a rapid magnetothermal response to an alternating magnetic field. Such hydrogel injection is capable of generating heat without limitation of deep penetration. The materials achieve outstanding therapeutic results in mouse and rabbit models.

     alt="Minimally Invasive Delivery of Percutaneous Ablation Agent via Magnetic Colloidal Hydrogel Injection for Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnetic colloidal hydrogel, constructed from a binary system of biocompatible Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles, exhibits excellent injectability and remarkable magnetically induced heating performance. Functioning as an ablation agent, the hydrogel presents the potential to integrate magnetic-medium-mediated hyperthermia therapy with minimally invasive implantation procedures, thereby introducing a novel strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percutaneous thermotherapy, a minimally invasive operational procedure, is employed in the ablation of deep tumor lesions by means of target-delivering heat. Conventional thermal ablation methods, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, to a certain extent, are subjected to extended ablation time as well as biosafety risks of unwanted overheating. Given its effectiveness and safety, percutaneous thermotherapy gains a fresh perspective, thanks to magnetic hyperthermia. In this respect, an injectable- and magnetic-hydrogel-construct-based thermal ablation agent is likely to be a candidate for the aforementioned clinical translation. Adopting a simple and environment-friendly strategy, a magnetic colloidal hydrogel injection is introduced by a binary system comprising super-paramagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles. The colloidal hydrogel constructs, unlike conventional bulk hydrogel, can be easily extruded through a percutaneous needle and then self-heal in a reversible manner owing to the unique electrostatic cross-linking. The introduction of magnetic building blocks is exhibited with a rapid magnetothermal response to an alternating magnetic field. Such hydrogel injection is capable of generating heat without limitation of deep penetration. The materials achieve outstanding therapeutic results in mouse and rabbit models. These findings constitute a new class of locoregional interventional thermal therapies with minimal collateral damages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Natural, Organic Emitters and Their Application in Industrially Compostable Programmable Luminescent Tags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design is presented for programmable luminescent tags fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use materials allowing for waste&#8208;free information storage. Cinchonine embedded in polylactic acid as host material provides sufficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for easy readout even under continuous&#8208;wave illumination. Exceval is used as oxygen blocking layer to locally control the oxygen&#8208;sensitive RTP emission for high&#8208;resolution writing of information.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors provide the potential of biodegradable technologies, but prototypes do only rarely exist. Transparent, ultrathin programmable luminescent tags (PLTs) are presented for minimalistic yet efficient information storage that are fully made from biodegradable or at least industrially compostable, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use materials (bioPLTs). As natural emitters, the quinoline alkaloids show sufficient room temperature phosphorescence when being embedded in polymer matrices with cinchonine exhibiting superior performance. Polylactic acid provides a solution for both the matrix material and the flexible substrate. Room temperature phosphorescence can be locally controlled by the oxygen concentration in the film by using Exceval as additional oxygen blocking layers. These bioPLTs exhibit all function&#8208;defining characteristics also found in their regular nonenvironmentally degradable analogs and, additionally, provide a simplified, high&#8208;contrast readout under continuous&#8208;wave illumination as a consequence of the unique luminescence properties of the natural emitter cinchonine. Limitations for flexible devices arise from limited thermal stability of the polylactic acid foil used as substrate allowing only for one writing cycle and preventing an annealing step during fabrication. Few&#8208;cycle reprogramming is possible when using the architecture of the bioPLTs on regular quartz substrates. This work realizes the versatile platform of PLTs with less harmful materials offering more sustainable use in future.

         <title>Earthworm&#8208;Inspired Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC Nanofibrous Electrocatalyst with Confined Channels for Enhanced ORR/OER Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy through gas&#8208;assisted treatment is proposed for fabricating a nanofibrous bifunctional electrocatalyst with confined channels, cobalt&#8208;based heterojunction nanoparticles and enriched N, S heteroatoms. The controllable regulation of the internal channels comes from the spontaneous migration of cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles with the help of CO2. The synergetic effect of heterojunction, hierarchical nanochannels, and highly&#8208;exposed heteroatoms contributes to efficient ORR/OER electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The rational construction of highly active and durable oxygen&#8208;reactive electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) plays a critical role in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. It is pivotal to achieve optimal utilization of electrocatalytically active sites and valid control of the high specific internal surface area. Inspiration for designing electrocatalysts can come from nature, as it is full of precisely manipulated and highly efficient structures. Herein, inspired by earthworms fertilizing soil, a 3D carbon nanofibrous electrocatalyst with multiple interconnected nanoconfined channels, cobalt&#8208;based heterojunction active particles and enriched N, S heteroatoms (Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC with confined channels) is rationally designed, showing superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte, even outperforming that of benchmark Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalyst. This work demonstrates a new method for porous structural regulation, in which the internal confined channels within the nanofibers are controllably formed by the spontaneous migration of cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles under a CO2 atmosphere. Theoretical analysis reveals that constructing Co/Co3O4/CoF2@NSC electrocatalyst with confined channels can greatly adjust the electron distribution, effectively lower the reaction barrier of inter&#8208;mediate and reduce the OER/ORR overpotential. This work introduces a novel and nature&#8208;inspired strategy for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with well&#8208;designed architectures.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Nanocoatings with Active and Angle&#8208;Independent Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework nanocoatings with meta&#8208;structured textures can endow different substrates, ranging from rigid glass to flexible elastomers, with tailorable angle&#8208;independent structural coloration. This nanocoating can respond to multiple stimuli like gaseous molecule and mechanical deformation with multiple modes, such as real&#8208;time color changing and reversible deformation.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocoatings not only protect and enhance substrate materials but also offer additional functionalities. This demands a sophisticated coordination of the coating's inherent properties and microstructural features. Here, a multifunctional active nanocoating via meta&#8208;structural engineering of covalent organic framework (COF) deposition materials is presented. This COF nanocoating, characterized by well&#8208;defined micropores (1&#8211;2&#160;nm), meta&#8208;structured textures (30&#8211;300&#160;nm), tailored thickness (100&#8211;300&#160;nm), and good uniformness, showcases a unique combination of angle&#8208;independent structural coloration and ultrafast responsiveness to gaseous stimuli. Remarkably, it demonstrates good compatibility with a wide range of inert substrate materials, from rigid ones like glass and metal to flexible elastomers and nanomaterial films of various shapes and sizes. This versatility enables the facile development of devices that can optically report information about their environments. Examples include chemically active coatings with ultrafast (&#8776;10&#160;ms) color&#8208;changing behaviors and programmable actuation behaviors upon exposure to gaseous stimuli, and mechanically active coatings that can detect substrate strain up to 50% yet maintain structural robustness and consistent coloration hue. It is believed that meta&#8208;structural engineering of COF nanocoatings on inert substrates can enable them to respond to environmental stimuli, potentially indicating a new trend in developing multifunctional materials and smart devices.

         <title>Physicochemical Targeting of Lipid Nanoparticles to the Lungs Induces Clotting: Mechanisms and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that lung&#8208;tropic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing either a cationic or a positive zeta potential conferring ionizable lipid, induce massive thrombosis. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen and activating platelets. Specific anticoagulation techniques and tuning of LNP physical properties are shown to ameliorate thrombosis while preserving lung tropism.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become the dominant drug delivery technology in industry, holding the promise to deliver RNA to up or down&#8208;regulate any protein of interest. LNPs have mostly been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting in which LNP&#8217;s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. Here lung&#8208;tropic LNPs are examined, whose organ tropism derives from containing either a cationic or ionizable lipid conferring a positive zeta potential. Surprisingly, these LNPs are found to induce massive thrombosis. Such thrombosis is shown in the lungs and other organs, and it is shown that it is greatly exacerbated by pre&#8208;existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non&#8208;LNP nanoparticles, and even by lung&#8208;tropic ionizable lipids that do not have a permanent cationic charge. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen, which then activates platelets and thrombin. Based on these mechanisms, multiple solutions are engineered that enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while ameliorating thrombosis. The findings illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re&#8208;engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.

         <title>High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Synergistic Side&#8208;Chain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z19, designed by synergistic side&#8208;chain engineering, affords binary organic solar cells (OSCs) with an impressive PCE of 19.2% at a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), 1.002&#160;V. This is the best performance ever reported for OSCs, VOC&#160;&gt;&#160;1.0&#160;V. Indications are that such design of organic semiconductors, considering the energy&#8208;gap law, may offer the next efficiency breakthrough in OSCs.








Abstract
Restricted by the energy&#8208;gap law, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit relatively low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) because of large nonradiative energy losses (&#916;Enonrad). Moreover, the trade&#8208;off between VOC and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OSCs is more distinctive; the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs are still &lt;15% with VOCs of &gt;1.0&#160;V. Herein, the electronic properties and aggregation behaviors of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are carefully considered and then a new NFA (Z19) is delicately designed by simultaneously introducing alkoxy and phenyl&#8208;substituted alkyl chains to the conjugated backbone. Z19 exhibits a hypochromatic&#8208;shifted absorption spectrum, high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level and ordered 2D packing mode. The D18:Z19&#8208;based blend film exhibits favorable phase separation with face&#8208;on dominated molecular orientation, facilitating charge transport properties. Consequently, D18:Z19 binary devices afford an exciting PCE of 19.2% with a high VOC of 1.002&#160;V, surpassing Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based devices. The former is the highest PCE reported to date for OSCs with VOCs of &gt;1.0&#160;V. Moreover, the&#160;&#916;Enonrad of Z19&#8208; (0.200&#160;eV) and Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based (0.155&#160;eV) devices are lower than that of Y6&#8208;based (0.239&#160;eV) devices. Indications are that the design of such NFA, considering the energy&#8208;gap law, could promote a new breakthrough in OSCs.

         <title>Reconciling the Cooperative&#8211;Competitive Patterns among Tumor and Immune Cells for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Treatment Using Multimodule Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodule nanocomplex dual targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is devised to reconcile cooperative&#8211;competitive patterns among multiple cells through metabolic&#8208;immune regulation. The reversion of metabolic disequilibrium&#8208;immunosuppression tumor microenvironment is observed in TNBC models after treatment, contributing to the tumor remission.








Abstract
Targeting the competitive&#8211;cooperative relationships among tumor cells and various immune cells can efficiently reverse the immune&#8208;dysfunction microenvironment to boost the immunotherapies for the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer treatment. Hence, a bacterial outer membrane vesicle&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed for specifically targeting malignant cells and immune cells to reconcile the relationships based on metabolic&#8208;immune crosstalk. By uniquely utilizing the property of charge&#8208;reversal polymers to realize function separation, the nanocomplexes could synergistically regulate tumor cells and immune cells. This approach could reshape the immunosuppressive competition&#8211;cooperation pattern into one that is immune&#8208;responsive, showcasing significant potential for inducing tumor remission in TNBC models.

         <title>Cobalt MOF&#8208;Based Porous Carbonaceous Spheres for Multimodal Soft Actuator Exhibiting Intricate Biomimetic Motions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbonaceous sphere derived from cobalt metal&#8211;organic frameworks is suggested to develop multimodal electro&#8208;ionic and magnetoactive soft actuators with expanded bandwidth and strong force actuation. These actuators are then utilized to demonstrate the high&#8208;frequency motion of a balancing bird and a dynamic eagle robot having a magneto&#8208;responsive claw.








Abstract
The advancement of&#160;active electrode&#160;materials&#160;is&#160;essential&#160;to&#160;meet&#160;the demand for multifaceted soft robotic interactions.&#160;In&#160;this&#160;study, a new type of porous carbonaceous sphere (PCS) for a multimodal soft actuator capable of both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic responses is reported. The PCS, derived from the simultaneous oxidative and reductive breakdown of specially designed cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Co&#8208;MOFs) with varying metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios, exhibits a high specific surface area of 529 m2 g&#8722;1 and a saturated magnetization of 142.7 Am2 kg&#8722;1. The size of the PCS can be controlled through the Ostwald ripening mechanism, while the porous structure can be regulated by adjusting the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand mol ratio. Its exceptional compatibility with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate)&#160;enables the creation of uniform electrode, crucial for producing soft actuators that work in both magnetic and electrical fields. Operated at an ultralow voltage of 1&#160;V, the PCS&#8208;based actuator generates a blocking force of 47.5 mN and exhibits significant bending deflection even at an oscillation frequency of 10&#160;Hz. Employing this simultaneous multimodal actuation ensures the dynamic and complex motions of a balancing bird robot and a dynamic eagle robot. This advancement marks a significant step toward the realization of more dynamic and versatile soft robotic systems.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Binary Alloy with Oxide Nanosheath for Highly Efficient and Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RuFe oxide catalyst loaded on carbon felt is synthesized through a rapid Joule heating method for oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media. The catalyst has high activity and stable working time up to 250 h in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer devices, which provides a new idea for the research of anode catalyst for industrial water electrolysis.








Abstract
Traditional noble metal oxide, such as RuO2, is considered a benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its practical application is limited due to sluggish activity and severe electrochemical corrosion. In this study, Ru&#8208;Fe nanoparticles loading on carbon felt (RuFe@CF) is synthesized via an ultrafast Joule heating method as an active and durable OER catalyst in acidic conditions. Remarkably low overpotentials of 188 and 269&#160;mV are achieved at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, with a robust stability up to 620 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When used as an anode in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst shows more than 250 h of stability at a water&#8208;splitting current of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental characterizations reveal the presence of a Ru&#8208;based oxide nanosheath on the surface of the catalyst during OER tests, suggesting a surface reconstruction process that enhances the intrinsic activity and inhibits continuous metal dissolution. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of Fe into the RuFe@CF catalyst reduces the energy barrier and boosts its activities. This work offers an effective and universal strategy for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts for acidic water splitting.

         <title>Construction of Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 Tandem Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst Induced Aldehyde Oxidation and the Co&#8208;Activation of Reactants for Biomass Effective and Multi&#8208;Selective Upgrading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 tandem heterogeneous electrocatalyst, which exhibits excellent 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation activity is constructed. The analytical results indicate that the tandem material can promote aldehyde oxidation in the low potential region, enhance the enrichment and transformation of reactants in the high potential region, and then efficiently obtain 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furanoic acid and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid in the tunable potential ranges.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a feasible way for utilization of biomass resources. However, how to regulate the selective synthesis of multiple value&#8208;added products is still a great challenge. The cobalt&#8208;based compound is a promising catalyst due to its direct and indirect oxidation properties, but its weak adsorption capacity restricts its further development. Herein, by constructing Ag&#9472;Co(OH)2 heterogeneous catalyst, the efficient and selective synthesis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furanoic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at different potential ranges are realized. Based on various physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is proved that the addition of Ag can effectively promote the oxidation of aldehyde group to a carboxyl group, and then generate HMFCA at low potential. Moreover, the introduction of Ag can activate cobalt&#8208;based compounds, thus strengthening the adsorption of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promoting the formation of FDCA. This work achieves the selective synthesis of two value&#8208;added chemicals by one tandem catalyst and deeply analyzes the adsorption enhancement mechanism of the catalyst, which provides a powerful guidance for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Mechanical and Functional Responses in Astrocytes under Alternating Deformation Modes Using Magneto&#8208;Active Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Astrocytes respond to mechanical actuation changing their structure, mechanical properties, and functional activity. A magneto&#8208;mechanical system simulates traumatic brain injury and stroke&#8208;induced substrate deformations in vitro. These time&#8208;evolving deformations lead to intertwined remodeling of actin cytoskeleton modulating the mechanical properties of the cell and activating Piezo1. These coordinated changes may influence the protective role of astrocytes for neighboring neurons.








Abstract
This work introduces NeoMag, a system designed to enhance cell mechanics assays in substrate deformation studies. NeoMag uses multidomain magneto&#8208;active materials to mechanically actuate the substrate, transmitting reversible mechanical cues to cells. The system boasts full flexibility in alternating loading substrate deformation modes, seamlessly adapting to both upright and inverted microscopes. The multidomain substrates facilitate mechanobiology assays on 2D and 3D cultures. The integration of the system with nanoindenters allows for precise evaluation of cellular mechanical properties under varying substrate deformation modes. The system is used to study the impact of substrate deformation on astrocytes, simulating mechanical conditions akin to traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke. The results reveal local heterogeneous changes in astrocyte stiffness, influenced by the orientation of subcellular regions relative to substrate strain. These stiffness variations, exceeding 50% in stiffening and softening, and local deformations significantly alter calcium dynamics. Furthermore, sustained deformations induce actin network reorganization and activate Piezo1 channels, leading to an initial increase followed by a long&#8208;term inhibition of calcium events. Conversely, fast and dynamic deformations transiently activate Piezo1 channels and disrupt the actin network, causing long&#8208;term cell softening. These findings unveil mechanical and functional alterations in astrocytes during substrate deformation, illustrating the multiple opportunities this technology&#160;offers.

         <title>Interface Reactive Sputtering of Transparent Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Monolithic and Stacked Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, interface reactive sputtering of transparent electrode is reported for fabricating high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and tandem solar cells (TSCs). Finally, high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 19.17%, 26.89%, and 24.33% are achieved for a semitransparent PSC, a four&#8208;terminal TSC, and a two&#8208;terminal TSC, respectively.








Abstract
Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) fulfills the requirements of top transparent electrodes (TTEs) in semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and stacked tandem solar cells (TSCs), as well as of the recombination layers in monolithic TSCs. However, the high&#8208;energy ITO particles will cause damage to the devices. Herein, the interface reactive sputtering strategy is proposed to construct cost&#8208;effective TTEs with high transmittance and excellent carrier transporting ability. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is chosen as the interface reactant that can react with sputtered ITO nanoparticles,&#160;so that, coordination compounds can be formed during the deposition process, facilitating the carrier transport at the interface of C60/PEI/ITO. Besides, the impact force of energetic ITO particles is greatly alleviated, and the intactness of the underlying C60 layer and perovskite layer is guaranteed. Thus, the prepared semitransparent subcells achieve a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.17%, surpassing those based on C60/ITO (11.64%). Moreover, the PEI&#8208;based devices demonstrate excellent storage stability, which maintains 98% of their original PCEs after 2000 h. On the strength of the interface reactive sputtering ITO electrode, a stacked all&#8208;perovskite TSC with a PCE of 26.89% and a monolithic perovskite&#8211;organic TSC with a PCE of 24.33% are successfully fabricated.

         <title>Engineering Spin&#8208;Orbit Interactions in Silicon Qubits at the Atomic&#8208;Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different Dresselhaus and Rashba spin&#8208;orbit strengths from 0 &#8722; 1113 &#215; 10&#8722;13 eV cm for spin qubits can be engineered by placing phosphorus atoms in different lattice locations in the silicon crystal. The charge noise induced spin relaxation can therefore be minimized when there is no effective spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The results are verified by experimental measurements, atomistic simulations, and symmetry analysis.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit interactions arise whenever the bulk inversion symmetry and/or structural inversion symmetry of a crystal is broken providing a bridge between a qubit's spin and orbital degree of freedom. While strong interactions can facilitate fast qubit operations by all&#8208;electrical control, they also provide a mechanism to couple charge noise thereby limiting qubit lifetimes. Previously believed to be negligible in bulk silicon, recent silicon nano&#8208;electronic devices have shown larger than bulk spin&#8208;orbit coupling strengths from Dresselhaus and Rashba couplings. Here, it is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms in silicon along the [110] direction (without inversion symmetry) or [111] direction (with inversion symmetry), a wide range of Dresselhaus and Rashba coupling strength can be achieved from zero to 1113 &#215; 10&#8722;13eV&#8208;cm. It is shown that with precision placement of phosphorus atoms, the local symmetry (C2v, D2d, and D3d) can be changed to engineer spin&#8208;orbit interactions. Since spin&#8208;orbit interactions affect both qubit operation and lifetimes, understanding their impact is essential for quantum processor&#160;design.

         <title>High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric (HfO2)/2D Semiconductor (HfSe2) Gate Stack for Low&#8208;Power Steep&#8208;Switching Computing Devices</title>

A high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 on 2D HfSe2) is proposed for future low&#8208;power computing applications. The proposed gate stack exhibits atomically sharp interface with suppressed gate leakage ensuring ideal operation (subthreshold slope (SS) &#8776; 60 mV dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, steep&#8208;switching operation (SS &#8776; 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1) overcoming the fundamental Boltzmann limit is demonstrated at room temperature with gated&#8208;region&#8208;controlled structure.








Abstract
Herein, a high&#8208;quality gate stack (native HfO2 formed on 2D HfSe2) fabricated via plasma oxidation is reported, realizing an atomically sharp interface with a suppressed interface trap density (Dit &#8776; 5 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2 eV&#8722;1). The chemically converted HfO2 exhibits dielectric constant, &#954; &#8776; 23, resulting in low gate leakage current (&#8776;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2) at equivalent oxide thickness &#8776;0.5 nm. Density functional calculations indicate that the atomistic mechanism for achieving a high&#8208;quality interface is the possibility of O atoms replacing the Se atoms of the interfacial HfSe2 layer without a substitution energy barrier, allowing layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer oxidation to proceed. The field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor&#8208;fabricated HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack demonstrates an almost ideal subthreshold slope (SS) of &#8776;61 mV dec&#8722;1 (over four orders of IDS) at room temperature (300 K), along with a high Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;108 and a small hysteresis of &#8776;10 mV. Furthermore, by utilizing a device architecture with separately controlled HfO2/HfSe2 gate stack and channel structures, an impact ionization field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated that exhibits n&#8208;type steep&#8208;switching characteristics with a SS value of 3.43 mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature, overcoming the Boltzmann limit. These results provide a significant step toward the realization of post&#8208;Si semiconducting devices for future energy&#8208;efficient data&#8208;centric computing electronics.

         <title>Machine Learning to Promote Efficient Screening of Low&#8208;Contact Electrode for 2D Semiconductor Transistor Under Limited Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and feature&#8208;adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low&#8208;contact electrodes for 2D semiconductor transistors in a limited data scenario is proposed. This scheme outperforms classical models and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art boosting techniques trained using limited datasets, as well as models trained using randomly selected data.








Abstract
Low&#8208;barrier and high&#8208;injection electrodes are crucial for high&#8208;performance (HP) 2D semiconductor devices. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies for electrode material screening are impractical because of their low efficiency and arbitrary specificity. Although machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative to tackle this problem, its practical application in semiconductor devices is hindered by its substantial data requirements. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and a feature&#8208;adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low&#8208;contact electrode materials for 2D semiconductor transistors with limited data is proposed. The proposed scheme exhibits exceptional performance by training with only 15% of the total data points, where the mean square errors are 0.17 and 0.27&#160;eV for the vertical and lateral Schottky barrier, respectively, and 2.88% for tunneling probability. Further, it exhibits an optimal predictive performance for 100 randomly sampled training datasets, reveals the underlying physical insight based on the identified features, and realizes continual improvement by employing detailed density&#8208;of&#8208;states descriptors. Finally, the empirical evaluations of the transport characteristics are conducted and verified by constructing MOSFET devices. These findings demonstrate the considerable potential of machine&#8208;learning techniques for screening high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials and constructing HP 2D semiconductor devices.

         <title>Backside Coating for Stable Zn Anode with High Utilization Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn electrode with unique backside coating is facilely constructed for stable anode with high Zn utilization. The backside coating significantly reduces stress concentration, accelerates heat diffusion, and facilitates electron transfer, thus effectively preventing dendrite growth and achieving long&#8208;term Zn&#8208;ion battery with high specific and volumetric energy density.








Abstract
Stable Zn anodes with high utilization rate are urgently required to promote the specific and volumetric energy densities of Zn&#8208;ion batteries for practical applications. Herein, contrary to the widely utilized surface coating on Zn anodes, this work shows that a zinc foil with a backside coated layer delivers much enhanced cycling stability even under high depth of discharge. The backside coating significantly reduces stress concentration, accelerates heat diffusion, and facilitates electron transfer, thus effectively preventing dendrite growth and structural damage at high Zn utilization. As a result, the developed anode can be stably cycled for 334&#160;h at 85.5%&#160;Zn utilization, which outperforms bare Zn and previously reported results on surface&#8208;coated Zn foils. An NVO&#8208;based full cell also shows stable performance with high Zn utilization rate&#160;(69.4%), low negative&#8208;positive electrodes ratio (1.44), and high specific/volumetric energy densities (155.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1/178&#160;Wh L&#8722;1), which accelerates the progress toward practical zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with a size of 3.5&#160;nm, composed of FeCoNiCuMn are successfully synthesized, and they are immobilized on TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimal 0.5&#8208;HEA/TiO2 sample demonstrates a remarkable 23&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to pristine TiO2, with excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation and high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation.








Abstract
Metal nanoparticle (NP) cocatalysts are widely investigated for their ability to enhance the performance of photocatalytic materials; however, their practical application is often limited by the inherent instability under light irradiation. This challenge has catalyzed interest in exploring high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), which, with their increased entropy and lower Gibbs free energy, provide superior stability. In this study, 3.5&#160;nm&#8208;sized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NPs composed of a FeCoNiCuMn HEA are successfully synthesized. With theoretic calculation and experiments, the electronic structure of HEA in augmenting the catalytic CO2 reduction has been uncovered, including the individual roles of each element and the collective synergistic effects. Then, their photocatalytic CO2 reduction capabilities are investigated when immobilized on TiO2. HEA NPs significantly enhance the CO2 photoreduction, achieving a 23&#8208;fold increase over pristine TiO2, with CO and CH4 production rates of 235.2 and 19.9&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Meanwhile, HEA NPs show excellent stability under simulated solar irradiation, as well high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation. This research emphasizes the promising role of HEA NPs, composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements, in revolutionizing the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Antigen Presenting Cell Mimetic Lipid Nanoparticles for Rapid mRNA CAR T Cell Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) combine the antigen presenting cell&#8208;mimetic character of commonly used T cell activating beads with the mRNA transfecting capabilities of LNPs. aLNPs facilitate rapid, one&#8208;step activation and transfection of primary human T cells with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) mRNA without requiring activating beads, potentially reducing the complexity, cost, and time of mRNA CAR T cell production.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, producing these bespoke cancer&#8208;killing cells is a complicated ex vivo process involving leukapheresis, artificial T cell activation, and CAR construct introduction. The activation step requires the engagement of CD3/TCR and CD28 and is vital for T cell transfection and differentiation. Though antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) facilitate activation in vivo, ex vivo activation relies on antibodies against CD3 and CD28 conjugated to magnetic beads. While effective, this artificial activation adds to the complexity of CAR T cell production as the beads must be removed prior to clinical implementation. To overcome this challenge, this work develops activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) that mimic APCs to combine the activation of magnetic beads and the transfection capabilities of LNPs. It is shown that aLNPs enable one&#8208;step activation and transfection of primary human T cells with the resulting mRNA CAR T cells reducing tumor burden in a murine xenograft model, validating aLNPs as a promising platform for the rapid production of mRNA CAR T cells.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular and Photocrosslinked Interpenetrating Network Hydrogel Matrices for 3D&#8208;Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[8]uril mediated interpenetrating network (IPN) supramolecular hydrogels with tunable chemical and physical crosslink densities are prepared for applications as dynamic biomaterial inks. By mixing functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with CB[8], two physical networks are formed. The application of an external light source rapidly and selectively transforms one physical network into a covalent network. The obtained gels show cytocompatibility, printability, and post&#8208;extrusion stability.








Abstract
Printing of biologically functional constructs is significant for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Designing bioinks remains remarkably challenging due to the multifaceted requirements in terms of the physical, chemical, and biochemical properties of the three&#8208;dimensional matrix, such as cytocompatibility, printability, and shape fidelity. In order to promote matrix and materials stiffness, while not sacrificing stress relaxation mechanisms which support cell spreading, migration, and differentiation, this work reports an interpenetrating network (IPN) bioink design. The approach makes use of a chemically defined network, combining physical and chemical crosslinking units with a tunable composition and network density, as well as spatiotemporal control over post&#8208;assembly material stiffening. To this end, star&#8208;shaped poly(ethylene glycol)s functionalized with Phe&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide or photoactive stilbazolium are synthesized, and used to prepare three&#8208;dimensional networks with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) through supramolecular host&#8211;guest complexation. The hydrogel obtained shows fast relaxation and thus supports the proliferation and differentiation of cells. Upon irradiation, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel can be rapidly adapted via selective photochemical dimerization of stilbazolium within CB[8], leading to IPNs with increased form stability while retaining the dynamic nature of the hydrogels. This modular approach opens new design opportunities for extrudable and cell&#8208;friendly dynamic biomaterials for applications in 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

Abstract
Choreographing the adaptive shapes of patterned surfaces to exhibit designable mechanical interactions with their environment remains an intricate challenge. Here, a novel category of strain&#8208;engineered dynamic&#8208;shape materials, empowering diverse multi&#8208;dimensional shape modulations that are combined to form fine&#8208;grained adaptive microarchitectures is introduced. Using micro&#8208;origami tessellation technology, heterogeneous materials are provided with strategic creases featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive micro&#8208;hinges that morph precisely upon chemical and electrical cues. Freestanding multifaceted foldable packages, auxetic mesosurfaces, and morphable cages are three of the forms demonstrated herein of these complex 4&#8208;dimensional (4D) metamaterials. These systems are integrated in dual proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept bioelectronic demonstrations: a soft foldable supercapacitor enhancing its power density (&#8776;108&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a bio&#8208;adaptive device with a dynamic shape that may enable novel smart&#8208;implant technologies. This work demonstrates that intelligent material systems are now ready to support ultra&#8208;flexible 4D microelectronics, which can impart autonomy to devices culminating in the tangible realization of microelectronic morphogenesis.

         <title>Hierarchical Piezoelectric Composites for Noninvasive Continuous Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a hierarchical composite with impressive piezoelectric performances for noninvasive continuous blood pressure monitoring and hemodynamic parameter collection with accuracy comparable to clinical results. It is expected to empower both patients and clinicians with referable hemodynamic information, thus facilitating early diagnosis and effective management of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and multiparametric analysis of cardiac functions are crucial for the early diagnosis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. However, existing monitoring approaches often suffer from bulky and intrusive apparatus, cumbersome testing procedures, and challenging data processing, hampering their applications in continuous monitoring. Here, a heterogeneously hierarchical piezoelectric composite is introduced for wearable continuous BP and cardiac function monitoring, overcoming the rigidity of ceramic and the insensitivity of polymer. By optimizing the hierarchical structure and components of the composite, the developed piezoelectric sensor delivers impressive performances, ensuring continuous and accurate monitoring of BP at Grade A level. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters are extracted from the detected signals, such as local pulse wave velocity, cardiac output, and stroke volume, all of which are in alignment with clinical results. Finally, the all&#8208;day tracking of cardiac function parameters validates the reliability and stability of the developed sensor, highlighting its potential for personalized healthcare systems, particularly in early diagnosis and timely intervention of cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Enabling Logistics Automation in Nanofactory: Cobalt Phosphide Embedded Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic nanofactory is constructed by embedding CoP nanocrystals within Zn&#8208;ZIF for ammonia production via nitride reduction reaction. Mimicking the modern factory with manufacturing machines and logistics automation, the designed CoP/Zn&#8208;ZIFs nanofactory reinforces the overall nitride reduction process from feedstock supply, reactant conversion, and product desorption, achieving excellent Faraday efficiency and production rate of ammonia.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a promising strategy for green ammonia synthesis and wastewater treatment, the rational design of electrocatalysts is the cornerstone. Inspired by modern factory design where both machines and logistics matter for manufacturing, it is reported that cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in zinc&#8208;based zeolite imidazole frameworks (Zn&#8208;ZIF) function as a nanofactory with high performance. By selective phosphorization of ZnCo bimetallic zeolite imidazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;ZIF), the generated CoP nanoparticles act as &#8220;machines&#8221; (active sites) for molecular manufacturing (NO3&#8722; to NH4+ conversion). The purposely retained framework (Zn&#8208;ZIFs) with positive charge promotes logistics automation, i.e., the automatic delivery of NO3&#8722; reactants and timely discharge of NH4+ products in&#8208;and&#8208;out the nanofactory due to electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the interaction between Zn&#8208;ZIF and CoP modulates the Co sites into electron insufficient state with upshifted d&#8208;band center, facilitating the reduction/hydrogenation of NO3&#8722; to ammonia and restricting the competitive hydrogen evolution. Consequently, the assembled CoP/Zn&#8208;ZIF nanofactory exhibits superior NitRR performances with a high Faraday efficiency of &#8776;97% and a high ammonia yield of 0.89&#160;mmol cm&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in neutral condition, among the best of reported electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;An electrocatalytic nanofactory is constructed by embedding CoP nanocrystals within Zn-ZIF for ammonia production via nitride reduction reaction. Mimicking the modern factory with manufacturing machines and logistics automation, the designed CoP/Zn-ZIFs nanofactory reinforces the overall nitride reduction process from feedstock supply, reactant conversion, and product desorption, achieving excellent Faraday efficiency and production rate of ammonia.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a promising strategy for green ammonia synthesis and wastewater treatment, the rational design of electrocatalysts is the cornerstone. Inspired by modern factory design where both machines and logistics matter for manufacturing, it is reported that cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in zinc-based zeolite imidazole frameworks (Zn-ZIF) function as a nanofactory with high performance. By selective phosphorization of ZnCo bimetallic zeolite imidazole framework (ZnCo-ZIF), the generated CoP nanoparticles act as &#8220;machines&#8221; (active sites) for molecular manufacturing (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion). The purposely retained framework (Zn-ZIFs) with positive charge promotes logistics automation, i.e., the automatic delivery of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reactants and timely discharge of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; products in-and-out the nanofactory due to electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the interaction between Zn-ZIF and CoP modulates the Co sites into electron insufficient state with upshifted &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center, facilitating the reduction/hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to ammonia and restricting the competitive hydrogen evolution. Consequently, the assembled CoP/Zn-ZIF nanofactory exhibits superior NitRR performances with a high Faraday efficiency of &#8776;97% and a high ammonia yield of 0.89&#160;mmol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral condition, among the best of reported electrocatalysts. The work provides new insights into the design principles of efficient NitRR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Living Polymer Networks with Adaptive Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores carbazole&#8208;based thiuram disulfides (CTDs) as dynamic linkages in light&#8208;induced living (LIL) polymer networks, showcasing their dual reactivity for reshuffling and initiating polymerization under blue light irradiation. CTDs rapidly respond to visible light, enabling shape manipulation, healing, and chain extension in optically opaque polymer networks. This strategy offers new possibilities for LIL polymer networks with adaptive functional properties.








Abstract
The advent of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) through the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds has led to unprecedented properties of macromolecular systems, which can be engineered at the molecular level. Among the various types of stimuli that can be used to trigger chemical changes within polymer networks, light stands out for its remote and spatiotemporal control under ambient conditions. However, most examples of photoactive CANs need to be transparent and they exhibit slow response, side reactions, and limited light penetration. In this vein, it is interesting to&#160;understand how molecular engineering of optically active dynamic linkages that offer fast response to visible light can impart &#8220;living&#8221; characteristics to CANs, especially in opaque systems. Here, the use of carbazole&#8208;based thiuram disulfides (CTDs) that offer dual reactivity as photoactivated reshuffling linkages and iniferters under visible light irradiation is reported. The fast response to visible light activation of the CTDs leads to temporal control of shape manipulation, healing, and chain extension in the polymer networks, despite the lack of optical transparency. This strategy charts a promising avenue for manipulating multifunctional photoactivated CANs in a controlled manner.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Flexible Carbon Nanofilms with Synergistically Enhanced Transmittance and Conductivity Prepared by Reorganizing Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel facet&#8208;driven carbon nanotube network reorganization method is developed to prepare large&#8208;area flexible freestanding transparent and conductive carbon nanofilms with synergistic enhancement of multiple properties, such as mechanical strength, transmittance and conductivity, and the area up to A3 size and even meter&#8208;length. Based on the film, a new smart window is fabricated.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs) are highly desired for future electronic devices. Nanocarbon TCFs are one of the most promising candidates, but some of their properties are mutually restricted. Here, a novel carbon nanotube network reorganization (CNNR) strategy, that is, the facet&#8208;driven CNNR (FD&#8208;CNNR) technique, is presented to overcome this intractable contradiction. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique introduces an interaction between single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and Cu&#9472;&#8208;O. Based on the unique FD&#8208;CNNR mechanism, large&#8208;area flexible reorganized carbon nanofilms (RNC&#8208;TCFs) are designed and fabricated with A3&#8208;size and even meter&#8208;length, including reorganized SWNT (RSWNT) films and graphene and RSWNT (G&#8208;RSWNT) hybrid films. Synergistic improvement in strength, transmittance, and conductivity of flexible RNC&#8208;TCFs is achieved. The G&#8208;RSWNT TCF shows sheet resistance as low as 69&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1 at 86% transmittance, FOM value of 35, and Young's modulus of &#8776;45&#160;MPa. The high strength enables RNC&#8208;TCFs to be freestanding on water and easily transferred to any target substrate without contamination. A4&#8208;size flexible smart window is fabricated, which manifests controllable dimming and fog removal. The FD&#8208;CNNR technique can be extended to large&#8208;area or even large&#8208;scale fabrication of TCFs and can provide new insights into the design of TCFs and other functional films.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Engineering of Cubic SiP with Metallic Conductivity for Fast and Durable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

High entropy silicon&#8208;phosphides are synthesized, demonstrating significantly improved charge and mass transport rates, and superior anti&#8208;pulverization capability, compared with the parent phases.








Abstract
A cost&#8208;effective, scalable ball milling process is employed to synthesize the InGeSiP3 compound with a cubic ZnS structure, aiming to address the sluggish reaction kinetics of Si&#8208;based anodes for Lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Experimental measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirm that the synthesized InGeSiP3 exhibits significantly higher electronic conductivity, larger Li&#8208;ion diffusivity, and greater tolerance to volume change than its parent phases InGe (or Si)P2 or In (or Ge, or Si)P. These improvements stem from its elevated configurational entropy. Multiple characterizations validate that InGeSiP3 undergoes a reversible Li&#8208;storage mechanism that involves intercalation, followed by conversion and alloy reactions, resulting in a reversible capacity of 1733&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 90%. Moreover, the InGeSiP3&#8208;based electrodes exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining an 1121&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 capacity with a retention rate of &#8776;87% after 1500 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and remarkable high&#8208;rate capability, achieving 882&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of high entropy, the synthesis is extended to high entropy GaCu (or Zn)InGeSiP5, CuZnInGeSiP5, GaCuZnInGeSiP6, InGeSiP2S (or Se), and InGeSiPSSe. This endeavor overcomes the immiscibility of different metals and non&#8208;metals, paving the way for the electrochemical energy storage application of high&#8208;entropy silicon&#8208;phosphides.

         <title>Decoding Excimer Formation in Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks Induced by Morphology and Ring Torsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of extended organic semiconductors routinely used for photocatalysis. However, excited&#8208;state charge dynamics in these materials is still a black box. This work establishes the effect of physical parameters, e.g., morphology and topography of COFs on their photophysical&#160;and&#160;photocatalytic properties originating from different transient intermediates.








Abstract
A thorough and quantitative understanding of the fate of excitons in covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) after photoexcitation is essential for their augmented optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications via precise structure tuning. The synthesis of a library of COFs having identical chemical backbone with impeded conjugation, but varied morphology and surface topography to study the effect of these physical properties on the photophysics of the materials is herein reported. The variation of crystallite size and surface topography substantified different aggregation pattern in the COFs, which leads to disparities in their photoexcitation and relaxation properties. Depending on aggregation, an inverse correlation between bulk luminescence decay time and exciton binding energy of the materials is perceived. Further transient absorption spectroscopic analysis confirms the presence of highly localized, immobile, Frenkel excitons (of diameter 0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;nm) via an absence of annihilation at high density, most likely induced by structural torsion of the COF skeletons, which in turn preferentially relaxes via long&#8208;lived (nanosecond to microsecond) excimer formation (in femtosecond scale) over direct emission.

     alt="Decoding Excimer Formation in Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks Induced by Morphology and Ring Torsion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of extended organic semiconductors routinely used for photocatalysis. However, excited-state charge dynamics in these materials is still a black box. This work establishes the effect of physical parameters, e.g., morphology and topography of COFs on their photophysical&#160;and&#160;photocatalytic properties originating from different transient intermediates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thorough and quantitative understanding of the fate of excitons in covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) after photoexcitation is essential for their augmented optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications via precise structure tuning. The synthesis of a library of COFs having identical chemical backbone with impeded conjugation, but varied morphology and surface topography to study the effect of these physical properties on the photophysics of the materials is herein reported. The variation of crystallite size and surface topography substantified different aggregation pattern in the COFs, which leads to disparities in their photoexcitation and relaxation properties. Depending on aggregation, an inverse correlation between bulk luminescence decay time and exciton binding energy of the materials is perceived. Further transient absorption spectroscopic analysis confirms the presence of highly localized, immobile, Frenkel excitons (of diameter 0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;nm) via an absence of annihilation at high density, most likely induced by structural torsion of the COF skeletons, which in turn preferentially relaxes via long-lived (nanosecond to microsecond) excimer formation (in femtosecond scale) over direct emission. These insights underpin the importance of structural and topological design of COFs for their targeted use in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A&#8208;D&#8208;A Molecule&#8211;Bridge Interface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface bridging strategy (IBS) is proposed to mitigate energy loss and enhance stability at the perovskite/C60 interface by designing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives. This IBS effectively passivates surface defects, enhances interfacial coupling, and optimizes the film&#8208;forming process of the C60 layer, leading to the successful development of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar submodules with an efficiency of 18.7%.








Abstract
As the photovoltaic field endeavors to transition perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to industrial applications, inverted PSCs, which incorporate fullerene as electron transport layers, have emerged as a compelling choice due to their augmented stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, these attributes suffer from performance issues stemming from suboptimal electrical characteristics at the perovskite/fullerene interface. To surmount these hurdles, an interface bridging strategy (IBS) is proposed to attenuate the interface energy loss and enhance the interfacial stability by designing a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A type perylene monoimide (PMI) derivatives with multifaceted advantages. In addition to passivating defects, the IBS plays a crucial role in facilitating the binding between perovskite and fullerene, thereby enhancing interface coupling and importantly, improving the formation of fullerene films. The PMI derivatives, functioning as bridges, serve as a protective barrier to enhance the device stability. Consequently, the IBS enables a remarkable efficiency of 24.62% for lab&#8208;scale PSCs and an efficiency of 18.73% for perovskite solar modules craft on 156&#160;&#215;&#160;156&#160;mm2 substrates. The obtained efficiencies represent some of the highest recorded for fullerene&#8208;based devices, showcasing significant progress in designing interfacial molecules at the perovskite/fullerene interface and offering a promising path to enhance the commercial viability of PSCs.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Phase&#8208;Engineered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels for Enhanced Ethylamine Electrosynthesis from Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, it is found that the high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs), due to the introduction of multiple elements, increase the chaos of the system, allowing them to maintain the stability of face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) structure at higher annealing temperatures without further phase transitions, which enhances their catalytic performance, demonstrating the important role of crystal&#8208;phase regulation for HEAAs.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering that promotes the rearrangement of active atoms to form new structural frameworks achieves excellent result in the field of electrocatalysis and optimizes the performance of various electrochemical reactions. Herein, for the first time, it is found that the different components in metallic aerogels will affect the crystal&#8208;phase transformation, especially in high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs), whose crystal&#8208;phase transformation during annealing is more difficult than medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs), but they still show better electrochemical performance. Specifically, PdPtCuCoNi HEAAs with the parent phase of face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) PdCu possess excellent 89.24% of selectivity, 746.82&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. of yield rate, and 90.75% of Faraday efficiency for ethylamine during acetonitrile reduction reaction (ARR); while, maintaining stability under 50&#160;h of long&#8208;term testing and ten consecutive electrolysis cycles. The structure&#8211;activity relationship indicates that crystal&#8208;phase regulation from amorphous state to FCC phase promotes the atomic rearrangement in HEAAs, thereby optimizing the electronic structure and enhancing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, improving the catalytic performance. This study provides a new paradigm for developing novel ARR electrocatalysts and also expands the potential of crystal&#8208;phase engineering in other application areas.

         <title>Optimizing Ultrathin 2D Transistors for Monolithic 3D Integration: A Study on Directly Grown Nanocrystalline Interconnects and Buried Contacts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin, high&#8208;performance transistor layer suitable for multilayer stacking is developed for monolithic 3D integration, utilizing directly grown nanocrystalline graphene and dry&#8208;transferred MoS2 film. This device structure retains the advantages of a dangling bond&#8208;free, ultrathin channel and low contact resistivity, making it a significant enabler for high&#8208;density 3D circuit technology.








Abstract
The potential of monolithic 3D integration technology is largely dependent on the enhancement of interconnect characteristics which can lead to thinner stacks, better heat dissipation, and reduced signal delays. Carbon materials such as graphene, characterized by sp2 hybridized carbons, are promising candidates for future interconnects due to their exceptional electrical, thermal conductivity and resistance to electromigration. However, a significant challenge lies in achieving low contact resistance between extremely thin semiconductor channels and graphitic materials. To address this issue, an innovative wafer&#8208;scale synthesis approach is proposed that enables low contact resistance between dry&#8208;transferred 2D semiconductors and the as&#8208;grown nanocrystalline graphitic interconnects. A hybrid graphitic interconnect with metal doping reduces the sheet resistance by 84% compared to an equivalent thickness metal film. Furthermore, the introduction of a buried graphitic contact results in a contact resistance that is 17 times lower than that of bulk metal contacts (&gt;40&#160;nm). Transistors with this optimal structure are used to successfully demonstrate a simple logic function. The thickness of active layer is maintained within sub&#8208;7&#160;nm range, encompassing both channels and contacts. The ultrathin transistor and interconnect stack developed here, characterized by a readily etchable interlayer and low parasitic resistance, leads to heterogeneous integration of future 3D integrated circuits (ICs).

         <title>Design of Mixed&#8208;Matrix MOF Membranes with Asymmetric Filler Density and Intrinsic MOF/Polymer Compatibility for Enhanced Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multizoning strategy creates mixed&#8208;matrix membranes with asymmetric&#8208;filler density, which maximizes filler utilization and enhances solvent flux. The selection of compatible MOF&#8211;polymer pairs improves the interfacial adhesion without the need for further functionalization steps, which simplifies the fabrication process while facilitating the formation of selective molecular transport pathways.








Abstract
The separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals from organic solvents is important for many industries. Membrane&#8208;based nanofiltration offers a more energy&#8208;efficient separation than the conventional thermal processes. Conceivably, mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs), encompassing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as fillers, are poised to promote selective separation via molecular sieving, synergistically combining polymers flexibility and fine&#8208;tuned porosity of MOFs. Nevertheless, conventional direct mixing of MOFs with polymer solutions results in underutilization of the MOF fillers owing to their uniform cross&#8208;sectional distribution. Therefore, in this work, a multizoning technique is proposed to produce MMMs with an asymmetric&#8208;filler density, in which the MOF fillers are distributed only on the surface of the membrane, and a seamless interface at the nanoscale. The design strategy demonstrates five times higher MOF surface coverage, which results in a solvent permeance five times higher than that of conventional MMMs while maintaining high selectivity. Practically, MOFs are paired with polymers of similar chemical nature to enhance their adhesion without the need for surface modification. The approach offers permanently accessible MOF porosity, which translates to effective molecular sieving, as exemplified by the polybenzimidazole and Zr&#8211;BI&#8211;fcu&#8208;MOF system. The findings pave the way for the development of composite materials with a seamless interface.

         <title>Ready&#8208;to&#8208;Use Free&#8208;Standing Super&#8208;Powder Made with Complex Nanoparticles for SERS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an efficient method for producing a high&#8208;yield, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, free&#8208;standing super&#8208;powder, adaptable to various nanoparticle shapes and compositions. Utilizing Au nanorings with their distinctive aspect ratio, allows for the formation of packed columnar assemblies, aligning the exposed inter&#8208;particles gaps perpendicular to the laser beam, thereby improving surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection under both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;contamination conditions.








Abstract
This study presents a straightforward and efficient synthetic approach for producing high&#8208;yield, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, free&#8208;standing super&#8208;powder. The synthesis protocol demonstrates versatility, enabling the creation of assemblies from various nanoparticle morphologies and compositions without the need for specific substrates. Au nanorings are employed as building blocks for fabricating the super&#8208;powder, which can be used in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The distinctive aspect ratio of the ring nanoframes allows the formation of densely packed columnar assemblies on the substrate, aligning the exposed gaps perpendicular to the laser beam. This arrangement significantly enhances the charge separation among nanorings, leading to a highly focused near&#8208;field that is applicable to SERS analysis. The SERS detection feasibility of this powder in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;contamination conditions is demonstrated. Using a wide range of building blocks, encompassing various shapes (for instance, rods, hexagons, cubes, cuboctahedrons, elongated dodecahedrons, triangular rings, double&#8208;rings, elongated dodecahedra frames, cuboctahedra frames, and double&#8208;walled frames), the generalizability of the process for synthesizing super&#8208;powders with diverse morphologies is substantiated.

Abstract
A type of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer composites is reported and showcased that their 3D nanolattices exhibit a superior combination of high strength, toughness, deformability, resilience, and damage&#8208;tolerance. Notably, the strength and toughness of ultralight copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices in some cases surpass current best performers, including alumina, nickel, and other ceramic or metallic lattices at low densities. Additionally, copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices are super&#8208;resilient, crack&#8208;resistant, and one&#8208;step printed under ambient condition which can be easily integrated into sophisticated microsystems as highly effective internal protectors. The findings suggest that, unlike traditional nanocomposites, the laser&#8208;induced interface and the high fraction of ultrasmall Cu15 nanoclusters as crosslinking junctions contribute to the marked nonlinear elasticity of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer network, which synergizes with the lattice&#8208;topology effect and culminates in the exceptional mechanical performance.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Rectified Gradient Porous Polymeric Film for Solar&#8208;Thermal Regulatory Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible and thermally rectified gradient porous polymeric film is synthesized using a concentration&#8208;gradient polymerization approach. This gradient porous polymeric film possesses both thermal rectification and spectral&#8208;selective properties, making it a promising candidate as a solar&#8208;thermal regulatory cooling material that is capable of mitigating parasitic heat and solar radiation from outdoors while on&#8208;demand dissipating excess heat from indoors.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal regulation concerning thermal insulation and solar modulation is pivotal for cooling textiles and smart buildings.&#160;Nevertheless, a contradiction arises in balancing the demand to prevent external heat infiltration with the efficient dissipation of excess heat from enclosed spaces. Here, a concentration&#8208;gradient polymerization strategy is presented for fabricating a gradient porous polymeric film comprising interconnected polymeric microspheres. This method involves establishing an electric field&#8208;driven gradient distribution of charged crosslinkers in the precursor solution, followed by subsequent polymerization and freeze&#8208;drying processes. The resulting porous film exhibits a significant porosity gradient along its thickness, leading to exceptional unidirectional thermal insulation capabilities with a thermal rectification factor of 21%. The gradient porous film, with its thermal rectification properties, effectively reconciles the conflicting demands of diverse thermal conductivity for cooling unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces. Consequently, the gradient porous film demonstrates remarkable enhancements in solar&#8208;thermal management, achieving temperature reductions of 3.0 and 4.1&#160;&#176;C for unheated and spontaneously heated enclosed spaces, respectively, compared to uniform porous films. The developed gradient&#8208;structured porous film thus holds promise for the development of thermal&#8208;rectified materials tailored to regulate solar&#8208;thermal conditions within enclosed environments.

         <title>Deeply Lithiated Carbonaceous Materials for Great Lithium Metal Protection in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

A Li&#8208;rich disordered rock salt shell is revealed as a multifunctional decorator to tailor carbonaceous materials with great ability to protect Li metal electrode in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Protection of lithium (Li) metal electrode is a core challenge for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Carbon materials with variant structures have shown great effect of Li protection in liquid electrolytes, however, can accelerate the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) decomposition owing to the high electronic conductivity, seriously limiting their application in ASSLMBs. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to tailor the carbon materials for efficient Li protection in ASSLMBs, by in situ forming a rational niobium&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich disordered rock salt (DRS) shell on the carbon materials, providing a favorable percolating Li+ diffusion network for speeding the carbon lithiation, and enabling simultaneously improved lithiophilicity and reduced electronic conductivity of the carbon structure at deep lithiation state. Using the proposed strategy, different carbon materials, such as graphitic carbon paper and carbon nanotubes, are tailored with great ability to speed the interfacial kinetics, homogenize the Li plating/stripping processes, and suppress the SE decompositions, enabling much improved performances of ASSLMBs under various conditions approaching the practical application. This strategy is expected to create a novel roadmap of Li protection for developing reliable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLMBs.

         <title>Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure Monitoring with Mechanically&#8208;Compliant Hydrogel Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure with Hydrogel Interfaces: Wireless pressure sensors are anchored onto the biological tissues/organs with a mechanically&#8208;compliant and robust hydrogel interface, which could effectively alleviate foreign body responses and mitigate the interfacial mechanical mismatch, and enhance the efficacy of the wireless pressure sensing.








Abstract
Recent electronics&#8208;tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long&#8208;term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically&#8208;varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, a general yet reliable approach is reported to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability, and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period. The operation of the wireless sensor has been demonstrated with a custom&#8208;made pressure sensing model and in vivo intracranial pressure monitoring in rats. This technology may be advantageous in real&#8208;time post&#8208;operative monitoring of various biological inner pressures after the reconstructive surgery, thus guaranteeing the timely treatment of lethal&#160;diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure with Hydrogel Interfaces: Wireless pressure sensors are anchored onto the biological tissues/organs with a mechanically-compliant and robust hydrogel interface, which could effectively alleviate foreign body responses and mitigate the interfacial mechanical mismatch, and enhance the efficacy of the wireless pressure sensing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent electronics-tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long-term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically-varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, a general yet reliable approach is reported to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability, and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period. The operation of the wireless sensor has been demonstrated with a custom-made pressure sensing model and in vivo intracranial pressure monitoring in rats. This technology may be advantageous in real-time post-operative monitoring of various biological inner pressures after the reconstructive surgery, thus guaranteeing the timely treatment of lethal&#160;diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyroelectric&#8208;Accelerated Perovskite Photodetector for Picosecond Light Detection and Ranging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast pyroelectricity&#8208;assisted perovskite photodetector exhibits a transient responsivity and detectivity of 0.65 A W&#8722;1 and 4.10 &#215; 1012 Jones under 638 nm light. The pyroelectric electrons enable quick direct recombination to the excess holes in the bulk, achieving a remarkable response time of 176 ps.2








Abstract
Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is indispensable in applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous driving, and biomimetic robots. However, the precision and available distance of LiDAR are constrained by the speed and sensitivity of the photodetector, necessitating the use of expensive and energy&#8208;consuming avalanche diodes. To address these challenges, in this study, a pyroelectricity&#8208;based acceleration strategy with 2D&#8208;(graded 3D) perovskite heterojunction is proposed to achieve a record high speed (27.7 ns with an active area of 9 mm2, and 176 ps with an active area of 0.2 mm2) and high responsivity (0.65 A W&#8722;1) at zero bias. This success is attributed to the unique mechanism where the electrons from the pyroelectric effect at the Cl&#8208;rich 2D/3D interface directly recombine with excess holes during light&#8211;dark transitions, breaking speed limitations related to carrier mobility and capacitive effect. Furthermore, the introduced pyroelectric effect significantly enhances the photoresponse, resulting in a self&#8208;powered external quantum efficiency exceeding 100%. The study also demonstrates precise position detection at the centimeter level. In conclusion, this research presents a pioneering approach for developing high&#8208;speed photodiodes with exceptional sensitivity, mitigating energy and cost concerns in LiDAR applications.

         <title>Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Modules for Efficient and Reliable Low&#8208;Grade Heat Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>

A thermoelectric module with a balanced conversion efficiency of 6.9% and output power density of 0.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2 (&#916;T = 200 K) is obtained based on the zone&#8208;melted Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 with CuGaTe2 addition. CuGaTe2 not only strengthens the interlayer interaction, but also introduces various defects. Finally, a peak ZT of 1.25 and an average ZT of 1.02 (300&#8211;500 K) are&#160;achieved.








Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;telluride&#8208;based alloy has long been considered as the most promising candidate for low&#8208;grade waste heat power generation. However, optimizing the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 is more challenging than that of p&#8208;type counterparts due to its greater sensitivity to texture, and thus limits the advancement of thermoelectric modules. Herein, the thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;type Bi2Te3 is enhanced by incorporating a small amount of CuGaTe2, resulting in a peak ZT of 1.25 and a distinguished average ZT of 1.02 (300&#8211;500 K). The decomposed Cu+ strengthens interlayer interaction, while Ga+ optimizes carrier concentration within an appropriate range. Simultaneously, the emerged numerous defects, such as small&#8208;angle grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and dislocations, significantly suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity. Based on the size optimization by finite element modelling, the constructed thermoelectric module yields a high conversion efficiency of 6.9% and output power density of 0.31&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under a temperature gradient of 200 K. Even more crucially, the efficiency and output power little loss after subjecting the module to 40 thermal cycles lasting for 6 days. This study demonstrates the efficient and reliable Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric modules for broad applications in low&#8208;grade heat harvest.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids Combined with 3D Hybridization Chain Reaction Amplifiers for Monitoring Multiple Human Tear Cytokines</title>

         <dc:description>
The authors leverage DNA tetrahedral frameworks modified on the wireless portable electrodes to effectively capture 3D hybridization chain reaction amplifiers for automatic and sensitive monitoring of multiple dry eye syndrome&#8208;associated cytokines in human tears with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg mL&#8722;1, consuming as little as 3 mL of tear fluid. 









Abstract
Existing tear sensors are difficult to perform multiplexed assays due to the minute amounts of biomolecules in tears and the tiny volume of tears. Herein, the authors leverage DNA tetrahedral frameworks (DTFs) modified on the wireless portable electrodes to effectively capture 3D hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplifiers for automatic and sensitive monitoring of multiple cytokines in human tears. The developed sensors allow the sensitive determination of various dry eye syndrome (DES)&#8208;associated cytokines in human tears with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg&#160;mL&#8722;1, consuming as little as 3 mL of tear fluid. Double&#8208;blind testing of clinical DES samples using the developed sensor and commercial ELISA shows no significant difference between them. Compared with single&#8208;biomarker diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of this sensor based on multiple biomarkers has improved by &#8776;16%. The developed system offers the potential for tear sensors to enable personalized and accurate diagnosis of various ocular diseases.

         <title>Dynamic (Sub)surface&#8208;Oxygen Enables Highly Efficient Carbonyl&#8208;Coupling for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent Cu species significantly affect the product profile of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR)CO2 but their dynamic evolutions and roles are not well evaluated. An alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface&#8208;oxygenated degree (&#954;) to quantify the active high&#8208;valent Cu species, is proposed in this work, which is the critical factor to regulate the multi&#8208;carbon production of CO2RR.








Abstract
Nowadays, high&#8208;valent Cu species (i.e., Cu&#948;+) are clarified to enhance multi&#8208;carbon production in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nonetheless, the inconsistent average Cu valence states are reported to significantly govern the product profile of CO2RR, which may lead to misunderstanding of the enhanced mechanism for multi&#8208;carbon production and results in ambiguous roles of high&#8208;valent Cu species. Dynamic Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR leads to erratic valence states and challenges of high&#8208;valent species determination. Herein, an alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface&#8208;oxygenated degree (&#954;), is proposed to quantify the active high&#8208;valent Cu species on the (sub)surface, which regulates the multi&#8208;carbon production of CO2RR. The &#954; validates a strong correlation to the carbonyl (*CO) coupling efficiency and is the critical factor for the multi&#8208;carbon enhancement, in which an optimized Cu2O@Pd2.31 achieves the multi&#8208;carbon partial current density of &#8776;330 mA cm&#8722;2 with a faradaic efficiency of 83.5%. This work shows a promising way to unveil the role of high&#8208;valent species and further achieve carbon neutralization.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR leads to erratic valence states and challenges of high-valent species determination. Herein, an alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface-oxygenated degree (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;), is proposed to quantify the active high-valent Cu species on the (sub)surface, which regulates the multi-carbon production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The &#954; validates a strong correlation to the carbonyl (*CO) coupling efficiency and is the critical factor for the multi-carbon enhancement, in which an optimized Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O@Pd&lt;sub&gt;2.31&lt;/sub&gt; achieves the multi-carbon partial current density of &#8776;330 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a faradaic efficiency of 83.5%. This work shows a promising way to unveil the role of high-valent species and further achieve carbon neutralization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Microscale wireless rectifiers built on single chiral tellurium (Te) break current limitations in powering &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices. Unlike traditional Schottky diodes, these rectifiers operate in the radiofrequency range at ultra&#8208;low powers by exploiting Te non&#8208;linear conductivity. They also offer unprecedented rectification tuneability by electrostatic gating. This breakthrough promises micrometer&#8208;scale, single&#8208;material wireless rectifiers, revolutionizing IoT power solutions.









Abstract
Wireless radiofrequency rectifiers have the potential to power the billions of &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices currently in use by effectively harnessing ambient electromagnetic radiation. However, the current technology relies on the implementation of rectifiers based on Schottky diodes, which exhibit limited capabilities for high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;power applications. Consequently, they require an antenna to capture the incoming signal and amplify the input power, thereby limiting the possibility of miniaturizing devices to the millimeter scale. Here, the authors report wireless rectification at the GHz range in a microscale device built on single chiral tellurium with extremely low input powers. By studying the crystal symmetry and the temperature dependence of the rectification, the authors demonstrate that its origin is the intrinsic nonlinear conductivity of the material. Additionally, the unprecedented ability to modulate the rectification output by an electrostatic gate is shown. These results open the path to developing tuneable microscale wireless rectifiers with a single material.

         <title>An Electrode&#8208;Crosstalk&#8208;Suppressing Smart Polymer Electrolyte for High Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal&#8208;induced crosstalk between electrodes, especially gas crosstalk, is a key issue in triggering uncontrollable thermal runaway. This work demonstrates the greatness and feasibility of smart polymer electrolyte with abundant function&#8208;motifs in prolonging the cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries at normal operating condition; while, simultaneously suppressing electrode crosstalk under abused conditions.








Abstract
Electrode crosstalk between anode and cathode at elevated temperatures is identified as a real culprit triggering the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, to address this challenge, a novel smart polymer electrolyte is prepared through in situ polymerization of methyl methacrylate and acrylic anhydride monomers within a succinonitrile&#8208;based dual&#8208;anion deep eutectic solvent. Owing to the abundant active unsaturated double bonds on the as&#8208;obtained polymer matrix end, this smart polymer electrolyte can spontaneously form a dense crosslinked polymer network under elevated temperatures, effectively slowing down the crosstalk diffusion kinetics of lithium ions and active gases. Impressively, LiCoO2/graphite pouch cells employing this smart polymer electrolyte demonstrate no thermal runaway even at the temperature up to 250&#160;&#176;C via accelerating rate calorimeter testing. Meanwhile, because of its abundance of functional motifs, this smart polymer electrolyte can facilitate the formation of stable and thermally robust electrode/electrolyte interface on both electrodes, ensuring the long cycle life and high safety of LIBs. In specific, this smart polymer electrolyte endows 1.1&#160;Ah&#160;LiCoO2/graphite pouch cell with a capacity retention of 96% after 398 cycles at 0.2 C.

The sustainable device cycle by utilizing water to reconstitute flexible electronic devices using perovskite and conductor materials is developed. Large&#8208;scale metal&#8208;free flexible X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated by one&#8208;click restart show an average&#160;sensitivity as high as 6204 &#181;C Gyair&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2, making them very effective for X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, finding a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable method for handling end&#8208;of&#8208;life devices has remained challenging. Here, a &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; eco&#8208;friendly recycling strategy is introduced for end&#8208;of&#8208;life perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This method, utilizing water, allows for the recapture and reuse of both perovskite and conductor materials. The process is straightforward and environmentally friendly, eliminating the need for further chemical treatment, purification, additional additives or catalysts, and complex equipment. A sustainable device cycle is developed by reconstructing flexible perovskite membranes for wearable electronics from recycled materials. Large&#8208;scale, flexible membranes made from metal&#8208;free perovskite DABCO&#8208;N2H5&#8208;I3 (DABCO = N&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) achieve remarkably impressive average sensitivity of 6204 &#177; 268 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 102.3 nGyair s&#8722;1, which makes highly effective for X&#8208;ray imaging. The sensitivity of recycled flexible devices not only matches that of single&#8208;crystal devices made with fresh materials but also ranks as the highest among all metal&#8208;free perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. &#8220;One&#8208;Click Restart&#8221; applies to scalable flexible devices derived from aged single&#8208;crystal counterparts, offering significant cost, time, and energy savings compared to their single&#8208;crystal equivalents. Such advantages significantly boost future market competitiveness.

         <title>Topological Electronic Transition Contributing to Improved Thermoelectric Performance in p&#8208;Type Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix Solid Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is proposed and discovered for the first time that Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix solid solutions are the canonical material system that utilizes the adjustment of solid solution composition in order for inducing topological electronic transition. This results in a multivalley valence band and a narrow bandgap at compositions with x &gt; 1.0, leading to much improved thermoelectric performance of p&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix.








Abstract
Topological electronic transition is the very promising strategy for achieving high band degeneracy (NV) and for optimizing thermoelectric performance. Herein, this work verifies in p&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix that topological electronic transition could be the key mechanism responsible for elevating the NV of valence band edge from 1 to 6, leading to much improved thermoelectric performance. Through comprehensive spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations of electronic structures, the topological electronic transition from trivial semiconductor is unambiguously demonstrated to topological semimetal of Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix with increasing the Bi content, due to the strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling of Bi and the band inversion. The distinct evolution of Fermi surface configuration and the multivalley valence band edge with NV of 6 are discovered in the Bi&#8208;rich compositions, while a peculiar two&#8208;step band inversion is revealed for the first time in the end compound Mg3Bi2. As a result, the optimal p&#8208;type Mg3Sb0.5Bi1.5 simultaneously obtains a positive bandgap and high NV of 6, and thus acquires the largest thermoelectric power factor of 3.54 and 6.93 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 300 and 575 K, respectively, outperforming the values in other compositions. This work provides important guidance on improving thermoelectric performance of p&#8208;type Mg3Sb2&#8722;xBix utilizing the topological electronic transition.

&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) and for optimizing thermoelectric performance. Herein, this work verifies in p-type Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bi&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; that topological electronic transition could be the key mechanism responsible for elevating the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; of valence band edge from 1 to 6, leading to much improved thermoelectric performance. Through comprehensive spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations of electronic structures, the topological electronic transition from trivial semiconductor is unambiguously demonstrated to topological semimetal of Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bi&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; with increasing the Bi content, due to the strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling of Bi and the band inversion. The distinct evolution of Fermi surface configuration and the multivalley valence band edge with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; of 6 are discovered in the Bi-rich compositions, while a peculiar two-step band inversion is revealed for the first time in the end compound Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the optimal p-type Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously obtains a positive bandgap and high &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; of 6, and thus acquires the largest thermoelectric power factor of 3.54 and 6.93 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 and 575 K, respectively, outperforming the values in other compositions. This work provides important guidance on improving thermoelectric performance of p-type Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bi&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; utilizing the topological electronic transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extraordinary Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Interaction in NbOBr2 Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and anisotropic second&#8208; and third&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG and THG) processes are observed in a novel 2D material, niobium oxide dibromide (NbOBr2). Both SHG and THG processes in NbOBr2 are significantly enhanced up to hundreds of times by coupling with a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (F&#8208;P) microcavity. The enhancement factor is anisotropic and reaches maximum along the crystal b&#8211;axis.








Abstract
2D materials are burgeoning as promising candidates for investigating nonlinear optical effects due to high nonlinear susceptibilities, broadband optical response, and tunable nonlinearity. However, most 2D materials suffer from poor nonlinear conversion efficiencies, resulting from reduced light&#8208;matter interactions and lack of phase matching at atomic thicknesses. Herein, a new 2D nonlinear material, niobium oxide dibromide (NbOBr2) is reported, featuring strong and anisotropic optical nonlinearities with scalable nonlinear intensity. Furthermore, Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (F&#8208;P) microcavities are constructed by coupling NbOBr2 with air holes in silicon. Remarkable enhancement factors of &#8776;630 times in second harmonic generation (SHG) and 210 times in third harmonic generation (THG) are achieved on cavity at the resonance wavelength of 1500&#160;nm. Notably, the cavity enhancement effect exhibits strong anisotropic feature tunable with pump wavelength, owing to the robust optical birefringence of NbOBr2. The ratio of the enhancement factor along the b&#8211; and c&#8211;axis of NbOBr2 reaches 2.43 and 5.27 for SHG and THG at 1500&#160;nm pump, respectively, which leads to an extraordinarily high SHG anisotropic ratio of 17.82 and a 10&#176; rotation of THG polarization. The research presents a feasible and practical strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;power&#8208;pumped on&#8208;chip nonlinear optical devices with tunable anisotropy.

         <title>Monodispersed and Organic Amine Modified La(OH)3 Nanocrystals for Superior Advanced Phosphate Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodispersed and organic amine modified lanthanum hydroxide (OA&#8208;La(OH)3) nanocrystals are synthesized via a nonaqueous wet&#8208;chemical method. The OA&#8208;La(OH)3 nanocrystals further expose La adsorption sites and minimize mass transfer barrier by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), thereby dramatically increasing its phosphate adsorption capacity, pH adaptability, and anti&#8208;interference performance.








Abstract
Advanced phosphate removal is critical for alleviating the serious and widespread aquatic eutrophication, strongly depending on the development of superior adsorption materials to overcome low chemical affinity and sluggish mass transfer at low phosphate concentrations. Herein, the first synthesis of monodispersed and organic amine modified&#160;lanthanum hydroxide nanocrystals (OA&#8208;La(OH)3) for advanced phosphate removal by modulating inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), is reported. These OA&#8208;La(OH)3 nanocrystals with positively charged surfaces and abundant exposed La sites exhibit&#160;specific affinity toward phosphate, delivering a maximum adsorption capacity of 168&#160;mg P&#160;g&#8315;1 and a wide pH adaptability from 3.0 to 11.0, as well as a robust anti&#8208;interference performance, far surpassing those of documented phosphate removal materials. The superior phosphate removal performance of OA&#8208;La(OH)3 is attributed to its protonated organic amine in IHP, which enhances the electrostatic attraction around the adsorbent&#8208;solution interface. Impressively, OA&#8208;La(OH)3 can treat &#8776;5 000 and &#8776;3 200 bed volumes of simulated and real phosphate&#8208;containing wastewater to below extremely strict standard (0.1&#160;mg&#160;L&#8315;1) in a fixed&#8208;bed adsorption mode, exhibiting great potential for advanced phosphate removal. This study offers a facile modification strategy to improve phosphate removal performance of nanoscale adsorbents, and sheds light on the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship of La&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Constructing Bipolar Dual&#8208;Active Sites through High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Induced Electric Dipole Transition for Decoupling Oxygen Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy FeCoNiMnCrO exhibits a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Coth sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on Nioh sites compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides, which is resulted from the low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites generated by the severe lattice distortion.








Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct active sites to break the trade&#8208;off between oxidation and reduction processes occurring in battery cathodes with conversion mechanism, especially for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) involved in the zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Here, using a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;driven electric dipole transition strategy to activate and stabilize the tetrahedral sites is proposed, while enhancing the activity of octahedral sites through orbital hybridization in a FeCoNiMnCrO spinel oxide, thus constructing bipolar dual&#8208;active sites with high&#8208;low valence states, which can effectively decouple ORR/OER. The FeCoNiMnCrO high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with severe lattice distortion, exhibits a strong 1s&#8594;4s electric dipole transition and intense t2g(Co)/eg(Ni)&#8208;2p(OL) orbital hybridization that regulates the electronic descriptors, eg and t2g, which leads to the formation of low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites (Coth) and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites (Nioh), resulting in a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Coth sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on Nioh sites as well as a superior performance of ZABs compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides. Therefore, entropy engineering presents a distinctive approach for designing catalytic sites by inducing novel electromagnetic properties in materials across various electrocatalytic reactions, particularly for decoupling systems.

The introduction of an asymmetric atomic electric field at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network inherent in the electrolyte and thus manipulate the structure of H2O molecules and the dissociation process. Continuous replenishment of free H2O molecules and smaller H2O dissociation energy barrier ensures FeNiRu/C's exceptional hydrogen evolution activity (166.2 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 187.1 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2 in seawater) at industrial current density.








Abstract
Manipulating the structural and kinetic dissociation processes of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface is vital for alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at industrial current density. This is seldom actualized due to the intricacies of the electrochemical reaction interface. Herein, this work introduces a rapid, nonequilibrium cooling technique for synthesizing ternary Turing catalysts with short&#8208;range ordered structures (denoted as FeNiRu/C). These advanced structures empower the FeNiRu/C to exhibit excellent HER performance in 1 m KOH with an ultralow overpotential of 6.5 and 166.2 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and a specific activity 7.3 times higher than that of Pt/C. Comprehensive mechanistic analyses reveal that abundant atomic species form asymmetric atomic electric fields on the catalyst surface inducing a directed evolution and the dissociation process of interfacial H2O molecules. In addition, the locally topologized structure effectively mitigates the high hydrogen coverage of the active site induced by the high current density. The establishment of the relationship between free water population and HER activity provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high performance alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>Programmable DNA Interphase Layers for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high energy and power densities, as well as long cycle number have been achieved by an ultrathin and programmable DNA interphase layer. It represents an efficient yet long&#8208;neglected candidate for anode&#8208;free batteries, which not only breaks through the limitations in thickness and performance, but also provides a new paradigm to unlock next&#8208;generation energy storage.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising candidates for advanced energy storage, attributed to their appealing characteristics such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, their major challenges lie in the poor cycling and rate performance owing to the inferior reversibility and kinetics of Li plating and stripping, which significantly hinder their real&#8208;world applications. Here, it is demonstrated that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the most important genetic material in nature, can serve as a highly programmable interphase layer for innovation of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries. It is found that the abundant base pairs in DNA can contribute transient Li&#8211;N bonds that facilitate homogeneous Li+ flux, thus resulting in excellent Li plating/stripping kinetics and reversibility even at a harsh areal current of 15 mA cm&#8722;2. The anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries based on an ultrathin (0.12 &#181;m) and ultralight (&#8776;0.01 mg cm&#8722;2) DNA interphase layer show high CEs (&#8776;99.1%) over 400 cycles, corresponding to an increase of &#8776;186% compared with bare copper (Cu) foil. These results shed light on the excellent programmability of DNA as a new family of interphase materials for anode&#8208;free batteries, and provide a new paradigm for future battery innovation toward high programmability, high sustainability, and remarkable electrochemical performance.

         <title>Releasing Free Radicals in Precursor Triggers the Formation of Closed Pores in Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sufficient free radicals formed by part delignification are helpful to direct the formation of closed pores, while excessive free radicals formed by nearly total delignificaion compete for limited precursor debris to form smaller microcrystals and therefore reduce the amounts of closed pores.








Abstract
Increasing closed pore volume in hard carbon is considered to be the most effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of systematic insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level. In this study, a regulation strategy of closed pores via adjustment of the content of free radicals is reported. Sufficient free radicals are exposed by part delignification of bamboo, which is related to the formation of well&#8208;developed carbon layers and rich closed pores. In addition, excessive free radicals from nearly total delignification lead to more reactive sites during pyrolysis, which competes for limited precursor debris to form smaller microcrystals and therefore compact the material. The optimal sample delivers a large closed pore volume of 0.203 cm3 g&#8722;1, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 350 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 mA g&#8722;1 and enhanced Na+ transfer kinetics. This work provides insights into the formation mechanisms of closed pores at molecular level, enabling rational design of hard carbon pore structures.

         <title>Narrow Bandgap Schottky Heterojunction Sonosensitizer with High Electron&#8211;Hole Separation Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG Schottky heterojunction sonosensitizer boosted the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) leads to mitochondrial depolarization and DNA damage under US irradiation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic bladder tumor models, TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG demonstrates a notable inhibitory effect on the proliferation of bladder tumors and a significant enhancement of sonodynamic therapy efficacy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is applied to bladder cancer (BC) given its advantages of high depth of tissue penetration and nontoxicity due to the unique anatomical location of the bladder near the abdominal surface. However, low electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency and wide bandgap of sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of SDT. This study aims to develop a TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG Schottky heterojunction sonosensitizer with high electron&#8211;hole separation and narrow bandgap for SDT in BC. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments collectively demonstrate that the bandgap of TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG is reduced due to the Schottky heterojunction with the characteristic of crystalline&#8208;amorphous interface formed by the deposition of ruthenium (Ru) within the shell layer of TiO2. Thanks to the enhancement of oxygen adsorption and the efficient separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) irradiation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. The in vivo results prove that TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG boosted the subcutaneous and orthotopic bladder tumor models while exhibiting good safety. This study adopts the ruthenium complex for optimizing sonosensitizers, contributing to the progress of SDT improvement strategies and presenting a paradigm for BC therapy.

         <title>Super&#8208;Stretchable and High&#8208;Energy Micro&#8208;Pseudocapacitors Based on MXene Embedded Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly stretchable Zn&#8208;ion hybrid micro&#8208;pseudocapacitor (ZIH&#8208;MPC) based on in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles on MXene nanosheets (Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene) as flexible film cathode is designed and constructed, which exhibits a stable voltage and energy output even under 100% elongation state. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy to realize high energy density in stretchable hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The advancement of aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors offers an enticing prospect for a broad spectrum of applications, spanning from wearable electronics to micro&#8208;robotics and sensors. Unfortunately, conventional micro&#8208;supercapacitors are characterized by low capacity and slopy voltage profiles, limiting their energy density capabilities. To enhance the performance of these devices, the use of 2D MXene&#8208;based compounds has recently been proposed. Apart from their capacitive contributions, these structures can be loaded with redox&#8208;active nanowires which increase their energy density and stabilize their operation voltage. However, introducing rigid nanowires into MXene films typically leads to a significant decline in their mechanical properties, particularly in terms of flexibility. To overcome this issue, super stretchable micro&#8208;pseudocapacitor electrodes composed of MXene nanosheets and in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles (Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene) are herein demonstrated, delivering high energy density, stable operation voltage of &#8776;1 V, and fast charging capabilities. Careful experimental analysis and theoretical simulations of the charging mechanism of the Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene electrodes reveal a dual nature charge storage mechanism involving ad(de)sorption of ions and conversion reaction of Ag nanoparticles. The superior mechanical properties of synthesized films obtained through in situ construction of Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene structure show an ultra stretchability, allowing the devices to provide stable voltage and energy output even at 100% elongation.

&lt;p&gt;A novel highly stretchable Zn-ion hybrid micro-pseudocapacitor (ZIH-MPC) based on in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles on MXene nanosheets (Ag-NP-MXene) as flexible film cathode is designed and constructed, which exhibits a stable voltage and energy output even under 100% elongation state. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy to realize high energy density in stretchable hybrid supercapacitors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advancement of aqueous micro-supercapacitors offers an enticing prospect for a broad spectrum of applications, spanning from wearable electronics to micro-robotics and sensors. Unfortunately, conventional micro-supercapacitors are characterized by low capacity and slopy voltage profiles, limiting their energy density capabilities. To enhance the performance of these devices, the use of 2D MXene-based compounds has recently been proposed. Apart from their capacitive contributions, these structures can be loaded with redox-active nanowires which increase their energy density and stabilize their operation voltage. However, introducing rigid nanowires into MXene films typically leads to a significant decline in their mechanical properties, particularly in terms of flexibility. To overcome this issue, super stretchable micro-pseudocapacitor electrodes composed of MXene nanosheets and in situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NP-MXene) are herein demonstrated, delivering high energy density, stable operation voltage of &#8776;1 V, and fast charging capabilities. Careful experimental analysis and theoretical simulations of the charging mechanism of the Ag-NP-MXene electrodes reveal a dual nature charge storage mechanism involving ad(de)sorption of ions and conversion reaction of Ag nanoparticles. The superior mechanical properties of synthesized films obtained through in situ construction of Ag-NP-MXene structure show an ultra stretchability, allowing the devices to provide stable voltage and energy output even at 100% elongation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicolor Photochemical Printing Inside Polymer Matrices for Advanced Photonic Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional security inks printed on the data page surface are vulnerable to counterfeiters and can be chemically deciphered. To address this issue, high&#8208;quality multicolored fluorescent patterns inside the polymer matrices for the first time are photochemically printed. Moreover, these patterns are chemically indecipherable, offering a superior way to fight against document fraud.








Abstract
Conventional security inks, generally directly printed on the data page surface, are vulnerable to counterfeiters, thereby raising the risk of chemical structural deciphering. In fact, polymer film&#8208;based data pages with customized patterns embedded within polymer matrix, rather than printed on the surface, emerge as a promising solution. Therefore, the key lies in developing fluorophores offering light dose&#8208;controlled fluorescent color inside polymer matrices. Though conventional fluorophores often suffer from photobleaching and uncontrolled photoreactions, disqualifying them for this purpose. Herein a diphenanthridinylfumaronitrile&#8208;based phototransformers (trans&#8208;D5) that undergoes photoisomerization and subsequent photocyclization during photopolymerization of the precursor, successively producing cis&#8208; and cyclo&#8208;D5 with stepwise redshifted solid&#8208;state emissions is developed. The resulting cyclo&#8208;D5 exhibits up to 172 nm emission redshift in rigidifying polymer matrices, while trans&#8208;D5 experiences a slightly blueshifted emission (&#8776;28 nm), cis&#8208;D5 undergoes a modest redshift (&#8776;14 nm). The markedly different rigidochromic behaviors of three D5 molecules within polymer matrices enable multicolor photochemical printing with a broad hue ranging from 38 to 10 via an anticlockwise direction in Munsell color space, yielding indecipherable fluorescent patterns in polymer films. This work provides a new method for document protection and implements advanced security features that are unattainable with conventional inks.

         <title>Microstrain&#8208;Stimulated Elastico&#8208;Mechanoluminescence with Dual&#8208;Mode Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient green&#8208;emitting elastio&#8208;mechanoluminescence with dual&#8208;mode stress sensing characteristics driven by microscale strain is developed in the LiTaO3:Tb3+, demonstrating the outstanding sensing capability for the amplitude and velocity of applied stress. Impressively, the fabricated thin film is capable of generating discernible mechanoluminescence signals even at low strain (500 &#181;st), indicating the significant prospect in advanced microstrain sensing area.








Abstract
Elastico&#8208;mechanoluminescence technology has shown significant application prospects in stress sensing, artificial skin, remote interaction, and other research areas. Its progress mainly lies in realizing stress visualization and 2D or even 3D stress&#8208;sensing effects using a passive sensing mode. However, the widespread promotion of mechanoluminescence (ML) technology is hindered by issues such as high stress or strain thresholds and a single sensing mode based on luminous intensity. In this study, a highly efficient green&#8208;emitting ML with dual&#8208;mode stress&#8208;sensing characteristics driven by microscale strain is developed using LiTaO3:Tb3+. In addition to single&#8208;mode sensing based on the luminous intensity, the self&#8208;defined parameter (Q) is also introduced as a dual&#8208;mode factor for sensing the stress velocity. Impressively, the fabricated LiTaO3:Tb3+ film is capable of generating discernible ML signals even when supplied with strains as low as 500 &#181;st. This is the current minimum strain value that can drive green&#8208;emitting ML. This study offers an ideal photonic platform for exploring the potential applications of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped elastico&#8208;ML materials in remote interaction devices, high&#8208;precision stress sensors, and single&#8208;molecule biological imaging.

         <title>Record&#8208;Efficiency Printable Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by the Multifunctional Schiff Base Derivative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record power conversion efficiency of 19.74% is achieved for the printable hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based mesoscopic perovskite solar cell by introducing the multifunctional additive of (chloromethylene) dimethyliminium chloride (CDCl). As a Stiff base derivative, CDCl interacts well with TiO2 and perovskite, which induces modulated energy level alignment and enhanced crystallinity of perovskite in mesopores for the enhanced device performance.








Abstract
Tailoring multifunctional additives for performing interfacial modifications, improving crystallization, and passivating defects is instrumental for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a Schiff base derivative, (chloromethylene) dimethyliminium chloride (CDCl), is introduced as an additive to modify the interface between the mesoporous TiO2 electron transport layer and the MAPbI3 light absorber during the annealing process. CDCl chemically links to TiO2 and MAPbI3 through coordination and hydrogen bonding, respectively, and results in the construction of fast electron extraction channels. CDCl also optimizes the energy&#8208;level alignment of the TiO2/MAPbI3 heterojunction and improves the pore&#8208;filling and crystallization of MAPbI3 in the mesoscopic scaffold, which inhibits nonradiative recombination and eliminates open&#8208;circuit voltage losses. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.74%, which is the best one ever reported, is obtained for printable carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free PSCs based on MAPbI3.

         <title>A T&#8208;Cell Inspired Sonoporation System Enhances Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Radioimmunotherapy Efficacy by Restoring Gasdermin&#8208;E Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated perforation, the biomimetic sonoporation system (UPS) can open target cell membranes and deliver genes under ultrasound control, facilitating gasdermin&#8208;E re&#8208;expression. Through UPS&#8208;assisted genome&#8208;editing, low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray induces pyroptosis in tumors and triggers potent antitumor immune functions.








Abstract
Genome editing has the potential to improve the unsatisfactory therapeutic effect of antitumor immunotherapy. However, the cell plasma membrane prevents the entry of almost all free genome&#8208;manipulation agents. Therefore, a system can be spatiotemporally controlled and can instantly open the cellular membrane to allow the entry of genome&#8208;editing agents into target cells is needed. Here, inspired by the ability of T cells to deliver cytotoxins to cancer cells by perforation, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled perforation system (UPS) is established to enhance the delivery of free genome&#8208;manipulating agents. The UPS can perforate the tumor cell membrane while maintaining cell viability via a controllable lipid peroxidation reaction. In vitro, transmembrane&#8208;incapable plasmids can enter cells and perform genome editing with the assistance of UPS, achieving an efficiency of up to 90%. In vivo, the UPS is biodegradable, nonimmunogenic, and tumor&#8208;targeting, enabling the puncturing of tumor cells under US. With the application of UPS&#8208;assisted genome editing, gasdermin&#8208;E expression in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice is successfully restored, which leads to pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy via low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation. This study provides new insights for designing a sonoporation system for genome editing. Moreover, the results demonstrate that restoring gasdermin expression by genome editing significantly improves the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy.

This study provides new insights for designing a sonoporation system for genome editing. Moreover, the results demonstrate that restoring gasdermin expression by genome editing significantly improves the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid&#8208;Electrolytes System Established by Dual Super&#8208;lyophobic Membrane Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid electrolytes strategy enabled by under&#8208;liquid dual super&#8208;lyophobic membrane&#8208;based separator to break the incompatibility of ester/ether&#8208;based electrolytes between high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li anode.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes and related aqueous rechargeable batteries own unique advantage on safety and environmental friendliness, but coupling high energy density Li&#8208;metal batteries with aqueous electrolyte still represent challenging and not yet reported. Here, this work makes a breakthrough in &#8220;high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;metal batteries&#8221; (HVALMBs) by adopting a brilliant hybrid&#8208;electrolytes strategy. Concentrated ternary&#8208;salts ether&#8208;based electrolyte (CTE) acts as the anolyte to ensure the stability and reversibility of Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Eco&#8208;friendly water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WiS) electrolyte acts as catholyte to support the healthy operation of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Most importantly, the aqueous catholyte and non&#8208;aqueous anolyte are isolated in each independent chamber without any crosstalk. Aqueous catholyte permeation toward Li anode can be completely prohibited without proton&#8208;induced corrosion, which is enabled by the introduction of under&#8208;liquid dual super&#8208;lyophobic membrane&#8208;based separator, which can realize the segregation of the most effective immiscible electrolytes with a surface tension difference as small as 6 mJ m&#8722;2. As a result, the aqueous electrolyte can be successfully coupled with Li&#8208;metal anode and achieve the fabrication of HVALMBs (hybrid&#8208;electrolytes system), which presents long&#8208;term cycle stability with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 300 cycles (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 || Li (limited) cell) and high energy density (682&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes with Interfacial Percolation Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial percolation network is proposed for fabricating conductive and stretchable electrodes. The 2D surface and 3D bulk conducting channels are electrically connected by a protruding AgNWs design, resulting in enhanced conductivity under large deformation with high cyclic stability.








Abstract
Stretchable electrodes are an essential component that determines the functionality and reliability of stretchable electronics, but face the challenge of balancing conductivity and stretchability. This work proposes a new conducting concept called the interfacial percolation network (PN) that results in stretchable electrodes with high conductivity, large stretchability, and high stability. The interfacial PN is composed of a 2D silver nanowires (AgNWs) PN and a protruding 3D AgNWs PN embedded on the surface and in the near&#8208;surface region of an elastic polymer matrix, respectively. The protruded PN is obtained by changing the arrangements of AgNWs from horizontal to quasi&#8208;vertical through introducing foreign polymer domains in the near&#8208;surface region of the polymer matrix. The resulting electrode achieves a conductivity of 13&#160;500 S cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of 660%. Its resistance changes under stretched conditions are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional 2D PN and 2D + 3D PN. An interfacial PN electrode made from liquid metal remained its conductivity at&#160;46&#160;750 S cm&#8722;1 after the electrode underwent multiple stretch&#8208;release cycles with a deformation of &gt;600%. The concept of interfacial PN provides fruitful implications for the design of stretchable electronics.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes and Minor Concentration Quenching: Achieving High&#8208;Performance Nondoped and Doped Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type molecular skeleton is designed to realize blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence with ultrahigh emission efficiencies (up to 99%), nanosecond exciton lifetimes, and effectively suppressed concentration quenching in films. The doped and nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes attain high external quantum efficiencies up to 32.0% and 26.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), ultrashort exciton lifetime, and suppressed concentration quenching in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials is desirable yet challenging. Here, a novel acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type TADF emitter, namely, 2BO&#8208;sQA, wherein two oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron (BO) acceptors are arranged with cofacial alignment and positioned nearly orthogonal to the rigid dispirofluorene&#8208;quinolinoacridine (sQA) donor is reported. This molecular design enables the compound to achieve highly efficient (PLQYs up to 99%) and short&#8208;lived (nanosecond&#8208;scale) blue TADF with effectively suppressed concentration quenching in films. Consequently, the doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) base on 2BO&#8208;sQA achieve exceptional electroluminescence performance across a broad range of doping concentrations, maintaining maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) at over 30% for doping concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 wt%. Remarkably, the nondoped blue OLED achieves a record&#8208;high maximum EQE of 26.6% with a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.0% at 1000 candelas per square meter. By using 2BO&#8208;sQA as the sensitizer for the multiresonance TADF emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue emission. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this molecular design in developing TADF emitters with high efficiency, ultrashort exciton lifetime, and minimal concentration quenching.

         <title>High Hydrogen Storage in Trigonal Prismatic Monomer&#8208;Based Highly Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two highly porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), C&#8208;PAF and Si&#8208;PAF, synthesized from trigonal prismatic monomers, exhibit unmatched porosities among the porous organic materials. These materials display record&#8208;breaking gravimetric hydrogen delivery capacities, combined with substantial volumetric delivery capacities, surpassing existing benchmark materials. Additionally, these PAFs demonstrate remarkable structural stability and long&#8208;term durability, attributed to their robust C&#9472;C covalent bonds.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage is crucial in the shift toward a carbon&#8208;neutral society, where hydrogen serves as a pivotal renewable energy source. Utilizing porous materials can provide an efficient hydrogen storage solution, reducing tank pressures to manageable levels and circumventing the energy&#8208;intensive and costly current technological infrastructure. Herein, two highly porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), C&#8208;PAF and Si&#8208;PAF, prepared through a Yamamoto C&#9472;C coupling reaction between trigonal prismatic monomers, are reported. These PAFs exhibit large pore volumes and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller areas, 3.93 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 4857 m2 g&#8722;1 for C&#8208;PAF, and 3.80 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 6099 m2 g&#8722;1 for Si&#8208;PAF, respectively. Si&#8208;PAF exhibits a record&#8208;high gravimetric hydrogen delivery capacity of 17.01 wt% and a superior volumetric capacity of 46.5&#160;g L&#8722;1 under pressure&#8208;temperature swing adsorption conditions (77 K, 100&#160;bar &#8594; 160 K, 5&#160;bar), outperforming benchmark hydrogen storage materials. By virtue of the robust C&#9472;C covalent bond, both PAFs show impressive structural stabilities in harsh environments and unprecedented long&#8208;term durability. Computational modeling methods are employed to simulate and investigate the structural and adsorption properties of the PAFs. These results demonstrate that C&#8208;PAF and Si&#8208;PAF are promising materials for efficient hydrogen storage.

         <title>Strengthening the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancies in Electrocatalysts for Efficient Glycerol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the qualitative tuning of oxygen&#8208;vacancy density on the reaction pathway of glycerol electrooxidation (GOR) is investigated, demonstrating that the synergistic effect induced by neighboring oxygen vacancies effectively promotes the C&#9472;C bond cleavage of C2 intermediates to formate. This work offers insights for designing high&#8208;performance GOR electrocatalysts, facilitating the development of cost&#8208;effective and energy&#8208;saving chemical production technologies.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered bimetallic oxides exhibit high potential for the electrolysis of small organic molecules. However, the ambiguity in the relationship between the defect density and electrocatalytic performance makes it challenging to control the final products of multi&#8208;step multi&#8208;electron reactions in such electrocatalytic systems. In this study, controllable kinetics reduction is used to maximize the oxygen vacancy density of a Cu&#9472;Co oxide nanosheet (CuCo2O4 NS), which is used to catalyze the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GOR). The CuCo2O4&#8722;x NS with the highest oxygen&#8208;vacancy density (CuCo2O4&#8722;x&#8208;2) oxidizes C3 molecules to C1 molecules with selectivity of almost 100% and a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99%, showing the best oxidation performance among all the modified catalysts. Systems with multiple oxygen vacancies in close proximity to each other synergistically facilitate the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds. Density functional theory calculations confirm the ability of closely spaced oxygen vacancies to facilitate charge transfer between the catalyst and several key glycolic&#8208;acid (GCA) intermediates of the GOR process, thereby facilitating the decomposition of C2 intermediates to C1 molecules. This study reveals qualitatively in tuning the density of oxygen vacancies for altering the reaction pathway of GOR by the synergistic effects of spatial proximity of high&#8208;density oxygen vacancies.

         <title>Mitigating the Overheat of Stretchable Electronic Devices Via High&#8208;Enthalpy Thermal Dissipation of Hydrogel Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel modular encapsulation strategy that provides high enthalpy thermal dissipation for mitigating the overheat of stretchable electronics is proposed. The hydrogel&#8208;based&#160;encapsulation can provide thermal protection through water evaporation and automatically recover its functions by absorbing moisture. This method &#160;provides a universal pathway for improving the thermal stability of stretchable electronics in practical applications.








Abstract
The practical application of flexible and stretchable electronics is significantly influenced by their thermal and chemical stability. Elastomer substrates and encapsulation, due to their soft polymer chains and high surface&#8208;area&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, are particularly susceptible to high temperatures and flame. Excessive heat poses a severe threat of damage and decomposition to these elastomers. By leveraging water as a high enthalpy dissipating agent, here, a hydrogel encapsulation strategy is proposed to enhance the flame retardancy and thermal stability of stretchable electronics. The hydrogel&#8208;based encapsulation provides thermal protection against flames for more than 10 s through the evaporation of water. Further, the stretchability and functions automatically recover by absorbing air moisture. The incorporation of hydrogel encapsulation enables stretchable electronics to maintain their functions and perform complex tasks, such as fire saving in soft robotics and integrated electronics sensing. With high enthalpy heat dissipation, encapsulated soft electronic devices are effectively shielded and retain their full functionality. This strategy offers a universal method for flame retardant encapsulation of stretchable electronic devices.

         <title>A Rhombic 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombic 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) Cu&#8208;TBA (TBA&#160;=&#160;octahydroxyltetrabenzoanthracene) is employed as the cathode material for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu&#8208;TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu&#8208;HHTP (HHTP&#160;=&#160;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxyltriphenylene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention as promising electroactive materials for energy storage. However, their further applications are hindered by low capacity, limited cycling life, and underutilization of the active sites. Herein, Cu&#8208;TBA (TBA&#160;=&#160;octahydroxyltetrabenzoanthracene) with large conjugation units (narrow energy gap) and a unique rhombus topology is introduced as the cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Notably, Cu&#8208;TBA with a rhombus topology exhibits a high specific surface area (613&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and metallic band structure. Additionally, Cu&#8208;TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu&#8208;HHTP (HHTP&#160;=&#160;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxyltriphenylene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work elucidates a new strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs cathode materials by narrowing the energy gap of organic linkers, effectively expanding the utilization of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for SIBs.

         <title>Kornblum Oxidation Reaction&#8208;Induced Collective Transformation of Lead Polyhalides for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that effective suppression of vacancy defects can be achieved by a rapid collective transformation of lead polyhalides through&#160;the Kornblum oxidation reaction of &#945;&#8208;iodo ketone that releases halide ions. As a result, the best thermal stability of formamidinium&#8211;cesium mixed&#8208;cation compositions (FACs)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is achieved.








Abstract
The iodide vacancy defects generated during the perovskite crystallization process are a common issue that limits the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although excessive ionic iodides have been used to compensate for these vacancies, they are not effective in reducing defects through modulating the perovskite crystallization. Moreover, these iodide ions present in the perovskite films can act as interstitial defects, which are detrimental to the stability of the perovskite. Here, an effective approach to suppress the formation of vacancy defects by manipulating the coordination chemistry of lead polyhalides during perovskite crystallization is demonstrated. To achieve this suppression, an &#945;&#8208;iodo ketone is introduced to undergo a process of Kornblum oxidation reaction that releases halide ions. This process induces a rapid collective transformation of lead polyhalides during the nucleation process and significantly reduces iodide vacancy defects. As a result, the ion mobility is decreased by one order of magnitude in perovskite film and the PSC achieves significantly improved thermal stability, maintaining 82% of its initial power conversion efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C for 2800&#160;h. These findings highlight the potential of halide ions released by the Kornblum oxidation reaction, which can be widely used for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Halide Exchange in Perovskites Enables Bromine/Iodine Hybrid Cathodes for Highly Durable Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic halide exchange is used to obtain TmdpPb2[IBr]6. It is developed as the cathode of Zn ion batteries and enables a highly reversible three&#8208;electron transfer with a high capacity of 336 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.4 A g&#8722;1 and 4000 cycles long&#8208;term operation (capacity retention: 92%).








Abstract
With the increasing need for reliable storage systems, the conversion&#8208;type chemistry typified by bromine cathodes attracts considerable attention due to sizeable theoretical capacity, cost efficiency, and high redox potential. However, the severe loss of active species during operation remains a problem, leading researchers to resort to concentrated halide&#8208;containing electrolytes. Here, profiting from the intrinsic halide exchange in perovskite lattices, a novel low&#8208;dimensional halide hybrid perovskite cathode, TmdpPb2[IBr]6, which serves not only as a halogen reservoir for reversible three&#8208;electron conversions but also as an effective halogen absorbent by surface Pb dangling bonds, C&#9472;H&#8230;Br hydrogen bonds, and Pb&#9472;I&#8230;Br halogen bonds, is proposed. As such, the Zn||TmdpPb2[IBr]6 battery delivers three remarkable discharge voltage plateaus at 1.21&#160;V (I0/I&#8722;), 1.47&#160;V (I+/I0), and 1.74&#160;V (Br0/Br&#8722;) in a typical halide&#8208;free electrolyte; meanwhile, realizing a high capacity of over 336 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.4 A g&#8722;1 and high capacity retentions of 88% and 92% after 1000 cycles at 1.2 A g&#8722;1 and 4000 cycles at 3.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively, accompanied by a high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99%. The work highlights the promising conversion&#8208;type cathodes based on metal&#8211;halide perovskite materials.

         <title>Pearl&#8208;Inspired Intelligent Marine Hetero Nanocomposite Coating Based on &#8220;Brick&amp;Mortar&#8221; Strategy: Anticorrosion Durability and Switchable Antifouling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of pearls, a novel hetero coating is obtained by incorporating heterostructures (MoS2/MXene) into polyurethane&#8208;modified PDMS (Pun). Under the hydrogen&#8208;bonded force, the hetero coating proves a unique biomimetic &#8220;brirck&amp;mortar&#8221; structure, rendering it highly effective in countering corrosive media and diverse biofouling in marine environment.








Abstract
Corrosion activities and biofouling pose significant challenges for marine facilities, resulting in substantial economic losses. Inspired by the &#8220;brick&amp;mortar&#8221; structure of pearls, a novel nanocomposite coating (Pun&#8208;HJTx) with long&#8208;lasting anticorrosion and intelligent antifouling modes is fabricated by integrating a compatible MoS2/MXene heterostructure as the &#8220;brick&#8221; into a polyurea&#8208;modified PDMS (Pun) acting as &#8220;mortar.&#8221; Notably, the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds within the coating effectively reduces the pinholes resulted from solution volatilizing. In the dark, where fouling adhesion and microbial corrosion activities are weakened, the MoS2/MXene plays a role in contact bactericidal action. Conversely, during daylight when fouling adhesion and microbial corrosion activities intensify, the coating releases reactive oxygen species (such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions) to counteract fouling adhesion. Additionally, the coating exhibits multisource self&#8208;healing performance under heated or exposed to light (maximum self&#8208;healing rate can reach 99.46%) and proves efficient self&#8208;cleaning performance and adhesion strength (&gt;2.0 Mpa), making it highly suitable for various practical marine applications. Furthermore, the outstanding performance of the Pun&#8208;HJT1 is maintained for &#8776;180 days in real&#8208;world marine conditions, which proving its practicality and feasibility in real shallow sea environments.

         <title>Structural Isomeric Effect on Spin Transport in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant difference of 700% in spin lifetimes between the structural isomers ITIC and BDTIC is observed. Experimental results and calculation demonstrate that the structural&#8208;isomeric&#8208;effect induced intramolecular noncovalent conformational locks are the direct reason for the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;coupling strength and thus decreased spin lifetime. These results will enrich the theoretical foundation for designing efficient spin&#8208;transport materials.








Abstract
Molecular semiconductor (MSC) is a promising candidate for spintronic applications benefiting from its long spin lifetime caused by light elemental&#8208;composition essence and thus weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). According to current knowledge, the SOC effect, normally dominated by the elemental composition, is the main spin&#8208;relaxation causation in MSCs, and thus the molecular structure&#8208;induced SOC change is one of the most concerned issues. In theoretical study, molecular isomerism, a most prototype phenomenon, has long been considered to possess little difference on spin transport previously, since elemental compositions of isomers are totally the same. However, here in this study, quite different spin&#8208;transport performances are demonstrated in ITIC and its structural isomers BDTIC experimentally, for the first time, though the charge transport and molecular stacking of the two films are very similar. By further experiments of electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, it is revealed that noncovalent&#8208;conformational locks (NCLs) formed in BDTIC can lead to enhancement of SOC and thus decrease the spin lifetime. Hence, this study suggests the influences from the structural&#8208;isomeric effect must be considered for developing highly efficient spin&#8208;transport MSCs, which also provides a reliable theoretical basis for solving the great challenge of quantificational measurement of NCLs in films in the future.

         <title>Toward Ultrahigh Rate and Cycling Performance of Cathode Materials of Sodium Ion Battery by Introducing a Bicontinuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered bicontinuous porous structure is introduced into Prussian blue analogues (PBA) by using polymer cubosomes as the template. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ diffusion and the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBA cathodes exhibit ultrahigh rate performance (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.5 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (&gt;3000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.5 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (&gt;3000 circulations at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA&#8208;based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes&#8217; failure due to high&#8208;stress concentration upon ion storage.

         <title>Toward Design Rules for Multilayer Ferroelectric Energy Storage Capacitors &#8211; A Study Based on Lead&#8208;Free and Relaxor&#8208;Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayer Devices</title>

Design of multilayer capacitor according to design rules for optimizing the breakdown field and energy storage capacity in the BZT/BST multilayer system, which presents an extremely large recoverable energy&#8208;storage density of 165.6&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and high energy efficiency of 93% (left). Volume and surface&#8208;area recoverable energy&#8208;storage densities for some representative dielectric capacitors in bulk, thick&#8208;film, and thin&#8208;film structures (right).








Abstract
Future pulsed&#8208;power electronic systems based on dielectric capacitors require the use of environment&#8208;friendly materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance that can operate efficiently and reliably in harsh environments. Here, a study of multilayer structures, combining paraelectric&#8208;like Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) with relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric BaZr0.4Ti0.6O3 (BZT) layers on SrTiO3&#8208;buffered Si substrates, with the goal to optimize the high energy&#8208;storage performance is presented. The energy&#8208;storage properties of various stackings are investigated and an extremely large maximum recoverable energy storage density of &#8776;165.6&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (energy efficiency&#160;&#8776;&#160;93%) is achieved for unipolar charging&#8211;discharging of a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT/20&#8208;nm&#8208;BST/910&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT/20&#8208;nm&#8208;BST/25&#8208;nm&#8208;BZT multilayer structure, due to the extremely large breakdown field of 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1 and the lack of polarization saturation at high fields in this device. Strong indications are found that the breakdown field of the devices is determined by the outer layers of the multilayer stack and can be increased by improving the quality of these layers. Authors are also able to deduce design optimization rules for this material combination, which can be to a large extend justify by structural analysis. These rules are expected also to be useful for optimizing other multilayer systems and are therefore very relevant for further increasing the energy storage density of capacitors.

         <title>An Ultrathin, Fast&#8208;Response, Large&#8208;Scale Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Facilitated Multi&#8208;Functional Reconfigurable Metasurface for Comprehensive Wavefront Modulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, ultrathin, fast&#8208;response, and large&#8208;scale millimeter&#8208;wave beamforming array is reported relying on metasurface concepts combined together with ultrathin liquid crystals. The demonstrated device, characterized by its remarkable beamforming flexibility, real&#8208;time tunability, and extensive degrees of freedom, stands to pave the way for sophisticated wavefront modulation and revolutionize the way liquid crystals can be exploited for tailoring electromagnetic waves.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of prevailing communication/sensing technologies necessitates cost&#8208;effective millimeter&#8208;wave arrays equipped with a massive number of phase&#8208;shifting cells to perform complicated beamforming tasks. Conventional approaches employing semiconductor switch/varactor components or tunable materials encounter obstacles such as quantization loss, high cost, high complexity, and limited adaptability for realizing large&#8208;scale arrays. Here, a low&#8208;cost, ultrathin, fast&#8208;response, and large&#8208;scale solution relying on metasurface concepts combined together with liquid crystal (LC) materials requiring a layer thickness of only 5&#160;&#181;m is reported. Rather than immersing resonant structures in LCs, a joint material&#8208;circuit&#8208;based strategy is devised, via integrating deep&#8208;subwavelength&#8208;thick LCs into slow&#8208;wave structures, to achieve constitutive metacells with continuous phase shifting and stable reflectivity. An LC&#8208;facilitated reconfigurable metasurface sub&#8208;system containing more than 2300 metacells is realized with its unprecedented comprehensive wavefront manipulation capacity validated through various beamforming functions, including beam focusing/steering, reconfigurable vortex beams, and tunable holograms, demonstrating a milli&#8208;second&#8208;level function&#8208;switching speed. The proposed methodology offers a paradigm shift for modulating electromagnetic waves in a non&#8208;resonating broadband fashion with fast&#8208;response and low&#8208;cost properties by exploiting functionalized LC&#8208;enabled metasurfaces. Moreover, this extremely agile metasurface&#8208;enabled antenna technology will facilitate a transformative impact on communication/sensing systems and empower new possibilities for wavefront engineering and diffractive wave calculation/inference.

         <title>Achieving Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes at Low Temperature via Regulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of THF successfully regulates electrolyte solvation structure, promotes the uniform deposition of Zn2+, reduces side reactions, and inhibits the formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits a highly cyclic stability for more than 4000&#160;h (over 5&#160;months) at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal capacity of 1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Zinc metal is an attractive anode material for rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, and freezing problem of aqueous electrolyte at low temperatures are the major roadblocks that hinder the widely commercialization of ZIBs. Herein, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is proposed as the electrolyte additive to improve the reversibility and stability of Zn anode. Theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the introduction of THF into the aqueous electrolyte can optimize the solvation structure which can effectively alleviate the H2O&#8208;induced side reactions and protect the Zn anode from corrosion. Moreover, THF can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to interact with H2O, which can greatly reduce the activity of free H2O in electrolytes and improve the low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance of Zn anode. As a result, the Zn anodes demonstrate high cyclic stability for 2800&#160;h at 27&#160;&#176;C and over 4000&#160;h at &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 /1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability and rate capability at 27 and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C. This work is expected to provide a new approach to regulate the aqueous electrolyte and Zn anode interface chemistry for highly stable and reversible Zn anodes.

         <title>A Boron, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Pure Blue Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitter for Organic Light Emitting Diodes That Shows Fast kRISC Without the Use of Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A narrowband pure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter that shows record fast kRISC on the order of 106 s&#8722;1 is demonstrated. The emitter maintains its high performance in an OLED, which shows an EQEmax of &#8776;20% and a CIEy of 0.041, matching the Rec. BT.2020&#8208;2 color point for blue.








Abstract
Narrowband emissive multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are a promising solution to achieve the current industry&#8208;targeted color standard, Rec. BT.2020&#8208;2, for blue color without using optical filters, aiming for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, their long triplet lifetimes, largely affected by their slow reverse intersystem crossing rates, adversely affect device stability. In this study, a helical MR&#8208;TADF emitter (f&#8208;DOABNA) is designed and synthesized. Owing to its &#960;&#8208;delocalized structure, f&#8208;DOABNA possesses a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap, &#916;EST, and displays simultaneously an exceptionally faster reverse intersystem crossing rate constant, kRISC, of up to 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 and a very high photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL, of over 90% in both solution and doped films. The OLED with f&#8208;DOABNA as the emitter achieved a narrow deep&#8208;blue emission at 445&#160;nm (full width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#160;nm) associated with Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.041), and showed a high maximum external quantum efficiency, EQEmax, of &#8776;20%.

         <title>Achieving Self&#8208;Reinforcing Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Nanogenerator by Magnetocaloric and Magnetization Effects of Gadolinium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging Gd&#8217;s magnetocaloric effect to absorb frictional heat enables the triboelectric nanogenerator to sustain output performance in long&#8208;term operation. Harnessing the magnetization effect of Gd to concentrate the magnetic field results in a significant enhancement in the electromagnetic generator&#8217;s outputs. The interaction of the internal components achieves a synergistic effect where 1 + 1 &gt; 2, providing a general solution for self&#8208;reinforcing hybrid generators.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (TEHG) has emerged as a promising technology for distributed energy harvesting. However, currently reported hybrid generators are straightforward combinations of two functional components. Moreover, inevitable heat from friction intensifies material abrasion and degrades the performance of polymer&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Here, a self&#8208;reinforcing TEHG (SR&#8208;TEHG) that harnesses the magnetocaloric and magnetization effects of gadolinium (Gd), is proposed. The synergy between TENG and electromagnetic generator (EMG) renders them an indivisible unit. Leveraging Gd's magnetocaloric effect, an efficient heat transfer mechanism is constructed to cool the tribolayer and strengthen the device's electrical stability. After 80 h of continuous operation, the optimized TENG occupies a charge decay rate of only 0.32% per hour, significantly outperforming most existing TENGs. Additionally, Gd's magnetization effect boosts the power of EMG by &#8776;80.84%. This work provides a universal solution in hybrid generators where internal components reinforce each other, achieving a synergistic effect of 1 + 1 &gt; 2.

         <title>Revealing the Indispensable Role of In Situ Electrochemically Reconstructed Mn(II)/Mn(III) in Improving the Performance of Lithium&#8208;Carbon Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work conduct comprehensive investigations into the underlying relationship between various Mn dual&#8208;active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The results reveal that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CO2 reduction and evolution reaction, respectively. These findings provide crucial insights for constructing effective cathodes by employing multivalent Mn&#8208;integrated hybrid catalysts.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy conversion and storage devices, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CORR/COER) kinetics. Due to the various crystal structures and unique electronic configuration, Mn&#8208;based cathode catalysts have shown considerable competition to facilitate CORR/COER. However, the specific active sites and regulation principle of Mn&#8208;based catalysts remain ambiguous and limited. Herein, this work designs novel Mn dual&#8208;active sites (MOC) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the underlying relationship between different Mn active sites and their electrochemical performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Impressively, this work finds that owing to the in situ generation and stable existence of Mn(III), MOC undergoes obvious electrochemical reconstruction during battery cycling. Moreover, a series of characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the different electronic configurations and coordination environments of Mn(II) and Mn(III) are conducive to promoting CORR and COER, respectively. Benefiting from such a modulating behavior, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries deliver a high full discharge capacity of 10.31 mAh cm&#8722;2, and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (327 cycles/1308&#160;h). This fundamental understanding of MOC reconstruction and the electrocatalytic mechanisms provides a new perspective for designing high&#8208;performance multivalent Mn&#8208;integrated hybrid catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Elucidation of Spatial Cooperativity in Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy by a Sequential Dual&#8208;pH&#8208;Responsive Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pH responsive hybrid nanoparticle (HNP) enables sequential on&#8208;site release of immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemo&#8208;drugs. HNP demonstrates an optimal spatial cooperativity to boost cDC1 activation and CD8+ T cell priming, leading to enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects with minimized immune toxicity. This study provides insights into the rational design of drug combination for future nanotherapeutics development.








Abstract
Combining immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy through nanotechnology is promising in terms of safety and efficacy. However, the distinct subcellular distribution of each ingredient's action site makes it challenging to acquire an optimal synergism. Herein, a dual&#8208;pH responsive hybrid polymeric micelle system, HNP(&#945;PDL16.9, Dox5.3), is constructed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the spatial cooperativity in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. HNP retains the inherent pH&#8208;transition of each polymer, with stepwise disassembly under discrete pH thresholds. Within weakly acidic extracellular tumor environment, &#945;PDL1 is first released to block the checkpoint on cell membranes. The remaining intact Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded micelle NP(Dox)5.3 displays significant tropism toward tumor cells and releases Dox upon lysosomal pH for efficient tumor immunogenic cell death without immune toxicity. This sequential&#8208;released pattern boosts DC activation and primes CD8+ T cells, leading to enhanced therapeutic performance than single agent or an inverse&#8208;ordered combination in multiple murine tumor models. Using HNP, the indispensable role of conventional type 1 DC (cDC1) is identified in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. A co&#8208;signature of cDC1 and CD8 correlates with cancer patient survival after neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in clinic. This study highlights spatial cooperativity of chemo&#8208; and immuno&#8208;agents in immunoregulation and provides insights into the rational design of drug combination for future nanotherapeutics development.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;stable high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheet (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) photocatalyst capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction is synthesized for the first time. The HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs due to the interplay between the different metals in the framework of the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS that enables more efficient charge transfer.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising platforms for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their fascinating physiochemical properties. Rationally engineering the compositions and structures of MOFs can provide abundant opportunities for their optimization. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have demonstrated great potential in the energy and environment fields. However, there is still no report on the development of high&#8208;entropy MOFs (HE&#8208;MOFs) for photocatalytic HER in aqueous solution. Herein, the authors report the synthesis of a novel p&#8208;type HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;single crystal (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC) and the corresponding HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;nanosheets (HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS) capable of realizing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic HER. Both HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC and HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS exhibit higher photocatalytic HER activity than all the single&#8208;metal MOFs, which are supposed to be ascribed to the interplay between the different metal nodes in the HE&#8208;MOFs&#160;that enables more efficient charge transfer. Moreover, impressively, the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS demonstrates much higher photocatalytic activity than the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;SC due to its thin thickness and enhanced surface area. At optimum conditions, the rate of H2 evolution on the HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;NS is &#8776;13.24 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is among the highest values reported for water&#8208;stable MOF photocatalysts. This work highlights the importance of developing advanced high&#8208;entropy materials toward enhanced photocatalysis.

Both HE-MOF-SC and HE-MOF-NS exhibit higher photocatalytic HER activity than all the single-metal MOFs, which are supposed to be ascribed to the interplay between the different metal nodes in the HE-MOFs&#160;that enables more efficient charge transfer. Moreover, impressively, the HE-MOF-NS demonstrates much higher photocatalytic activity than the HE-MOF-SC due to its thin thickness and enhanced surface area. At optimum conditions, the rate of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution on the HE-MOF-NS is &#8776;13.24 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is among the highest values reported for water-stable MOF photocatalysts. This work highlights the importance of developing advanced high-entropy materials toward enhanced photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Living Artificial Skin: Photosensitizer and Cell Sandwiched Bacterial Cellulose for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial skin with bacterial cellulose sandwiched between photosensitizers (PS) and functionalized living cells are bioengineered. The outermost PS layers generate reactive oxygen species to efficiently combat bacterial infections, while the inner living cell layers near the diabetic wound serve as a living factory to continuously secrete VEGF to accelerate wound repair by promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis.








Abstract
Chronic wounds pose a significant global public health challenge due to their suboptimal treatment efficacy caused by bacterial infections and microcirculatory disturbances. Inspired by the biofunctionality of natural skin, an artificial skin (HV@BC@TBG) is bioengineered with bacterial cellulose (BC) sandwiched between photosensitizers (PS) and functionalized living cells. Glucose&#8208;modified PS (TBG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;functionalized living cells (HV) are successively modified on each side of BC through biological metabolism and bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction. As the outermost layer, the TBG layer can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light illumination to efficiently combat bacterial infections. The HV layer is the inner layer near the diabetic wound, which servs as a living factory to continuously secrete VEGF to accelerate wound repair by promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis. The sandwiched structural artificial skin HV@BC@TBG is nontoxic, biocompatible, and demonstrated its ability to significantly accelerate the healing process of infected diabetic wounds, rendering it a promising next&#8208;generation medical therapy for chronic wound management.

         <title>Organizing Photosensitive and Photothermal Single&#8208;Sites Uniformly in a Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;organic framework containing uniformly distributed photosensitive and photothermal single&#8208;sites are synthesized. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 40.06 mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation without using cocatalysts or photosensitizers. The uniformly dispersed single&#8208;sites profoundly shorten the electron transfer distance at a molecular scale, promoting the electron transfer efficiently for boosting the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
Effective combination of the photosensitivity and photothermal property&#160;in photocatalyst is vital to achieve&#160;the maximum light utilization for superior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, this work successfully organizes photosensitive Cd&#8208;NS single&#8208;sites and photothermal Ni&#8208;NS single&#8208;sites uniformly at a molecular level within a tailored trimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework. The optimized Ho6&#8208;Cd0.76Ni0.24&#8208;NS exhibits a superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 40.06 mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37% at 420&#160;nm without using cocatalysts or photosensitizers. A systematical mechanism study reveals that the uniformly organized photosensitive and photothermal single&#8208;sites have synergistic effect, which form ultrashort pathways for efficient transport of photoinduced electrons, suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, hence promote the hydrogen evolution activity. This work provides a promising approach for organizing dual&#8208;functional single&#8208;sites uniformly in photocatalyst for high&#8208;performance photocatalytic activity.

         <title>A Natural Casein&#8208;Based Separator with Brick&#8208;and&#8208;Mortar Structure for Stable, High&#8208;Rate Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost pH&#8208;sensitive natural protein is used to modify GO nanosheets and a Cu2+&#8208;coordinated casein&#8208;GO composite protective layer is constructed in situ on the surface of a glass fiber separator (GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ separator) in order to inhibit the solubility and shuttling of small organic molecules, which ensures excellent cycling and rate performance of proton batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous proton batteries with small organic molecule anodes are currently considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, stable safety, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application is limited by the poor cycling stability caused by the shuttling of soluble organic molecules between electrodes. Herein, a cell separator is modified by a GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ layer with a brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar structure to inhibit the shuttling of small organic molecules. Experimental and calculation results indicate that, attributed to the synergistic effect of physical blocking of casein molecular chains and electrostatic and coordination interactions of Cu2+, bulk dissolution and shuttling of multiple small molecules can be inhibited simultaneously, while H+ transfer across the separators is not almost affected. With the protection of the GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ separator, soluble small molecules, such as diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine,2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacyano (6CN&#8208;DQPZ) exhibit a high reversible capacity of 262.6 mA h g&#8722;1 and amazing stability (capacity retention of 92.9% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). In addition, this strategy is also proved available to other active conjugated small molecules, such as indanthrone (IDT), providing a general green sustainable strategy for advancing the use of small organic molecule electrodes in proton cells.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Polymerization of Dendritic Agents for Hijacking Lysosomes and Enhancing Antigen Presentation in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;generation dendritic agent is developed to cause lysosomal dysfunction and improve antigen presentation and antitumor immunity. The dendrimers undergo glutathione&#8208;mediated in situ polymerization and aggregation into large particles with a high positive charge, thereby causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, enhanced major histocompatibility complex class I expression and camptothecin release, followed by dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation.








Abstract
A low&#8208;generation lysine dendrimer, SPr&#8208;G2, responds to intracellular glutathione to initiate bioorthogonal in situ polymerization, resulting in the formation of large assemblies in mouse breast cancer cells. The intracellular large assemblies of SPr&#8208;G2 can interact with lysosomes to induce lysosome expansion and enhance lysosomal membrane permeabilization, leading to major histocompatibility complex class I upregulation on tumor cell surfaces and ultimately tumor cell death. Moreover, the use of the SPr&#8208;G2 dendrimer to conjugate the chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin (CPT), can boost the therapeutic potency of CPT. Excellent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo are obtained from the combinational treatment of the SPr&#8208;G2 dendrimer and CPT. This combinational effect also enhances antitumor immunity through promoting activation of cytotoxic T cells in tumor tissues and maturation of dendritic cells. This study can shed new light on the development of peptide dendritic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Water Catchers within Sub&#8208;Nano Channels Promote Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Zinc&#8208;Ion Dehydration Enable Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Porous material containing various water&#8208;capturing carboxyl groups within its sub&#8208;nano channels is found can facilitate the step&#8208;by&#8208;step dehydration of zinc&#8208;ions, promote the formation of an aggregative aqueous electrolyte (super&#8208;saturated), which consequently eliminate water&#8208;induced corrosion and side&#8208;reactions. More importantly, the functionalized channels can also act as ion rectifiers and promote fast but even Zn&#8208;ions transport, thus leading to a dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal.








Abstract
Zinc metal suffers from violent and long&#8208;lasting water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrollable dendritic Zn growth, which seriously reduce the coulombic efficiency (CE) and lifespan of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). To suppress the corresponding harmful effects of the highly active water, a stable zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with water catchers decorated inside its sub&#8208;nano channels is used to protect Zn&#8208;metal. Water catchers within narrow channels can constantly trap water molecules from the solvated Zn&#8208;ions and facilitate step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation/dehydration, thereby promoting the formation of an aggregative electrolyte configuration, which consequently eliminates water&#8208;induced corrosion and side reactions. More importantly, the functionalized sub&#8208;nano channels also act as ion rectifiers and promote fast but even Zn&#8208;ions transport, thereby leading to a dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal. As a result, the protected Zn metal demonstrates an unprecedented cycling stability of more than 10&#160;000 h and an ultra&#8208;high average CE of 99.92% during 4000 cycles. More inspiringly, a practical NH4V4O10//Zn pouch&#8208;cell is fabricated and delivers a capacity of 98 mAh (under high cathode mass loading of 25.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and preserves 86.2% capacity retention after 150 cycles. This new strategy in promoting highly reversible Zn metal anodes would spur the practical utilization of AZMBs.

         <title>Lamellar Nanoporous Metal/Intermetallic Compound Heterostructure Regulating Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electrodeposition for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure electrodes with high electron/ion transportability and abundant zincophilic sites are constructed as high&#8208;performance anode host materials for wide&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc ion batteries. Benefiting from the unique metal/intermetallic compound heterostructure to form local galvanic couples to facilitate Zn nucleation and deposition, nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu electrode exhibits ultralong&#8208;lifespan stability at 25 and &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are attractive post&#8208;lithium battery technologies for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their inherent safety, low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, their practical implementation in wide&#8208;temperature surroundings persistently confronts irregular zinc electrodeposits and parasitic side reactions on metal anode, which leads to poor rechargeability, low Coulombic efficiency and short lifespan. Here, this work reports lamellar nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure electrode as a promising anode host material to regulate high&#8208;efficiency and dendrite&#8208;free zinc electrodeposition and stripping for wide&#8208;temperatures aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In this unique electrode, the interconnective Cu/Al2Cu heterostructure ligaments not only facilitate fast electron transfer but work as highly zincophilic sites for zinc nucleation and deposition by virtue of local galvanic couples while the interpenetrative lamellar channels serving as mass transport pathways. As a result, it exhibits exceptional zinc plating/stripping behaviors in aqueous hybrid electrolyte of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate at wide temperatures ranging from 25 to &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, with ultralow voltage polarizations at various current densities and ultralong lifespan of &gt;4000 h. The outstanding electrochemical properties enlist full cell of zinc&#8208;ion batteries constructed with nanoporous Cu/Al2Cu and ZnxV2O5/C to maintain high capacity and excellent stability for &gt;5000 cycles at 25 and &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Interface as a Cell Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell culturing at hydrophobic molecular liquids, such as fluorinated carbon and silicones, is attracting attention as a fundamental technology for highly efficient growth of useful cell resources. Here, it is attempted to utilize physicochemical property designable ionic liquid (IL) interface for cell culture, which provides a unique liquid | liquid interface that is highly polar but phase&#8208;separated from water.








Abstract
In sharp contrast to conventional solid/hydrogel platforms, water&#8208;immiscible liquids, such as perfluorocarbons and silicones, allow the adhesion of mammalian cells via protein nanolayers (PNLs) formed at the interface. However, fluorocarbons and silicones, which are typically used for liquid cell culture, possess only narrow ranges of physicochemical parameters and have not allowed for a wide variety of cell culturing environments. In this paper, it is proposed that water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquids (ILs) are a new family of liquid substrates with tunable physicochemical properties and high solvation capabilities. Tetraalkylphosphonium&#8208;based ILs are identified as non&#8208;cytotoxic ILs, whereon human mesenchymal stem cells are successfully cultured. By reducing the cation charge distribution, or ionicity, via alkyl chain elongation, the interface allows cell spreading with matured focal contacts. High&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy observations of the PNL formation process suggest that the cation charge distribution significantly altered the protein adsorption dynamics, which are associated with the degree of protein denaturation and the PNL mechanics. Moreover, by exploiting dissolution capability of ILs, an ion&#8208;gel cell scaffold is fabricated. This enables to further identify the significant contribution of bulk subphase mechanics to cellular mechanosensing in liquid&#8208;based culture scaffolds.

         <title>Guest Acceptors with Lower Electrostatic Potential in Ternary Organic Solar Cells for Minimizing Voltage Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key strategy for predicting efficient guest components to minimize voltage losses in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) is demonstrated. The larger electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the guest acceptor and the host acceptor, the smaller non&#8208;radiative voltage losses.








Abstract
The ternary strategy, in which one guest component is introduced into one host binary system, is considered to be one of the most effective ways to realize high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, there is no efficient method to predict the effectiveness of guest components in ternary OSCs. Herein, three guest compositions (i.e., ANF&#8208;1, ANF&#8208;2 and ANF&#8208;3) with different electrostatic potential (ESP) are designed and synthesized by modulating the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the terminal groups through density functional theory simulations. The effects of the introduction of guest component into the host system (D18:N3) on the photovoltaic properties are investigated. The theoretical and experimental studies provide a key rule for guest acceptor in ternary OSCs to improve the open&#8208;circuit voltage, that is, the larger ESP difference between the guest and host acceptor, the stronger the intermolecular interactions and the higher the miscibility, which improves the luminescent efficiency of the blend film and the electroluminescence quantum yield (EQEEL) of the device by reducing the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching, thereby effectively decreasing the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of ternary OSCs. This work will greatly contribute to the development of highly efficient guest components, thereby promoting the rapid breakthrough of the 20% efficiency bottleneck for single&#8208;junction OSCs.

Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies are synthesized by a facile ion extraction strategy. The Cu0.54In1.15Se2 exhibits excellent cycling and rate performance as an anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its distinct ordered vacancy structure, which cannot only serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps to achieve a homogeneous distribution of Na+ but also boost the sodium ion diffusion.








Abstract
Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;C and a high&#8208;rate stability of 311.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal&#8208;ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.

Radioimmunotherapy
Genome editing has the potential to remodel the immunogenicity of cancer cells, thereby enhancing the efficacy of anti&#8208;tumour immunotherapy. However, the plasma membrane presents a challenge as it impedes the entry of the genome&#8208;editing agent. In article number 2401384, Qinyang Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a bioinspired sonoporation system to open the cell membrane for aiding genome editing in vitro and in vivo.

Ionic Liquid Interface
Cell culture at the liquid interface has been attracting attention as an aspect of mechanobiology. In article number 2310105, Takeshi Ueki, Jun Nakanishi, and co&#8208;workers propose ionic liquid interface as a novel liquid cell culture platform. Phenotype of cells is determined by the mechanical properties of protein nanolayers which is depended on the chemical structure of the ionic liquid.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2313226, Ann E. Metzloff, Michael J. Mitchell, and co&#8208;workers develop activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) for cancer immunotherapy. In this image, aLNPs (red), equipped with surface molecules that mimic antigen presenting cells, facilitate rapid, one&#8208;step activation and transfection of human T cells (gray) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) mRNA. The resulting CAR T cells (yellow) eradicate cancer cells (green). aLNPs could reduce the complexity, cost, and time of mRNA CAR T cell production.

Mechanical and Functional Responses in Astrocytes
Astrocytes respond to mechanical actuation changing their structure, mechanical properties and functional activity. A magneto&#8208;mechanical system simulates traumatic brain injury and stroke&#8208;induced substrate deformations in vitro. These time&#8208;evolving deformations lead to intertwined remodeling of actin cytoskeleton modulating the mechanical properties of the cell and activating Piezo1. These coordinated changes may influence the protective role of astrocytes for neighboring neurons. More details can be found in article number 2312497 by Daniel Garcia&#8208;Gonzalez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Arising 2D Perovskites for Ionizing Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse organic cations of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D perovskites endow them tunable optoelectronic characteristics. 2D perovskites have achieved great progress in the field of radiation detection in the past five years. The progress of 2D perovskites is systematically reviewed in X&#8208;rays, &#947;&#8208;rays, &#945;&#8208;particles, &#946;&#8208;particles, and neutrons, and an outlook on the future development is made.








Abstract
2D perovskites have greatly improved moisture stability owing to the large organic cations embedded in the inorganic octahedral structure, which also suppresses the ions migration and reduces the dark current. The suppression of ions migration by 2D perovskites effectively suppresses excessive device noise and baseline drift and shows excellent potential in the direct X&#8208;ray detection field. In addition, 2D perovskites have gradually emerged with many unique properties, such as anisotropy, tunable bandgap, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and wide range exciton binding energy, which continuously promote the development of 2D perovskites in ionizing radiation detection. This review aims to systematically summarize the advances and progress of 2D halide perovskite semiconductor and scintillator ionizing radiation detectors, including reported alpha (&#945;) particle, beta (&#946;) particle, neutron, X&#8208;ray, and gamma (&#947;) ray detection. The unique structural features of 2D perovskites and their advantages in X&#8208;ray detection are discussed. Development directions are also proposed to overcome the limitations of 2D halide perovskite radiation detectors.

&lt;p&gt;The diverse organic cations of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D perovskites endow them tunable optoelectronic characteristics. 2D perovskites have achieved great progress in the field of radiation detection in the past five years. The progress of 2D perovskites is systematically reviewed in X-rays, &#947;-rays, &#945;-particles, &#946;-particles, and neutrons, and an outlook on the future development is made.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D perovskites have greatly improved moisture stability owing to the large organic cations embedded in the inorganic octahedral structure, which also suppresses the ions migration and reduces the dark current. The suppression of ions migration by 2D perovskites effectively suppresses excessive device noise and baseline drift and shows excellent potential in the direct X-ray detection field. In addition, 2D perovskites have gradually emerged with many unique properties, such as anisotropy, tunable bandgap, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and wide range exciton binding energy, which continuously promote the development of 2D perovskites in ionizing radiation detection. This review aims to systematically summarize the advances and progress of 2D halide perovskite semiconductor and scintillator ionizing radiation detectors, including reported alpha (&#945;) particle, beta (&#946;) particle, neutron, X-ray, and gamma (&#947;) ray detection. The unique structural features of 2D perovskites and their advantages in X-ray detection are discussed. Development directions are also proposed to overcome the limitations of 2D halide perovskite radiation detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomedicine Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicine is a popular and productive research field. Nanomedicine formulations are widely explored to improve tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery and anticancer treatment efficacy. The clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines has been lagging behind expectations, for several reasons. This perspective paper discusses the basic principles, relevant recent progress, currently used clinical products, prominent problems, and most promising future prospects of cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively explored for cancer therapy. By delivering drug molecules more efficiently to pathological sites and by attenuating their accumulation in healthy organs and tissues, nanomedicine formulations aim to improve the balance between drug efficacy and toxicity. More than 20 cancer nanomedicines are approved for clinical use, and hundreds of formulations are in (pre)clinical development. Over the years, several key pitfalls have been identified as bottlenecks in nanomedicine tumor targeting and translation. These go beyond materials&#8208; and production&#8208;related issues, and particularly also encompass biological barriers and pathophysiological heterogeneity. In this manuscript, the author describes the most important principles, progress, and products in nanomedicine tumor targeting, delineates key current problems and challenges, and discusses the most promising future prospects to create clinical impact.

Material technology presents great potentials in leukemia treatment. This review summarizes the types, physicochemical properties, as well as functions of various materials generally utilized in leukemia treatments, and highlights the current applications of these materials in diverse leukemia treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, radiotherapy, reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;based therapy, and combined therapy.








Abstract
Leukemia is a widespread hematological malignancy characterized by an elevated white blood cell count in both the blood and the bone marrow. Despite notable advancements in leukemia intervention in the clinic, a large proportion of patients, especially acute leukemia patients, fail to achieve long&#8208;term remission or complete remission following treatment. Therefore, leukemia therapy necessitates optimization to meet the treatment requirements. In recent years, a multitude of materials have undergone rigorous study to serve as delivery vectors or direct intervention agents to bolster the effectiveness of leukemia therapy. These materials include liposomes, protein&#8208;based materials, polymeric materials, cell&#8208;derived materials, and inorganic materials. They possess unique characteristics and are applied in a broad array of therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and other evolving treatments. Here, an overview of these materials is presented, describing their physicochemical properties, their role in leukemia treatment, and the challenges they face in the context of clinical translation. This review inspires researchers to further develop various materials that can be used to augment the efficacy of multiple therapeutic modalities for novel applications in leukemia treatment.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, significant progress in piezo&#8208;/triboelectric nanogenerators (PTEGs) has led to the development of cutting&#8208;edge wearable technologies. Nanofibers with good designability, controllable morphologies, large specific areas, and unique physicochemical properties provide a promising platform for PTEGs for various advanced applications. However, the further development of nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs is limited by technical difficulties, ranging from materials design to device integration. Herein, the current developments in PTEGs based on electrospun nanofibers are systematically reviewed. This review begins with the mechanisms of PTEGs and the advantages of nanofibers and nanodevices, including high breathability, waterproofness, scalability, and thermal&#8211;moisture comfort. In terms of materials and structural design, novel electroactive nanofibers and structure assemblies based on 1D micro/nanostructures, 2D bionic structures, and 3D multilayered structures are discussed. Subsequently, nanofibrous PTEGs in applications such as energy harvesters, personalized medicine, personal protective equipment, and human&#8211;machine interactions are summarized. Nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs still face many challenges such as energy efficiency, material durability, device stability, and device integration. Finally, the research gap between research and practical applications of PTEGs is discussed, and emerging trends are proposed, providing some ideas for the development of intelligent wearables.

Abstract
In the era of the Internet and the Internet of Things, display technology has evolved significantly toward full&#8208;scene display and realistic display. Incorporating &#8220;intelligence&#8221; into displays is a crucial technical approach to meet the demands of this development. Traditional display technology relies on distributed hardware systems to achieve intelligent displays but encounters challenges stemming from the physical separation of sensing, processing, and light&#8208;emitting modules. The high energy consumption and data transformation delays limited the development of intelligence display, breaking the physical separation is crucial to overcoming the bottlenecks of intelligence display technology. Inspired by the biological neural system, neuromorphic technology with all&#8208;in&#8208;one features is widely employed across various fields. It proves effective in reducing system power consumption, facilitating frequent data transformation, and enabling cross&#8208;scene integration. Neuromorphic technology shows great potential to overcome display technology bottlenecks, realizing the full&#8208;scene display and realistic display with high efficiency and low power consumption. This review offers a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in the application of neuromorphic technology in displays, with a focus on interoperability. This work delves into its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art designs and potential future developments aimed at revolutionizing display technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of the Internet and the Internet of Things, display technology has evolved significantly toward full-scene display and realistic display. Incorporating &#8220;intelligence&#8221; into displays is a crucial technical approach to meet the demands of this development. Traditional display technology relies on distributed hardware systems to achieve intelligent displays but encounters challenges stemming from the physical separation of sensing, processing, and light-emitting modules. The high energy consumption and data transformation delays limited the development of intelligence display, breaking the physical separation is crucial to overcoming the bottlenecks of intelligence display technology. Inspired by the biological neural system, neuromorphic technology with all-in-one features is widely employed across various fields. It proves effective in reducing system power consumption, facilitating frequent data transformation, and enabling cross-scene integration. Neuromorphic technology shows great potential to overcome display technology bottlenecks, realizing the full-scene display and realistic display with high efficiency and low power consumption. This review offers a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in the application of neuromorphic technology in displays, with a focus on interoperability. This work delves into its state-of-the-art designs and potential future developments aimed at revolutionizing display technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward the High&#8208;Voltage Stability of Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Challenges, Progress, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered oxide cathodes (LOCs) encounter significant challenges when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions (&gt; 4.0&#160;V versus Na+/Na) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this review, the prominent challenges and the recent efforts made to improve the high&#8208;voltage stability of LOCs are highlighted. Moreover, the future directions and prospects of LOCs are outlined for enabling high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention as ideal candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their notable advantages in terms of resource availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, there remains a substantial energy density gap between SIBs and commercially available lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), posing challenges to meeting the requirements of practical applications. The fabrication of high&#8208;energy cathodes has emerged as an efficient approach to enhancing the energy density of SIBs, which commonly requires cathodes operating in high&#8208;voltage regions. Layered oxide cathodes (LOCs), with low cost, facile synthesis, and high theoretical specific capacity, have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications. However, LOCs encounter significant challenges when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions such as irreversible phase transitions, migration and dissolution of metal cations, loss of reactive oxygen, and the occurrence of serious interfacial parasitic reactions. These issues ultimately result in severe degradation in battery performance. This review aims to shed light on the key challenges and failure mechanisms encountered by LOCs when operated in high&#8208;voltage regions. Additionally, the corresponding strategies for improving the high&#8208;voltage stability of LOCs are comprehensively summarized. By providing fundamental insights and valuable perspectives, this review aims to contribute to the advancement of high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Direct Laser Writing: From Materials Synthesis and Conversion to Electronic Device Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers recent progress and breakthroughs in direct laser writing for multimaterial synthesis and conversion, toward processing and fabrication of electronics. Predominant laser&#8208;material processing mechanisms for the writing of conductive and semiconductive materials are discussed, alongside important considerations on laser operation and implementation for both rigid and flexible electronics, including microelectronics, energy harvesting and storage, sensors, and bioelectronics.








Abstract
Direct Laser Writing (DLW) has been increasingly selected as a microfabrication route for efficient, cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution material synthesis and conversion. Concurrently, lasers participate in the patterning and assembly of functional geometries in several fields of application, of which electronics stand out. In this review, recent advances and strategies based on DLW for electronics microfabrication are surveyed and outlined, based on laser material growth strategies. First, the main DLW parameters influencing material synthesis and transformation mechanisms are summarized, aimed at selective, tailored writing of conductive and semiconducting materials. Additive and transformative DLW processing mechanisms are discussed, to open space to explore several categories of materials directly synthesized or transformed for electronics microfabrication. These include metallic conductors, metal oxides, transition metal chalcogenides and carbides, laser&#8208;induced graphene, and their mixtures. By accessing a wide range of material types, DLW&#8208;based electronic applications are explored, including processing components, energy harvesting and storage, sensing, and bioelectronics. The expanded capability of lasers to participate in multiple fabrication steps at different implementation levels, from material engineering to device processing, indicates their future applicability to next&#8208;generation electronics, where more accessible, green microfabrication approaches integrate lasers as comprehensive tools.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells: Mechanisms, Status, and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique review logic focusing on the working mechanisms governing perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO&#8208;TSCs) is explored as the fundamental solution. The optimization of perovskite absorber, organic absorber, and interconnection layer as pivotal strategies for maximizing the device performance is in&#8208;depth analyzed.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (PO&#8208;TSCs) demonstrate exceptional suitability for emerging applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, wearable devices, and greenhouse farming. By leveraging the distinctive attributes of perovskite and organic materials, which encompass expanded solar spectrum utilization, chemically benign solubility, and soft nature, PO&#8208;TSCs position themselves as ideal candidates for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent photovoltaics (ST&#8208;PVs). Despite these advantages, their development significantly lags behind other perovskite&#8208;based counterparts, such as perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, and perovskite/Cu(In, Ga)Se2. To address existing challenges and unlock the full potential of PO&#8208;TSCs, an exploration of the fundamental mechanisms governing tandem photovoltaic devices is embarked. Delving into critical aspects such as charge generation/separation, energy level alignment, and material choices becomes pivotal for optimizing PO&#8208;TSC performance. The investigation of monolithic two&#8208;terminal PO&#8208;TSCs offers insights into achievements and barriers, recognizing the competitive landscape with other TSC counterparts. Further scrutiny of perovskite absorbers and organic absorbers in TSCs reveals strategies aimed at enhancing stability and efficiency. The discussion extends to interconnection layers, elucidating their role in optimizing light transmission and balancing carrier recombination. In conclusion, a compelling outlook on the dynamic landscape of PO&#8208;TSCs is presented, highlighting the remarkable efficiency progression and signaling their potential to revolutionize solar energy harvesting technologies.

Schematic diagram of cell membrane based biomimetic nanosystems constructed using different sources of cell membranes (e.g., erythrocyte membranes, stem cell membranes, tumor cell membranes, etc.) and different types of nanoparticles (including organic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and polymers) for therapeutic neurological care.








Abstract
Brain disorders represent a significant challenge in medical science due to the formidable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which severely limits the penetration of conventional therapeutics, hindering effective treatment strategies. This review delves into the innovative realm of biomimetic nanodelivery systems, including stem cell&#8208;derived nanoghosts, tumor cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, and erythrocyte membrane&#8208;based carriers, highlighting their potential to circumvent the BBB's restrictions. By mimicking native cell properties, these nanocarriers emerge as a promising solution for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, offering a strategic advantage in overcoming the barrier's selective permeability. The unique benefits of leveraging cell membranes from various sources is evaluated and advanced technologies for fabricating cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles capable of masquerading as endogenous cells are examined. This enables the targeted delivery of a broad spectrum of therapeutic agents, ranging from small molecule drugs to proteins, thereby providing an innovative approach to neurocare. Further, the review contrasts the capabilities and limitations of these biomimetic nanocarriers with traditional delivery methods, underlining their potential to enable targeted, sustained, and minimally invasive treatment modalities. This review is concluded with a perspective on the clinical translation of these biomimetic systems, underscoring their transformative impact on the therapeutic landscape for intractable brain diseases.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Drug Coordination Nanoparticles and Hydrogels for Enhanced Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 26, June 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many drug molecules are rich in metal coordination sites and they can form nanomaterials and soft materials, such as hydrogels upon coordination with various metal ions, allowing higher drug loading efficiency compared to adsorption based loading. At the same time, these materials allow controlled drug release and convenient delivery for treating a range of diseases.








Abstract
Drug delivery is a key component of nanomedicine, and conventional delivery relies on the adsorption or encapsulation of drug molecules to a nanomaterial. Many delivery vehicles contain metal ions, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXene, and noble metal nanoparticles. These materials have a high metal content and pose potential long&#8208;term toxicity concerns leading to difficulties for clinical approval. In this review, recent developments are summarized in the use of drug molecules as ligands for metal coordination forming various nanomaterials and soft materials. In these cases, the drug&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio is much higher than conventional adsorption&#8208;based strategies. The drug molecules are divided into small&#8208;molecule drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins. The formed hybrid materials mainly include nanoparticles and hydrogels, upon which targeting ligands can be grafted to improve efficacy and further decrease toxicity. The application of these materials for addressing cancer, viral infection, bacterial infection inflammatory bowel disease, and bone diseases is reviewed. In the end, some future directions are discussed from fundamental research, materials science, and medicine.

         <title>A &#8220;Liquid&#8208;In&#8208;Solid&#8221; Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Breaking through the Na+ transport channel of Na&#8208;containing zeolite molecular sieve by ion&#8208;exchange and confining aggregated liquid ether electrolytes in the nanopore and void of zeolites, it achieves excellent high&#8208;voltage stability enabled by solid&#8208;state zeolite electrolytes, while inheriting the ultra&#8208;high CE (99.84%) from liquid ether electrolytes.








Abstract
Developing anode&#8208;free batteries is the ultimate goal in pursuit of high energy density and safety. It is more urgent for sodium (Na)&#8208;based batteries due to its inherently low energy density and safety hazards induced by highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, there is no electrolyte that can meet the demanding Na plating&#8208;stripping Coulomb efficiency (CE) while resisting oxidative decomposition at high voltages for building stable anode&#8208;free Na batteries. Here, a &#8220;liquid&#8208;in&#8208;solid&#8221; electrolyte design strategy is proposed to integrate target performances of liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Breaking through the Na+ transport channel of Na&#8208;containing zeolite molecular sieve by ion&#8208;exchange and confining aggregated liquid ether electrolytes in the nanopore and void of zeolites, it achieves excellent high&#8208;voltage stability enabled by solid&#8208;state zeolite electrolytes, while inheriting the ultra&#8208;high CE (99.84%) from liquid ether electrolytes. When applied in a 4.25&#160;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free Na battery, an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 412&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 (based on the active material of both cathodes and anodes) can be reached, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled anode&#8208;free pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, and a high capacity retention of 89.2% can be preserved after 370 cycles.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanically Stable and Sodiophilic Interface for Na Metal Anode in Liquid&#8208;based and Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Abstract
Na metal batteries (NMBs) are attracting increasing attention because of their high energy density. However, the widespread application of NMBs has been hindered by the growth of Na dendrites and interface instability. The design of artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with tuned chemical/electrochemical/mechanical properties is the key to achieving high&#8208;performance NMBs. In this work, we developed a metal&#8208;doped nanoscale polymeric film with tunable composition, sodiophilic sites and improved stiffness. The incorporation of metal crosslinkers in the polymer chains results in exceptional electrochemical stability for Na metal anodes, leading to a significantly prolonged lifespan even at high current densities, which is at the top of the reported literature. The mechanical properties measurements and electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical phase&#8208;field model are performed to interpret the impact of the ionic transportation capability (decoupled mechanical) and mechanic property in the metal&#8208;doped polymer interface. In addition, our approach provides a promising strategy for the rational design of electrode interfaces, providing enhanced mechanical stability and improved sodiophilicity, which can open up opportunities for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) based on 2D materials like graphene/boron nitride, pivotal for heat management in advanced electronics. Focusing on their structural attributes, properties, and applications, it differentiates from other reviews by emphasizing their developmental history, addressing critical challenges, and proposing solutions.

Abstract
The challenges associated with heat dissipation in high&#8208;power electronic devices used in communication, new energy, and aerospace equipment have spurred an urgent need for high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) to establish efficient heat transfer pathways from the heater (chip) to heat sinks. Recently, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and boron nitride, renowned for their ultrahigh basal&#8208;plane thermal conductivity and the capacity to facilitate cross&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;morphic structural design, have found widespread use as thermal fillers in the production of high&#8208;performance TIMs. To deepen the understanding of 2D material&#8208;based TIMs, this review focuses primarily on graphene and boron nitride&#8208;based TIMs, exploring their structures, properties, and applications. Building on this foundation, the developmental history of these TIMs is emphasized and a detailed analysis of critical challenges and potential solutions is provided. Additionally, the preparation and application of some other novel 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs are briefly introduced, aiming to offer constructive guidance for the future development of high&#8208;performance TIMs.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based Polymer Organic Cathode for Extreme Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Ultralong Lifespans</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion and electron transport issues in active materials must be smoothed out to build fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Fast ion transport in the Fc&#8208;SO3Li electrode is achieved through careful structural design. The Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNTX is prepared by insitu polymerization with carbon nanotube, which further improves the electron transport. Fc&#8208;SO3Li and Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNT50 can achieve high energy density and ultralong cycles under ultrafast charging.








Abstract
To meet the growing demand for energy storage, lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with fast charging capabilities has emerged as a critical technology. The electrode materials affect the rate performance significantly. Organic electrodes with structural flexibility support fast lithium&#8208;ion transport and are considered promising candidates for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. However, it is a challenge to create organic electrodes that can cycle steadily and reach high energy density in a few minutes. To solve this issue, accelerating the transport of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode is the key. Here, it is demonstrated that a ferrocene&#8208;based polymer electrode (Fc&#8208;SO3Li) can be used as a fast&#8208;charging organic electrode for LIBs. Thanks to its molecular architecture, LIBs with Fc&#8208;SO3Li show exceptional cycling stability (99.99% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) and reach an energy density of 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in 72 seconds. Moreover, the composite material through in&#160;situ polymerization with Fc&#8208;SO3Li and 50 wt % carbon nanotube (denoted as Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNT50) achieved optimized electron and ion transport pathways. After 10&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 50C, it delivered a high energy density of 304&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This study provides valuable insights into designing cathode materials for LIBs that combine high power and ultralong cycle life.

         <title>Filter&#8208;Less Color&#8208;Selective Photodetector Derived from Integration of Parallel Perovskite Photoelectric Response Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The color&#8208;selective photodetector is fabricated through integrating three units with different photoresponse on one chip, which is modulated by varying the electron transportation layer SnS2 through ultrasonic treatment, modulating the photogenerated carrier rate distribution and energy band alignment. Based on differences in spectral response, integrated three units can identify colors in polychromatic light to achieve color imaging.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective photodetectors (PDs) play an indispensable role in spectral recognition, image sensing, and other fields. Nevertheless, complex filters and delicate optical paths in such devices significantly increase their complexity and size, which subsequently impede their integration in smart optoelectronic chips for universal applications. This work demonstrates the successful fabrication of filter&#8208;less color&#8208;selective perovskite PDs by integrating three perovskite units with different photoresponse on a single chip. The variation in photoresponse is attributed to different quantities of SnO2 nanoparticles, synthesized through controlled ultrasonic treatment on the surface of the electron transportation layer SnS2, which selectively absorb short&#8208;wavelength light, thus increasing the relative transmittance of long&#8208;wavelength light and enhancing the photoresponse of the units to long wavelengths. By integrating any two units and deriving the formula for the wavelength to the responsivity ratio, a wavelength sensor is developed which can accurately identify incident light in the range of 400&#8211;700&#160;nm with a minimum error &lt;3&#160;nm. Furthermore, the device integrating three units with different photoresponse can identify red, green and blue in polychromatic light to achieve color imaging with a relative error &lt;6%. This work provides valuable insights into wavelength identification and color imaging of perovskite PDs.

         <title>Nanozybiotics: Advancing Antimicrobial Strategies Through Biomimetic Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozybiotics have emerged as a new generation of antimicrobial candidates based on nanozymes that mimic the catalytic killing mode of the innate immune defense system against infectious pathogens. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their development and application, including classification, antimicrobial mechanisms, recent advancements in antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal treatments, potential translational applications, critical challenges, and future prospects.








Abstract
Infectious diseases caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens present significant global health challenges. The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance exacerbates this issue, leading to a scenario where effective antibiotics are increasingly scarce. Traditional antibiotic development strategies are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of microbial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial strategies with mechanisms distinct from those of existing antibiotics. Nanozybiotics, which are nanozyme&#8208;based antimicrobials, mimic the catalytic action of lysosomal enzymes in innate immune cells to kill infectious pathogens. This review reinforces the concept of nanozymes and provides a comprehensive summary of recent research advancements on potential antimicrobial candidates. Initially, nanozybiotics are categorized based on their activities, mimicking either oxidoreductase&#8208;like or hydrolase&#8208;like functions, thereby highlighting their superior mechanisms in combating antimicrobial resistance. The review then discusses the progress of nanozybiotics in treating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, confirming their potential as novel antimicrobial candidates. The translational potential of nanozybiotic&#8208;based products, including hydrogels, nanorobots, sprays, bandages, masks, and protective clothing, is also considered. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of nanozybiotic&#8208;related products are explored, emphasizing the design and antimicrobial capabilities of nanozybiotics for future applications.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive &#946;&#8208;Glucans&#8208;Complexed mRNA in LNPs as an Oral Vaccine for Enhancing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon oral administration of &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs, the pH&#8208;responsive partial dissociation/reassociation behavior of &#946;Glus/mRNA complexes within LNPs effectively shields mRNA from degradation in the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment. &#946;Glus serve as both a protective agent and an adjuvant, facilitating stable delivery into GI&#8208;resident dendritic cells and non&#8208;antigen presenting cells for translation into tumor&#8208;associated antigens. This process initiates antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against tumors.








Abstract
mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy are commonly delivered using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which, when administered intravenously, may accumulate in the liver, potentially limiting their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this challenge, the study introduces an oral mRNA vaccine formulation tailored for efficient uptake by immune cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, known for its high concentration of immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). This formulation comprises mRNA complexed with &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus), a potential adjuvant for vaccines, encapsulated within LNPs (&#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs). The &#946;Glus/mRNA complexes within the small compartments of LNPs demonstrate a distinctive ability to partially dissociate and reassociate, responding to pH changes, effectively shielding mRNA from degradation in the harsh GI environment. Upon oral administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs are effectively taken up by intestinal DCs and local nonimmune cells, bypassing potential liver accumulation. This initiates antigen&#8208;specific immune responses through successful mRNA translation, followed by drainage into the mesenteric lymph nodes to stimulate T cells and trigger specific adaptive immune responses, ultimately enhancing antitumor effects. Importantly, the vaccine demonstrates safety, with no significant inflammatory reactions observed. In conclusion, the potential of oral &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs delivery presents a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy, offering needle&#8208;free and user&#8208;friendly administration for widespread adoption and self&#8208;administration.

         <title>2D Photonic Colloidal Liquid Crystals Composed of Self&#8208;Assembled Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals comprised of biomineral/polymer nanorod hybrids dispersed in water are presented. These colloidal liquid crystals display vibrant structural colors with remarkable reflectance and pronounced angular dependence. The coloration is finely adjusted by modulating the concentration and size of the nanorods. Furthermore, these colloidal liquid crystals are immobilized in organic polymer network, showcasing mechanochromic properties with angular dependency.








Abstract
Photonic crystals, characterized by their periodic structures, have been extensively studied for their ability to manipulate light. Typically, the development of 2D photonic crystals requires either sophisticated equipment or precise orientation of spherical nanoparticles. However, liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) materials offer a promising alternative, facilitating the formation of periodic structures without the need for complex manipulation. Despite this advantage, the development of 2D photonic periodic structures using LC materials is limited to a few colloidal nanodisk liquid crystals. Herein, 2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals composed of biomineral&#8208;based nanorods and water is reported. The soft photonic materials with 2D structure by self&#8208;assembled LC colloidal nanorods are unique and a new class of photonic materials different from conventional solid 2D photonic materials. These colloids exhibit bright structural colors with high reflectance (&gt;50%) and significant angular dependency. The structural colors are adjusted by controlling the concentration and size of the LC colloidal nanorods. Furthermore, mechanochromic hydrogel thin films with 2D photonic structure are developed. The hydrogels exhibit reversible mechanochromic properties with angular dependency, which can be used for an advanced stimuli responsible sensor.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Free Hydroxy Groups for Enhanced Perfluorooctanoic Acid Uptake in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8210;organic frameworks bearing free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN&#8208;1001 and twofold interpenetrated PCN&#8208;1002, are reported. Compared to PCN&#8208;1001, PCN&#8208;1002 displays higher chemical stability, thereby exhibiting a remarkable perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) uptake (632&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1). Mechanism study reveals that multiple hydrogen bonds between free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites and PFOA and Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.








Abstract
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a highly recalcitrant organic pollutant, and its bioaccumulation severely endangers human health. While various methods are developed for PFOA removal, the targeted design of adsorbents with high efficiency and reusability remains largely unexplored. Here the rational design and synthesis of two novel zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs) bearing free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN&#8208;1001 and twofold interpenetrated PCN&#8208;1002,&#160;are presented. Single crystal analysis of the pure ligand reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a pivotal role in directing the formation of MOFs with free hydroxy groups. Furthermore, the transformation from PCN&#8208;1001 to PCN&#8208;1002 is realized. Compared to PCN&#8208;1001, PCN&#8208;1002 displays higher chemical stability due to interpenetration, thereby demonstrating an exceptional PFOA adsorption capacity of up to 632&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 (1.53&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1), which is comparable to the reported record values. Moreover, PCN&#8208;1002 shows rapid kinetics, high selectivity, and long&#8208;life cycles in PFOA removal tests. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance results and density functional theory calculations reveal that multiple hydrogen bonds between the free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites and PFOA, along with Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction, work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.

Compared to PCN-1001, PCN-1002 displays higher chemical stability, thereby exhibiting a remarkable perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) uptake (632&#160;mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Mechanism study reveals that multiple hydrogen bonds between free &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy sites and PFOA and Lewis acid-base interaction work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a highly recalcitrant organic pollutant, and its bioaccumulation severely endangers human health. While various methods are developed for PFOA removal, the targeted design of adsorbents with high efficiency and reusability remains largely unexplored. Here the rational design and synthesis of two novel zirconium-based metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs) bearing free &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN-1001 and twofold interpenetrated PCN-1002,&#160;are presented. Single crystal analysis of the pure ligand reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a pivotal role in directing the formation of MOFs with free hydroxy groups. Furthermore, the transformation from PCN-1001 to PCN-1002 is realized. Compared to PCN-1001, PCN-1002 displays higher chemical stability due to interpenetration, thereby demonstrating an exceptional PFOA adsorption capacity of up to 632&#160;mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1.53&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is comparable to the reported record values. Moreover, PCN-1002 shows rapid kinetics, high selectivity, and long-life cycles in PFOA removal tests. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance results and density functional theory calculations reveal that multiple hydrogen bonds between the free &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy sites and PFOA, along with Lewis acid-base interaction, work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracing Immunological Interaction in Trimethylamine N&#8208;Oxide Hydrogel&#8208;Derived Zwitterionic Microenvironment During Promoted Diabetic Wound Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a zwitterionic hydrogel for promoted diabetic wound healing by modulating multicellular heterogeneity and interaction of immune cells. This work finds that the zwitterionic hydrogel up&#8208;regulates Ccl3+ macrophages and down&#8208;regulates S100a9+ neutrophils; moreover, it suppresses NETs formation and boosts angiogenesis, thereby enhancing diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
The diabetic wound healing is challenging due to the sabotaged delicate balance of immune regulation via an undetermined pathophysiological mechanism, so it is crucial to decipher multicellular signatures underlying diabetic wound healing and seek therapeutic strategies. Here, this work develops a strategy using novel trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO)&#8208;derived zwitterionic hydrogel to promote diabetic wound healing, and explore the multi&#8208;cellular ecosystem around zwitterionic hydrogel, mapping out an overview of different cells in the zwitterionic microenvironment by single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing. The diverse cellular heterogeneity is revealed, highlighting the critical role of macrophage and neutrophils in managing diabetic wound healing. It is found that polyzwitterionic hydrogel can upregulate Ccl3+ macrophages and downregulate S100a9+ neutrophils and facilitate their interactions compared with polyanionic and polycationic hydrogels, validating the underlying effect of zwitterionic microenvironment on the activation of adaptive immune system. Moreover, zwitterionic hydrogel inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and promotes angiogenesis, thus improving diabetic wound healing. These findings expand the horizons of the sophisticated orchestration of immune systems in zwitterion&#8208;directed diabetic wound repair and uncover new strategies of novel immunoregulatory biomaterials.

         <title>Functional Covalent Organic Frameworks&#8217; Microspheres Synthesized by Self&#8208;Limited Dynamic Linker Exchange for Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphology&#8208;retain &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; strategy is developed to prepare uniform functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) microspheres by in situ linker exchange, in which six COF microspheres with different functional groups are constructed, showing the universality and superiority of the strategy. Further, the chiral functional COF microspheres are used as stationary phases of chiral chromatography and realized effective enantioseparation.








Abstract
Synthesizing uniform functional covalent organic framework (COF) microspheres is the prerequisite of applying COFs as novel stationary phases for liquid chromatography. However, the synthesis of functionalized COF microspheres is challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining microspheric morphology when conferring functions. Here, a facile and universal &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; strategy is developed to achieve surface functionalization of uniform COF microspheres. Six different types of COF microspheres are constructed, showing the universality and superiority of the strategy. The library of COF microspheres&#8217; stationary phases can be further enriched on demand by varying different functional building blocks. The &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; is attributed to the result of a delicate balance of reaction thermodynamics and molecular diffusion energy barrier. As a demonstration, the chiral functional COF microspheres are used as stationary phases of chiral chromatography and realized effective enantioseparation.

         <title>Turning Waste into Wealth: A Potent Sono&#8208;Immune Strategy Based on Microcystis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon US exposure, natural sonosensitizer Microcystis elabens (Me)generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and releases debris to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation via the Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) pathway to activate anti&#8208;cancer immunity. After combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the therapeutic outcomes of the Me&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;immune strategy are potentiated with improved metastatic inhibition.








Abstract
Currently, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has limited therapeutic outcomes and immune responses, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced strategies that can stimulate robust and long&#8208;lasting antitumor effects. Microcystis, a notorious microalga, reveals the possibility of mediating SDT owing to the presence of gas vesicles (GVs) and phycocyanin (PC). Herein, a nontoxic strain of Microcystis elabens (labeled Me) is developed as a novel agent for SDT because it generates O2 under red light (RL) illumination, while GVs and PC act as cavitation nuclei and sonosensitizers, respectively. Moreover, algal debris is released after ultrasound (US) irradiation, which primes the Toll&#8208;like receptor pathway to initiate a cascade of immune responses. This sono&#8208;immune strategy inhibits CT26 colon tumor growth largely by promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell activation. After combination with the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the therapeutic outcome is further amplified, accompanied by satisfactory abscopal and immune memory effects; the similar potency is proven in the &#8220;cold&#8221; 4T1 triple&#8208;negative breast tumor. In addition, Me exhibits good biosafety without significant acute or chronic toxicity. Briefly, this study turns waste into wealth by introducing sono&#8208;immunotherapy based on Microcystis that achieved encouraging therapeutic effects on cancer, which is expected to be translated into the clinic.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Earth&#8208;Abundant Cathodes with Enhanced Cationic/Anionic Redox for Sustainable and Long&#8208;Lasting Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and earth&#8208;abundant Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.5Mg0.1Ti0.1O2 cathode is developed, which shows significantly improved cycling stability at a high charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V versus Na. Multiscale characterization reveals that the Mg/Ti co&#8208;doping improves the surface and bulk structural stability and enhances the cationic and anionic redox reaction reversibility during prolong cycling.








Abstract
Layered iron/manganese&#8208;based oxides are a class of promising cathode materials for sustainable batteries due to their high energy densities and earth abundance. However, the stabilization of cationic and anionic redox reactions in these cathodes during cycling at high voltage remain elusive. Here, an electrochemically/thermally stable P2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.5Mg0.1Ti0.1O2 cathode material with zero critical elements is designed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) to realize a highly reversible capacity of &#8776;210&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 300 cycles at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, even when operated with a high charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V versus sodium metal. Combining a suite of cutting&#8208;edge characterizations and computational modeling, it is shown that Mg/Ti co&#8208;doping leads to stabilized surface/bulk structure at high voltage and high temperature, and more importantly, enhances cationic/anionic redox reaction reversibility over extended cycles with the suppression of other undesired oxygen activities. This work fundamentally deepens the failure mechanism of Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered cathodes and highlights the importance of dopant engineering to achieve high&#8208;energy and earth&#8208;abundant cathode material for sustainable and long&#8208;lasting NIBs.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Aligned All&#8208;Fiber Actuator with Asymmetric Photothermal&#8208;Humidity Response and Autonomous Perceptivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric highly aligned all&#8208;fiber membrane (HAFM) is created, exhibiting a hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structure and excellent mechanical toughness. It shows dual&#8208;directional thermal&#8208;induced moisture&#8208;responsive actuation with huge bending curvature (&#8764;7.23 cm&#8722;1) and fast response (0.60 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Integrating the actuation&#8208;triggered triboelectric effect, programmable micromanipulators, walking robots with self&#8208;powered perceptivity, and plant robots with autonomous environment interactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
Soft robots adapt to complex environments for autonomous locomotion, manipulation, and perception are attractive for robot&#8208;environment interactions. Strategies to reconcile environment&#8208;triggered actuation and self&#8208;powered sensing responses to different stimuli remain challenging. By tuning the in situ vapor phase solvent exchange effect in continuous electrospinning, an asymmetric highly&#8208;aligned all&#8208;fiber membrane (HAFM) with a hierarchical &#8220;grape&#8208;like&#8221; nanosphere&#8208;assembled microfiber structure (specific surface area of 13.6&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent mechanical toughness (tensile stress of 5.5&#160;MPa, and fracture toughness of 798&#160;KJ&#160;m&#8722;3) is developed, which shows efficient asymmetric actuation to both photothermal and humidity stimuli. The HAFM consists of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;enhanced moisture&#8208;responsive layer and an MXene&#8208;improved photothermal&#8208;responsive layer, which achieves substantial actuation with a bending curvature up to &#8776;7.23&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a fast response of 0.60&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. By tailoring the fiber alignment and bi&#8208;layer thickness ratio, different types of micromanipulators, automatic walking robots, and plant robots with programmable structures are demonstrated, which are realized for self&#8208;powered information perception of material type, object moisture, and temperature by integrating the autonomous triboelectric effect induced by photothermal&#8208;moisture actuation. This work presents fiber materials with programable hierarchical asymmetries and inspires a common strategy for self&#8208;powered organism&#8208;interface robots to interact with complex environments.

         <title>Highly Horizontal Oriented Tricomponent Exciplex Host with Multiple Reverse Intersystem Crossing Channels for High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Electroluminescence and Eye&#8208;Protection White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly horizontal&#8208;oriented tricomponent exciplex with multiple reverse intersystem crossing channels is developed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced up&#8208;conversion of non&#8208;radiative triplet excitons, which enables simultaneous high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off narrowband electroluminescence and eye&#8208;protection illumination.








Abstract
Despite multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with small full&#8208;width at half maximum are attractive for wide color&#8208;gamut display and eye&#8208;protection lighting applications, their inefficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and long exciton lifetime induce serious efficiency roll&#8208;off, which significantly limits their development. Herein, a novel device concept of building highly efficient tricomponent exciplex with multiple RISC channels is proposed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced upconversion of nonradiative triplet excitons, and subsequently used as a host for high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Compared with traditional binary exciplex, the tricomponent exciplex exhibits obviously improved photoluminescence quantum yield, emitting dipole orientation and RISC rate constant, and a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.4% is achieved for tricomponent exciplex p&#8208;PhBCzPh: PO&#8208;T2T: DspiroAc&#8208;TRZ (50: 20: 30) based OLED. Remarkably, maximum EQEs of 36.2% and 40.3% and ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 26.1% and 30.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are respectively achieved for its sky&#8208;blue and pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF doped OLEDs. Additionally, the blue emission unit hosted by tricomponent exciplex is combined with an orange&#8208;red TADF emission unit to achieve a double&#8208;emission&#8208;layer blue&#8208;hazard&#8208;free warm white OLED with an EQEmax of 30.3% and stable electroluminescence spectra over a wide brightness range.

         <title>Ultrafast dynamics of Bloch surface wave polaritons in large&#8208;area 2D semiconductor monolayers at room temperature</title>

Abstract
The dynamics of strongly coupled polariton systems integrated with two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is key to enabling efficient coherent processes and achieving high&#8208;performance TMD&#8208;based polaritonic devices such as ultralow&#8208;threshold polariton lasers and ultrafast optical switches. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the excited state dynamics in TMD&#8208;based polariton systems. In this work, we use ultrafast pump&#8208;probe optical spectroscopy to investigate the room&#8208;temperature dynamics of the polariton systems consisting of TMD monolayer excitons strongly coupled with Bloch surface waves (BSWs) supported by all&#8208;dielectric photonic structures. The transient response is found for both above&#8208;exciton energy pumping and polariton&#8208;resonant pumping. We observe the excited state population and ultrafast coherent coupling of the exciton reservoir and lower polariton (LP) branch for resonant pumping. Moreover, it is found that transient response of the LP first decays on a short time scale of 0.15&#8208;0.25&#160;ps compared to the calculated intrinsic lifetime of 0.11&#8208;0.20&#160;ps, and is followed by longer decay (&gt; 100&#160;ps) due to the dynamical evolution of the exciton reservoir. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the dynamics in TMD&#8208;based polariton systems while showing the potential for achieving efficient coherent optical processes for device applications.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Reactivity of Conjugated Microporous Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Particle size is a critical factor for improving photocatalytic reactivity of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) as mass transfer in the porous materials is often the rate&#8208;limiting step. However, due to the synthetic challenge of controlling the size of CMPs, while ensuring good dispersibility, the impact of particle size has yet to be investigated. To address this problem, we propose a simple and versatile dispersion polymerization route that can synthesize dispersible CMP nanoparticles with controlled size from 15&#160;nm to 180&#160;nm. Leveraging the precise control of the size, we demonstrate that smaller CMP nanoparticles have dramatically higher photocatalytic reactivity in various organic transformations, achieving more than 1000% enhancement in the reaction rates by decreasing the size from 180&#160;nm to 15&#160;nm. The size&#8208;dependent photocatalytic reactivity is further scrutinized using a kinetic model and transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing that only the initial 5&#160;nm&#8208;thick surface layer of CMP nanoparticles is involved in the photocatalytic reactions because of internal mass transfer limitations. This finding substantiates the potential of small CMP nanoparticles to efficiently use photo&#8208;generated excitons and improve energy&#8208;efficiency of numerous photocatalytic reactions.

Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern&#160;optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in&#160;digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single device platform are&#160;in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. We report an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electrons that can be modulated to control electron separation, collection, and storage process in the channel of the fabricated phototransistor. As a result, when exposed to different light sources, the device shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics owing to the successful programming of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100 A/W and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8764;108&#160;A/W were achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#215;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage capability. Demonstrating three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

We report an AlGaN/GaN-based double-heterostructure, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization-induced two-dimensional electrons that can be modulated to control electron separation, collection, and storage process in the channel of the fabricated phototransistor. As a result, when exposed to different light sources, the device shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics owing to the successful programming of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs. A self-powered mode with a responsivity over 100 A/W and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A/W were achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#215;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage capability. Demonstrating three-in-one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Microporous Materials in Polymer Electrolytes: The Merit of Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) have garnered significant attention in the critical field of sustainable energy storage due to their potential benefits in safety, energy density, and cycle life. The large&#8208;scale, cost&#8208;effective production of SSBs necessitates the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes. However, the manufacturing of SSBs relies heavily on the advancement of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs), which combine the advantages of ordered microporous materials (OMMs) and polymer electrolytes, meet the requirements for high ionic conductivity/transference number, stability with respect to electrodes, compatibility with established manufacturing processes, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them particularly well&#8208;suited for mass production of SSBs. This review delineates how structural ordering dictates the fundamental physicochemical properties of OMMs, including ion transport, thermal transfer, and mechanical stability. We critically examine the applications of prominent OMMs, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and zeolites, in CPEs, highlighting how structural ordering facilitates the fulfillment of property requirements. Finally, we provide an outlook on the field, exploring how the properties of CPEs can be enhanced through the dimensional design of OMMs, and underscore the importance of uncovering the underlying &#8220;feature&#8208;function&#8221; mechanisms of various CPE types.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalates and Porphyrins as Anode for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been considered as one of the most promising anode candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in virtue of their high theoretical capacity and reversible multielectron redox properties. However, the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in organic electrolytes hinder their widespread applications in LIBs. Herein, a novel hybrid nanomaterial is synthesized by co&#8208;assembling POMs and porphyrins (PMo12/CoTPyP) through a facile solvothermal method. The POMs clusters are stabilized by porphyrin units through electrostatic interactions, which simultaneously realizes the uniform dispersion of POMs and porphyrin units. Benefiting from the generated sub&#8208;1&#160;nm channels for fast ion transport and the synergistic effect between evenly distributed PMo12 clusters and high&#8208;conductive CoTPyP units, the LIB based on the optimized PMo12/CoTPyP anode exhibits significant improved Li+ storage capability as well as superior rate and cycling performance. The results of density functional theory (DFT) simulations further reveal that the co&#8208;assembly of PMo12 and CoTPyP can accelerate the mobility of Li+ and electrons, which in turn promotes the enhancement of LIBs performance. This work paves a strategy for synthesizing POMs&#8211;based anode materials with simultaneously high dispersibility, redox activity and stability.

         <title>Towards Functionality and Deactivation of Metal&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom in Heterogeneous Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) provide an enticing platform for understanding catalyst structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships. The 100% atom utilization and adjustable local coordination configurations make it easy to probe reaction mechanisms at the atomic level. However, the progressive deactivation of metal&#8208;single&#8208;atom (MSA) with high surface energy leads to frequent limitations on their commercial viability. In this review, we focus on the atomistic&#8208;sensitive reactivity and atomistic&#8208;progressive deactivation of MSA to provide a unifying framework for specific functionality and potential deactivation drivers of MSA, thereby bridging function, purpose&#8208;modification structure&#8208;performance insights with the atomistic&#8208;progressive deactivation for sustainable structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance accessibility. We first systematically explore the dominant functionalization of atomically precise MSA acting on properties and reactivity encompassing precise photocatalytic reactions. Afterwards, a detailed analysis of various deactivation modes of MSA and strategies to enhance their durability are presented, providing valuable insights into the design of SAHCs with deactivation&#8208;resistant stability. Finally, we complete with a look into the remaining challenges and future perspectives of SAHCs towards industrialization, anticipating shedding some light on the next stage of atom&#8208;economic chemical/energy transformations.

         <title>Highly Reversible Tin Film Anode Guided via Interfacial Coordination Effect for High Energy Aqueous Acidic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sn metal is a preferable choice as anode material for aqueous acidic batteries due to its acid&#8208;tolerance, non&#8208;toxicity, and ease of recycling. However, the large size and irregular deposition morphology of polyhedral Sn particles are bad for constructing stable and high&#8208;capacity Sn metal anode because of severe hydrogen evolution and metal shedding. To tackle this critical issue, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;octylphenol pentaethoxylate (POPE) is used as an electrolyte additive to generate thin&#8208;film Sn anode with reversible stripping/plating behavior. POPE can not only induce homogeneous surface chemistry by adsorbing on the Sn surface via coordination bonds, but also inhibit hydrogen evolution through modulating the solvation shell of Sn2+. The Sn film anode delivers improved electrochemical stability over 480&#160;h with satisfactory rate performance and low polarization. Moreover, the as&#8208;assembled PbO2//Sn battery could also provide outstanding durability at 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work offers new inspiration for developing reversible Sn metal film anode.

         <title>Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Molecular&#8208;Intercalated Antiferromagnet VOCl</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets are gaining attention in fundamental physics and advanced spintronics, due to their unique dimension&#8208;dependent magnetism and potential for ultra&#8208;compact integration. However, achieving intrinsic ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature (TC) remains a technical challenge, including preparation and stability issues. Herein, we develop an applicable electrochemical intercalation strategy to decouple interlayer interaction and guide charge doping in antiferromagnet VOCl, thereby inducing robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. The expanded vdW gap isolates the neighboring layers and shrinks the distance between the V&#8208;V bond, favoring the generation of ferromagnetic (FM) coupling with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Element&#8208;specific X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) directly proves the source of the ferromagnetism. Detailed experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the charge doping enhances the FM interaction by promoting the orbital hybridization between t2g and eg. Our work sheds new light on a promising way to achieve room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in antiferromagnets, thus addressing the critical materials demand for designing spintronic devices.

Abstract
The quest for artificial light sources that mimic sunlight's spectral characteristics has been a long&#8208;standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators, such as xenon lamps, are often cost&#8208;prohibitive and bulky, limiting their adoption. In this regard, the development of a series of single&#8208;phase phosphors Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:0.1Eu2+ (x = 0&#8208;0.75) with sunlight&#8208;like emission described in this work holds immense promise as a compact and economical light source alternative. The phosphors have been obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum that encompasses the entire visible region, spanning from violet to deep red. Notably, the phosphor with x = 0.5 exhibits an impressive full width at half maximum of 330&#160;nm. A synergistic interplay of experimental investigations and density&#8208;functional theory calculations unveils the underlying mechanism behind sunlight&#8208;like emission. It is attributed to the local structural perturbations introduced by the heterovalent substitution of Al3+ for Mg2+, leading to a varied distribution of Eu2+ within the lattice. Subsequent characterization of a series of organic dyes combining absorption spectroscopy with convolutional neural network analysis convincingly demonstrates the potential of this phosphor in portable photodetection devices. Broad&#8208;spectrum light source testing empowers our model to precisely differentiate dye patterns. This points to the phosphor being ideal for mimicking sunlight. And beyond this demonstrated application, we envision the phosphor's utility in other relevant domains, including visible light communication and smart agriculture. These findings not only enrich our understanding of luminescent materials design but also pave the way for advancements in various application areas.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change colour in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy efficient windows being one of primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) were observed. The transition temperature was tunable from 11 to 61 &#870; C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement was observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for CO2 Reduction and O2 Evolution: A Pivotal for Aqueous Rechargeable Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quest for the advancement of green energy storage technologies and reduction of carbon footprint is determinedly rising towards carbon neutrality. Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries (ARZCBs) hold the great potential to encounter both the targets simultaneously, i.e., green energy storage &amp; CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels. The major descriptor of ARZCBs efficiency is allied with the reactions occurring at cathode during discharging (CO2 reduction) and charging (O2 evolution) which own different fundamental mechanisms and hence mandate the employment of two different catalysts. This presents an overall complex and expensive battery system which requires a concrete solution, while the development and application of a bifunctional cathode catalyst towards both reactions could reduce the complexity and cost and thus can be a pivotal for ARZCBs. However, despite the increasing research interest and ongoing research, a systematic evaluation of bifunctional catalysts is rarely reported. In this review, the need of bifunctional cathode catalysts for ARZCBs and associated challenges with strategies have been critically assessed. A detailed progress examination and understanding towards designing of bifunctional catalyst for ARZCBs have been provided. This review will enlighten the future research approaching boosted performance of ARZCBs through the development of efficient bifunctional cathode catalysts.

         <title>Reviving Fatigue Surface for Solid&#8208;State Upcycling of Highly Degraded Polycrystalline LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 Cathodes</title>

Abstract
The ongoing tide of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries urgently calls for high&#8208;value output in efficient recycling. Recently, direct regeneration is emerged as a novel recycling strategy but fails to repair the irreversible morphology and structure damages of the highly degraded polycrystalline layered oxide materials. Here, we carry out a solid&#8208;state upcycling study for the severely cracked LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 cathodes. The specific single&#8208;crystallization process during calcination is investigated and the surface rock salt phase is recognized as the intrinsic obstacle to the crystal growth of the degraded cathodes due to sluggish diffusion in the heterogeneous grain boundary. Accordingly, we revive the fatigue rock salt phase by restoring a layered surface and successfully reshape severely broken cathodes into the high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystalline particles. Benefiting from morphological and structural integrity, the upcycled single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials exhibit an enhanced capacity retention rate of 93.5% after 150 cycles at 1C compared with 61.7% of the regenerated polycrystalline materials. The performance is also beyond that of the commercial cathodes even under a high cut&#8208;off voltage (4.5&#160;V) or high operating temperature (45 &#176;C). This work provides scientific insights for the upcycling of the highly degraded cathodes in spent LIBs.

         <title>High Lactate&#8208;Metabolizing Photosynthetic Bacteria Reprogram Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) has been considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. In this work, we selectively screen a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening was initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of anti&#8208;tumor immune therapy. Our approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Enhanced Acoustical Performance for Efficient Mechano&#8208;Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;doped zinc oxide nanoparticle is constructed for enhanced acoustically triggered mechano&#8208;sonodynamic therapy. The introduction of carbon (C) element improves the inherent acoustic properties of the nanoparticles, intensifying their generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cavitation effect under ultrasound (US) irradiation, thereby exhibiting potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US) generates toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by acting on sonosensitizers for cancer treatment, and the mechanical damage induced by cavitation effects under US is equally significant. Therefore, designing a novel sonosensitizer that simultaneously possesses efficient ROS generation and enhanced mechanical effects is promising. In this study, carbon&#8208;doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (C&#8208;ZnO) are constructed for mechano&#8208;sonodynamic cancer therapy. The presence of carbon (C) doping optimizes the electronic structure, thereby enhancing the ROS generation triggered by US, efficiently inducing tumor cell death. On the other hand, the high specific surface area and porous structure brought about by C doping enable C&#8208;ZnO to enhance the mechanical stress induced by cavitation bubbles under US irradiation, causing severe mechanical damage to tumor cells. Under the dual effects of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and mechanical therapy mediated by C&#8208;ZnO, excellent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, along with a high level of biological safety. This is the first instance of utilizing an inorganic nanomaterial to achieve simultaneous enhancement of ROS production and US&#8208;induced mechanical effects for cancer therapy. This holds significant importance for the future development of novel sonosensitizers and advancing the applications of US in cancer treatment.

This is the first instance of utilizing an inorganic nanomaterial to achieve simultaneous enhancement of ROS production and US-induced mechanical effects for cancer therapy. This holds significant importance for the future development of novel sonosensitizers and advancing the applications of US in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitric Oxide&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Codelivery Nanoassembly for In Situ Synthesis of Photothermal Agent for Precise and Safe Anticancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal codelivery nanosystem (TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg) is composed of a precursor (TTB&#8208;NH2) and amphipathic polyarginine (PArg). PArg serves as a self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier for TTB&#8208;NH2 and also a NO generator. In tumor microenvironment, high H2O2 concentration triggers sustainable NO generation, which converts TTB&#8208;NH2 into a photothermal agent TTB&#8208;AZO for precise and safe anticancer treatment.








Abstract
The development of bioorthogonal activation in drug release represents a promising avenue for precise and safe anticancer treatment. However, two significant limitations currently hinder their clinical application: i) the necessity for separate administration of the drug precursor and its corresponding activator, leading to poor drug accumulation and potential side effects; ii) the reliance on exogenous metal or organic activators for triggering bioorthogonal activation, which often exhibit low efficiency and systemic toxicity when extending to living animals. To overcome these limitations, a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal codelivery nanoassembly, termed TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, which comprises a precursor molecular (TTB&#8208;NH2) and amphipathic polyarginine (PArg) is developed. In TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, PArg serves as both self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier for TTB&#8208;NH2 and a NO generator. In tumor microenvironment (TME), the TME&#8208;specific generation of NO acts as a gas activator, triggering in situ bioorthogonal bond formation that transforms TTB&#8208;NH2 into TTB&#8208;AZO. This tumor&#8208;specific generation of TTB&#8208;AZO not only serves as a potential photothermal agent for effective tumor inhibition but also induces fluorescence change that enables real&#8208;time monitoring of bioorthogonal activation. This study presents a drug codelivery approach that enables precise and safe control of bioorthogonal activation for anticancer treatment, improving cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects.

         <title>Digitization of Colorimetric Sensor Technologies for Food Safety</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colorimetric sensors play a crucial role in promoting on&#8208;site testing, enabling the detection and/or quantification of various analytes based on changes in colour. These sensors offer several advantages, such as simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and visual readouts, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including food safety and monitoring. A critical component in portable colorimetric sensors involves their integration with colour models for effective analysis and interpretation of output signals. The most commonly used models include CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). This review outlines the use of colour models via digitalisation in sensing applications within the food safety and monitoring field. Additionally, challenges, future directions, and considerations are discussed, highlighting a significant gap in integrating a comparative analysis towards determining the colour model that results in the highest sensor performance. The aim of this review is to underline the potential of this integration in mitigating the global impact of food spoilage and contamination on health and the economy, proposing a multidisciplinary approach to harness the full capabilities of colorimetric sensors in ensuring food safety.

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Zinc Deposition: A Guide Factor for Designing Durable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new indicator (fD) is proposed to specifically evaluate dendrite growth. As proof of concept, triethylenetetramine, as an electrolyte additive, featured uniform zinc deposition and a corroborating low fD factor. Demonstrated zinc electrodes sustain over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 400&#160;h at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;term cycling in Zn||MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Zinc metal is recognized as the most promising anode for aqueous energy storage but suffers from severe dendrite growth and poor reversibility. However, the coulombic efficiency lacks specificity for zinc dendrite growth, particularly in Zn||Zn symmetric cells. Herein, a novel indicator (fD) based on the characteristic crystallization peaks is proposed to evaluate the growth and distribution of zinc dendrites. As a proof of concept, triethylenetetramine (TETA) is adopted as an electrolyte additive to manipulate the zinc flux for uniform deposition, with a corroborating low fD value. A highly durable zinc symmetric cell is achieved, lasting over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 400&#160;h at a large discharge of depth (10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Supported by the low fD value, the Zn||TETA&#8208;ZnSO4||MnO2 batteries overcome the sudden short circuit and fast capacity fading. The study provides a feasible method to evaluate zinc dendrites and sheds light on the design of highly reversible zinc anodes.

         <title>Photochromic Carbon Nanomaterials: An Emerging Class of Light&#8208;Driven Hybrid Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When carbon nanomaterials are functionalized by photochromic molecules, the resultant hybrids exhibit either new or improved properties and functions that are attractive for diverse device applications. This review summarizes the fabrication methods, properties, and various applications of photochromic carbon nanomaterials.








Abstract
Photochromic molecules have remarkable potential in memory and optical devices, as well as in driving and manipulating molecular motors or actuators and many other systems using light. When photochromic molecules are introduced into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), the resulting hybrids provide unique advantages and create new functions that can be employed in specific applications and devices. This review highlights the recent developments in diverse photochromic CNMs. Photochromic molecules and CNMs are also introduced. The fundamentals of different photochromic CNMs are discussed, including design principles and the types of interactions between CNMs and photochromic molecules via covalent interactions and non&#8208;covalent bonding such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, amphiphilic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. Then the properties of photochromic CNMs, e.g., in photopatterning, fluorescence modulation, actuation, and photoinduced surface&#8208;relief gratings, and their applications in energy storage (solar thermal fuels, photothermal batteries, and supercapacitors), nanoelectronics (transistors, molecular junctions, photo&#8208;switchable conductance, and photoinduced electron transfer), sensors, and bioimaging are highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges and opportunities in the future of photochromic CNMs is presented. This review discusses a vibrant interdisciplinary research field and is expected to stimulate further developments in nanoscience, advanced nanotechnology, intelligently responsive materials, and devices.

         <title>Fabrication of Isotope&#8208;Enriched Nanostructures Using Ultrafast Laser Pulses under Ambient Conditions for Biomolecular Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is a novel approach that revolutionizes lab&#8208;scale synthesis of stable isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures using high&#8208;intensity laser pulses. Achieving a remarkable 5000&#8208;fold isotope enrichment in light atomic mass elements, LIIEN produces nanostructures that deliver exceptional SERS (Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering) signal enhancement, making them ideal for advanced biomolecule sensing.








Abstract
Recent advances in the use of stable isotopes necessitate novel synthesis techniques for isotope separation and enrichment that are scalable and offer high throughput. Stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures can offer unique advantages as nanomedicines, safe tracers, and labels and are critical for applications in various industrial processes, metabolic research, and medicine. So far, there exists no method to synthesize miniature isotope&#8208;enriched materials at the nanoscale. In this study, an ultrafast Laser&#8208;induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is put forward to synthesize isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures, eliminating the need for large equipment and expenses, thereby demonstrating a lab&#8208;scale isotope enrichment process.

     alt="Fabrication of Isotope-Enriched Nanostructures Using Ultrafast Laser Pulses under Ambient Conditions for Biomolecular Sensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laser-induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is a novel approach that revolutionizes lab-scale synthesis of stable isotope-enriched nanostructures using high-intensity laser pulses. Achieving a remarkable 5000-fold isotope enrichment in light atomic mass elements, LIIEN produces nanostructures that deliver exceptional SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) signal enhancement, making them ideal for advanced biomolecule sensing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in the use of stable isotopes necessitate novel synthesis techniques for isotope separation and enrichment that are scalable and offer high throughput. Stable-isotope-enriched nanostructures can offer unique advantages as nanomedicines, safe tracers, and labels and are critical for applications in various industrial processes, metabolic research, and medicine. So far, there exists no method to synthesize miniature isotope-enriched materials at the nanoscale. In this study, an ultrafast Laser-induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is put forward to synthesize isotope-enriched nanostructures, eliminating the need for large equipment and expenses, thereby demonstrating a lab-scale isotope enrichment process. A significant isotope enrichment for Carbon nanostructures is observed. The isotope enrichment can be attributed to the redistribution of isotope ions in the plasma plume explained by the plasma centrifuge model. The LIIEN synthesized structures exhibit excellent Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#160;signal enhancement and reproducibility, making them potential candidates for SERS-based biomolecule sensing. This technique is an efficient method to fabricate nanosized isotope-enriched structures of characteristic properties by carefully tuning laser parameters at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phonon Engineering in Solid Polymer Electrolyte toward High Safety for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the influence of phonon scattering on solid&#8208;state&#8208;polymer electrolytes (SPEs), and designs an ultrathin PPIL electrolyte with high thermal stability by phonon engineering to optimize the high&#8208;safety of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). Herein, a new way to enable SSLBs with high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density is shown, and the importance of phonon engineering in high&#8208;safety of SSLBs is highlighted.








Abstract
Extensively&#8208;used rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) face challenges in achieving high safety and long cycle life. To address such challenges, ultrathin solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is fabricated with reduced phonon scattering by depositing the composites of ionic&#8208;liquid (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium dicyamide, EMIM:DCA), polyurethane (PU) and lithium salt on the polyethylene separator. The robust and flexible separator matrix not only reduces the electrolyte thickness and improves the mobility of Li+, but more importantly provides a relatively regular thermal diffusion channel for SPE and reduces the external phonon scattering. Moreover, the introduction of EMIM:DCA successfully breaks the random intermolecular attraction of the PU polymer chain and significantly decreases phonon scattering to enhance the internal thermal conductivity of the polymer. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the as&#8208;obtained SPE increases by approximately six times, and the thermal runaway (TR) of the battery is effectively inhibited. This work demonstrates that optimizing thermal safety of the battery by phonon engineering sheds a new light on the design principle for high&#8208;safety Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Engineered Probiotic Bio&#8208;heterojunction with Robust Antibiofilm Modality via &#8220;Eating&#8221; Extracellular Polymeric Substances for Wound Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The compact three&#8208;dimensional structure of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) within biofilms significantly hinders the penetration of antimicrobial agents, making biofilm eradication challenging and resulting in persistent biofilm&#8208;associated infections. To address this challenge, we propose a solution: a probiotic bio&#8208;heterojunction (P&#8208;bioHJ) combining Lactobacillus rhamnosus with MXene (Ti3C2) quantum dots (MQDs)/FeS heterojunction. This innovation aims to break down the saccharides in EPS, enabling effective combat against biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Initially, the P&#8208;bioHJ targets saccharides through metabolic processes, causing the collapse of EPS and allowing infiltration into bacterial colonies. Simultaneously, upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the P&#8208;bioHJ produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thermal energy, deploying physical mechanisms to combat bacterial biofilms effectively. Following antibiofilm treatment, the P&#8208;bioHJ adjusts the oxidative environment, reduces wound inflammation by scavenging ROS, boosts antioxidant enzyme activity, and mitigates the NF&#8208;&#954;B inflammatory pathway, thereby accelerating wound healing. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm the exceptional antibiofilm, antioxidant/anti&#8208;inflammatory, and wound&#8208;regeneration properties of P&#8208;bioHJ. In conclusion, this study provides a promising approach for treating biofilm&#8208;related infections.

         <title>Unlocking Efficiency: Minimizing Energy Loss in Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Targeting, Multi&#8208;Faceted Biocompatible Nanodrug Optimizes the Microenvironment to Ameliorate Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</title>

Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a highly lethal cardiovascular disease that currently lacks effective pharmacological treatment given the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Here, we analyzed single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;sequencing data from patients with AAA and a mouse model, which revealed pivotal pathological changes, including the M1&#8208;like polarization of macrophages and the loss of contractile function in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Both cell types express the integrin &#945;v&#946;3, allowing for their dual targeting with a single rationally designed molecule. To this end, we designed a biocompatible nanodrug, which we term EVMS@R&#8208;HNC, that consists of the multifunctional drug everolimus (EVMS) encapsulated by the hepatitis B virus core protein modified to contain the RGD sequence to specifically bind to integrin &#945;v&#946;3. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that EVMS@R&#8208;HNC can target macrophages as well as SMCs. Upon binding of the nanodrug, the EVMS is released intracellularly where it exhibits multiple functions, including inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization, thereby suppressing the self&#8208;propagating inflammatory cascade and immune microenvironment imbalance, while preserving the normal contractile function of SMCs. Collectively, these results suggest that EVMS@R&#8208;HNC presents a highly promising therapeutic approach for the management of AAA.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Nanocarriers for Pharmacotherapy: Insights into Intracellular Dynamics at The Single Particle Level</title>

Abstract
Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (nanoMOFs) are widely implemented in a host of assays involving drug delivery, biosensing catalysis, and bioimaging. However, the cell pathways and cell fate remain poorly understood. Here, we have synthesized a new fluorescent nanoMOF integrating ATTO 655 into surface defects of colloidal UiO&#8208;66, allowing us to track the spatiotemporal localization of Single nanoMOF in live cells. DFT reveals the stronger binding of ATTO 655 to the Zr6 cluster nodes compared with phosphate and Alendronate Sodium. Parallelized tracking of the spatiotemporal localization of thousands of nanoMOFs and analysis using machine learning platforms revealed whether nanoMOFs remain outside as well as their cellular internalization pathways. To quantitatively assess their colocalization with endo/lysosomal compartments, we developed a colocalization proxy approach relying on the nanoMOF detection of particles in one channel to the signal in the corresponding endo/lysosomal compartments channel, considering signal versus local background intensity ratio and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This strategy mitigates colocalization value inflation from high or low signal expression in endo/lysosomal compartments. The results accurately measure the nanoMOFs&#8217; colocalization from early to late endosomes and lysosomes and emphasize the importance of understanding their intracellular dynamics based on single&#8208;particle tracking for optimal and safe drug delivery.

         <title>Robust Transient Semi&#8208;Glue Tape: Ultrastrong Adhesion Empowered by Water Activation and Self&#8208;Locking</title>

Abstract
In adhesive industry, tapes are renowned for their superior flexibility, repeatability, and ease of storage compared to glues. However, conventional adhesive tapes often suffer from low adhesion strength (&lt;&#160;500&#160;kPa). In this work, we introduce an innovative adhesive tape composed of an amphiphilic copolymer and a hydrophobic ionic liquid, achieving an ultrahigh adhesion strength of up to 3.1&#160;MPa on various substrates, making a record&#8208;high strength to date for tape&#8208;type adhesives. This exceptional adhesion performance is facilitated by water droplets applied at the bonding interface, transforming the adhesive surface into a glue&#8208;like property without the need for curing treatments or additional auxiliary equipment. By combining the advantageous features of both glues and tapes, these adhesives are termed as transient semi&#8208;glue tapes (TSGT). The mechanism behind such water activation and self&#8208;locking process is elucidated, and a general preparation approach is developed. Furthermore, the repeatability and recyclability of TSGT are demonstrated, offering an ingenious solution to this long&#8208;standing engineering challenge.

         <title>Chirality Induced Memristor of Chiral Nanostructured Half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spintronic memristors, which combine the nonvolatile characteristics of memristors with the scalability of a spin&#8208;transfer torque device, are expected to play a crucial role in advancing quantitative information processing. This field commonly relies on magnetic tunnel junctions, domain wall motion, and spin waves. Here, we report the discovery of chirality&#8208;induced memristor behavior in chiral nanostructured Fe3O4 films (CNFFs). These CNFFs were grown on fluorine tin oxide (FTO) substrates using enantiomeric glutamic acid (Glu) as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents and consist of arrays of oriented twisted nanofibers. At 100 K, the L&#8208;CNFF exhibits memristor behavior as a pinched hysteresis loop in the I&#8208;V curve, while the D&#8208;CNFF exhibits semiconductor behavior with constant electrical resistance. The intrinsic spin polarization of half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 and the chirality induced spin selectivity are speculated to contributed to the memristor in one handedness of the chiral structure. These findings present a novel spinristor that combines the functions of a memristor and a spin&#8208;filter based on chiral structures, which may promote the development of spintronic devices.

         <title>Strategy to Efficient Photodynamic Therapy for Antibacterium: Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While the construction of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure have gained great attention across various scientific disciplines, such structures have seldomly been reported within the field of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Herein, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) based HOF was synthesized, where the adjacent D&#8208;A pairs were connected by hydrogen bonds instead of the conventionally employed covalent bonds. This structural feature imparts material with a reduced energy gap between excited state and triplet state, thereby facilitating the intersystem crossing and boosting the generation rate of single oxygen (quantum yield = 0.98). Consequently, the resulting material showed high performance for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. The impact of D&#8208;A moiety was evident when comparing this finding to a parallel study conducted on an isoreticular HOF without a D&#8208;A structure. The study presented here provides in&#8208;depth insights into the photophysical properties of D&#8208;A pair in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network, opening a new avenue to design of innovative materials for efficient photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Surface Gradient Ni&#8208;rich Cathode for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode material LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). These cathode materials possess high theoretical specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer rate, and high output voltage. However, their potential has been impeded by interface instability, crystal irreversible phase transition, and the resultant significant capacity loss, limiting their practical application in LIBs. In this work, a simple and scalable approach is proposed to prepare gradient cathode material (M&#8208;NCM) with excellent structural stability and rate performance. Taking advantage of the strong coordination of Ni2+ with ammonia and the reduction reaction of KMnO4, the elemental compositions of the Ni&#8208;rich cathode were reasonably adjusted during the precursor preparation stage with surficial Ni depletion and Mn enrichment. In&#8208;depth investigations utilizing in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ technologies underscore that the gradient design of the components played a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure, which effectively mitigates Li/Ni mixing and suppresses unwanted parasitic reactions on the surface. As a result, our M&#8208;NCM cathode maintains a remarkable 98.6% capacity after 200 cycles, and a rapid charging ability of 107.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 C. Furthermore, a 1.2Ah pouch cell configurated with graphite anode demonstrates a lifespan of over 500 cycles with only 8% capacity loss. This work provides a simple and scalable approach for the in&#8208;situ construction of gradient cathode materials via cooperative coordination and deposition reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Nickel-rich layered oxide cathode material LiNi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM) has emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). These cathode materials possess high theoretical specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer rate, and high output voltage. However, their potential has been impeded by interface instability, crystal irreversible phase transition, and the resultant significant capacity loss, limiting their practical application in LIBs. In this work, a simple and scalable approach is proposed to prepare gradient cathode material (M-NCM) with excellent structural stability and rate performance. Taking advantage of the strong coordination of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with ammonia and the reduction reaction of KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the elemental compositions of the Ni-rich cathode were reasonably adjusted during the precursor preparation stage with surficial Ni depletion and Mn enrichment. In-depth investigations utilizing in-situ and ex-situ technologies underscore that the gradient design of the components played a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure, which effectively mitigates Li/Ni mixing and suppresses unwanted parasitic reactions on the surface. As a result, our M-NCM cathode maintains a remarkable 98.6% capacity after 200 cycles, and a rapid charging ability of 107.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 15 C. Furthermore, a 1.2Ah pouch cell configurated with graphite anode demonstrates a lifespan of over 500 cycles with only 8% capacity loss. This work provides a simple and scalable approach for the in-situ construction of gradient cathode materials via cooperative coordination and deposition reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Colloidal Quantum Dots: Progress and Opportunities in Solar Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise as building blocks in solar technologies owing to their remarkable photostability and adjustable properties through the rationale involving size, atomic composition of core and shell, shapes, and surface states. However, most high&#8208;performing QDs in solar conversion contain hazardous metal elements, including Cd and Pb, posing significant environmental risks. Here, we present a comprehensive review of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free colloidal QDs for solar technologies, including photovoltaic devices, solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical fuel conversion, and luminescent solar concentrators. We analyze emerging synthetic strategies to optimize the optical properties by tuning the energy band structure and manipulating charge dynamics within the QDs and at the QDs/charge acceptors interfaces. We also provide a comparative analysis of different synthetic methods, discuss structure&#8208;property relationships in these materials, and correlate them with the performance of solar devices. We conclude with an outlook on challenges and opportunities for future work, including machine learning&#8208;based design, sustainable synthesis, and new surface/interface engineering.

         <title>Over 19% Efficient Inverted Organic Photovoltaics Featuring a Molecularly Doped Metal Oxide Electron&#8208;Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Molecular doping is commonly utilised to tune the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors. However, applying this technique to dope inorganic materials like metal oxide semiconductors is challenging due to the limited availability of molecules with suitable energy levels and processing characteristics. Herein, n&#8208;type doping of ZnO films is demonstrated using 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (CO2&#8208;DMI), a thermally activated organic n&#8208;type dopant. Adding CO2&#8208;DMI into the ZnO precursor solution and processing it atop a pre&#8208;deposited InOx layer yielded InOx/n&#8208;ZnO heterojunctions with increased electron field&#8208;effect mobility of 32.6 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 compared to 18.5 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 for the pristine InOx/ZnO bilayer. The improved electron transport originates from the ZnO's enhanced crystallinity, reduced hydroxyl (OH) concentrations, and fewer oxygen vacancy groups upon doping. Applying the optimally doped InOx/n&#8208;ZnO heterojunctions as the electron&#8208;transporting layers (ETL) in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) yields cells with improved power conversion efficiency of 19.06%, up from 18.3% for devices with pristine ZnO 18.2% for devices featuring the undoped InOx/ZnO ETL. We show that the all&#8208;around improved OPV performance originates from synergistic effects associated with CO2&#8208;DMI doping of the thermally&#8208;grown ZnO, highlighting its potential as an electronic dopant for ZnO and potentially other metal oxides.

         <title>Piezoelectric Biomaterials Inspired by Nature for Applications in Biomedicine and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bioelectricity provides electrostimulation to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and functions. In the human body, bioelectricity can be generated in electromechanically responsive tissues and organs, as well as biomolecular building blocks that exhibit piezoelectricity, with a phenomenon known as the piezoelectric effect. Inspired by natural bio&#8208;piezoelectric phenomenon, efforts have been devoted to exploiting high&#8208;performance synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials, including molecular materials, polymeric materials, ceramic materials, and composite materials. Notably, piezoelectric biomaterials polarize under mechanical strain and generate electrical potentials, which can be used to fabricate electronic devices. Herein, we propose a review article to summarize the design and research progress of piezoelectric biomaterials and devices toward bionanotechnology. We first introduce the functions of bioelectricity in regulating human electrophysiological activity from cellular to tissue level. Next, recent advances as well as structure&#8208;property relationship of various natural and synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials are provided in detail. In the following part, we systematically classify and discuss the applications of piezoelectric biomaterials in tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensing, energy harvesting, and catalysis. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of piezoelectric biomaterials are presented. We believe that this review will provide inspiration for the design and development of innovative piezoelectric biomaterials in the fields of biomedicine and nanotechnology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in Advanced Membranes for Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osmotic energy, often referred to as &#8220;blue energy,&#8221; is the energy generated from the mixing of solutions with different salt concentrations, offering a vast, renewable, and environmentally friendly energy resource. Efficacy of osmotic power production considerably relies on the performance of the transmembrane process, which depends on ionic conductivity and the capability to differentiate between positive and negative ions. Recent advancements have led to the development of membrane materials featuring precisely tailored ion transport nanochannels, enabling high&#8208;efficiency osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, ion diffusion in confined nanochannels and the rational design and optimization of membrane architecture are explored. Furthermore, structural optimization of the membrane to mitigate transport resistance and the concentration polarization effect for enhancing osmotic energy harvesting is highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges that lie ahead is provided, and the potential applications of osmotic energy conversion are outlined. This review offers a comprehensive viewpoint on the evolving prospects of osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, we regulated the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component and restrained detrimental side reactions through the uniform loading of Na&#8208;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8208;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 hours with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

Heart transplantation offers life&#8208;saving treatment for patients with end&#8208;stage heart failure; however, ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) and subsequent immune responses remain significant challenges. Current therapies primarily target adaptive immunity, with limited options available for addressing IRI and innate immune activation. Although plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) show promise in managing diseases, their application in organ transplantation complications is unexplored. Here, this work develops a novel reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive multifunctional fusion extracellular nanovesicles carrying rapamycin (FNVs@RAPA) to address early IRI and Ly6C+Ly6G&#8722; inflammatory macrophage&#8208;mediated rejection in heart transplantation. The FNVs comprise Exocarpium Citri grandis&#8208;derived extracellular nanovesicles (ENVs) with anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles expressing calreticulin (CNVs) with macrophage&#8208;targeting ability. A novel ROS&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal chemistry approach facilitates the active targeting delivery of FNVs@RAPA to the heart graft site, effectively alleviating IRI and promoting the polarization of Ly6C+Ly6G&#8722; inflammatory macrophages toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Hence, FNVs@RAPA represents a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating early transplantation complications and immune rejection. The fusion&#8208;targeted delivery strategy offers superior heart graft site enrichment and macrophage&#8208;specific targeting, promising improved transplant outcomes.

         <title>Spin Gapless Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum materials, with nontrivial quantum phenomena and mechanisms, promise efficient quantum technologies with enhanced functionalities. Quantum technology is held back because a gap between fundamental science and its implementation is not fully understood yet. In order to capitalize the quantum advantage, a new perspective is required to figure&#160;out and close this gap. In this review, spin gapless quantum materials, featured by fully spin&#8208;polarized bands and the electron/hole transport, are discussed from the perspective of fundamental understanding and device applications. Spin gapless quantum materials can be simulated by a minimal two&#8208;band models and could help to understand band structure engineering in various topological quantum materials discovered so far. It is explicitly highlighted that various types of spin gapless band dispersion are fundamental ingredients to understand quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on conventional transport in the bulk and topological transport on the boundaries, various spintronic device aspects of spin gapless quantum materials as well as their advantages in different models for topological field effect transistors are&#160;reviewed.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine originated from amino acid sarcosine (N&#8208;methylglycine) for protein&#8208;repulsive effect, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduced the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis revealed that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, the developed multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden versus untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

         <title>Living Synthelectronics: A New Era for Bioelectronics Powered by Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of hybrid electronics combining genetically edited living organisms with nonliving bioelectronics, which is defined as living synthelectronics, is emerging recently. They use engineered cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power source and show many unique properties such as intrinsic self&#8208;healing and dynamic programming ability. The living synthelectronics is expected to provide new possibilities for future bioelectronics.








Abstract
Bioelectronics, which converges biology and electronics, has attracted great attention due to their vital applications in human&#8211;machine interfaces. While traditional bioelectronic devices utilize nonliving organic and/or inorganic materials to achieve flexibility and stretchability, a biological mismatch is often encountered because human tissues are characterized not only by softness and stretchability but also by biodynamic and adaptive properties. Recently, a notable paradigm shift has emerged in bioelectronics, where living cells, and even viruses, modified via gene editing within synthetic biology, are used as core components in a new hybrid electronics paradigm. These devices are defined as &#8220;living synthelectronics,&#8221; and they offer enhanced potential for interfacing with human tissues at informational and substance exchange levels. In this Perspective, the recent advances in living synthelectronics are summarized. First, opportunities brought to electronics by synthetic biology are briefly introduced. Then, strategic approaches to designing and making electronic devices using living cells/viruses as the building blocks, sensing components, or power sources are reviewed. Finally, the challenges faced by living synthelectronics are raised. It is believed that this paradigm shift will significantly contribute to the real integration of bioelectronics with human tissues.

         <title>Revitalizing Oxygen Reduction Reactivity of Composite Oxide Electrodes via Electrochemically Deposited PrOx Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presents a concise, straightforward approach and mechanistic insight that enables high activity in all&#8208;ceramic electrodes, providing both industrial and academic value. An old&#8208;fashioned composite oxide cathode (i.e., LSM&#8211;YSZ) in which a Pr&#8208;based nanocatalyst is introduced using an &#8216;electrochemical deposition approach&#8217; shows reinvigorated electrochemical performance, shedding new light on its potential as an air electrode.








Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells that operate at intermediate temperatures require efficient catalysts to enhance the inherently poor electrochemical activity of the composite electrodes. Here, a simple and practical electrochemical deposition method is presented for fabricating a PrOx overlayer on lanthanum strontium manganite&#8211;yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (LSM&#8211;YSZ) composite electrodes. The method requires less than four minutes for completion and can be carried out under at ambient temperature and pressure. Crucially, the treatment significantly improves the electrode's performance without requiring heat treatment or other supplementary processes. The PrOx&#8208;coated LSM&#8211;YSZ electrode exhibits an 89% decrease in polarization resistance at 650&#160;&#176;C (compared to an untreated electrode), maintaining a tenfold reduction after &#8776;400&#160;h. Transmission line model analysis using impedance spectra confirms how PrOx coating improved the oxygen reduction reaction activity. Further, tests with anode&#8208;supported single cells reveal an outstanding peak power density compared to those of other LSM&#8211;YSZ&#8208;based cathodes (e.g., 418&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that multicomponent coating, such as (Pr,Ce)Ox, can also be obtained with this method. Overall, the observations offer a promising route for the development of high&#8208;performance solid oxide fuel cells.

         <title>Giant X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal Invariant Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reveals a new type of altermagnet, in which the symmetry allows for typical ferromagnetic behaviors. It presents X&#8208;ray circular dichroism observed in a chiral antiferromagnet with time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This phenomenon contrasts conventional X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism. As X&#8208;rays propagate through the material, the Berry curvature, arising from the inversion symmetry breaking, gives rise to distinct circular dichroism.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X&#8208;ray absorption between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically lack X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time&#8208;reversal symmetry, yet exhibit weak X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism. Here, the observation of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption of Ni3TeO6 is reported, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time&#8208;reversal symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, a phenomenological model is proposed that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X&#8208;ray polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism, revealing typical ferromagnetic behaviors allowed by the symmetry in an antiferromagnet, i.e., the altermagnetism of Ni3TeO6. The findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, the first example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism is established with time&#8208;reversal&#160;symmetry.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Derived, Hetero&#8208;Structured, Pro&#8208;Healing Bioadhesive Patch for High&#8208;Performance Sealing of Wet Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is potentially adaptable to broad applications, under different pH values and air or liquid pressures, in sutureless wound sealing and healing.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising alternatives to sutures and staples to achieve wound closure and hemostasis. However, they often do not work well on tissues that are soaked in blood or other biological fluids, and organs that are typically exposed to a variety of harsh environments such as different pH values, nonhomogeneous distortions, continuous expansions and contractions, or high pressures. In this study, a nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is successfully applied for the sealing and healing of tissue defects within 10 s in diverse extreme injury scenarios in vivo including rat stomach perforation, small intestine perforation, fetal membrane defect, porcine carotid artery incision, and lung lobe laceration. The findings reveal a promising new type of self&#8208;adhesive regenerative SSAD&#8208;Patch, which is potentially adaptable to broad applications (under different pH values and air or liquid pressures) in sutureless wound sealing and healing.

A Pt(O^N^C^N) complex (tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf) with high intermolecular bonding energy, exhibiting efficient emission in both monomer and aggregate states, is designed. Color&#8208;tunable OLEDs (CT&#8208;OLEDs) with single tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf, achieving large color&#8208;tuning range, high maximum EQE (30%), and excellent lifetime (&gt;500,000 hours), are fabricated. Electromyography&#8208;visualization system equipped with CT&#8208;OLED provides a viable option for CT&#8208;OLED applications in wearable biomedical sensors.








Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CT&#8208;OLEDs) have a large color&#8208;tuning range, high efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance, making them ideal for human&#8208;machine interactive terminals of wearable biomedical devices. However, the device operational lifetime of CT&#8208;OLEDs is currently far from reaching practical requirements. To address this problem, a tetradentate Pt(II) complex named tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf, which can emit efficiently in both monomer and aggregation states, is designed. This emitter has high Td of 508&#160;&#176;C and large intermolecular bonding energy of &#8208;52.0&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8315;1, which improve its thermal/chemical stability. This unique single&#8208;emitter CT&#8208;OLED essentially avoids the &#8220;color&#8208;aging issue&#8221; and achieves a large color&#8208;tuning span (red to yellowish green) and a high external quantum efficiency &#65288;EQE&#65289; of &#8776;30% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 as well as an EQE of above 25% at 10000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A superior LT90 operational lifetime of 520,536 h at a functional luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is over 20 times longer than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CT&#8208;OLEDs, is estimated. To demonstrate the potential application of such OLEDs in wearable biomedical devices, a simple electromyography (EMG)&#8208;visualization system is fabricated using the CT&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Focusing Micromechanical Polaritons in Topologically Nontrivial Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study takes a micromechanical approach to unlock topologically resilient vibrating polaritons in analog to van der Waals nanophotonics. It is shown that due to the embedded topological protection, hyperbolic focused radiation remains resilient against random defects.








Abstract
Vertically stacked multiple atomically thin layers have recently widened the landscape of rich optical structures thanks to these quantum metamaterials or van der Waals (vdW) materials, featuring hyperbolic polaritons with unprecedented avenues for light. Despite their far&#8208;reaching implications, most of their properties rest entirely on a trivial band topological origin. Here, a 2D approach is adopted toward a micromechanical vdW analogue that, as a result of engineered chiral and mirror symmetries, provides topologically resilient hyperbolic radiation of mechanical vibrations in the ultrasonic regime. By applying laser vibrometry of the micrometer&#8208;sized metasurface, we are able to exhibit the exotic fingerprints of robust hyperbolic radiation spanning several frequencies, which beyond their physical relevance, may enable ultrasonic&#160;technologies.

Using a thermoformed&#8208;based microwell platform culture conditions are identified to create human monochorionic twin blastoids from na&#239;ve pluripotent stem cells. Twin blastoids form through division of the pluripotent cell mass and implant with higher efficiency than singleton blastoids in a microfluidic endometrium&#8208;on&#8208;chip adhesion assay. This technology opens new avenues for in&#8208;depth exploration of monochorionic twin formation and its developmental implications.








Abstract
Monochorionic twinning of human embryos increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The rarity of such twinning events, combined with ethical constraints in human embryo research, makes investigating the mechanisms behind twinning practically infeasible. As a result, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the origins and early phenotypic presentation of monochorionic twin embryos. In this study, a microthermoformed&#8208;based microwell screening platform is used to identify conditions that efficiently induce monochorionic twins in human stem cell&#8208;based blastocyst models, termed &#8220;twin blastoids&#8221;. These twin blastoids contain a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium encasing two distinct inner cell masses (ICMs). Morphological and morphokinetic analyses reveal that twinning occurs during the cavitation phase via splitting of the OCT4+ pluripotent core. Notably, each ICM in twin blastoids contains its own NR2F2+ polar trophectoderm&#8208;like region, ready for implantation. This is functionally tested in a microfluidic chip&#8208;based implantation assay with epithelial endometrium cells. Under defined flow regimes, twin blastoids show increased adhesion capacity compared to singleton blastoids, suggestive of increased implantation potential. In conclusion, the development of technology enabling large&#8208;scale formation of twin blastoids, coupled with high&#8208;sensitivity readout capabilities, presents an unprecedented opportunity for systematically exploring monochorionic twin formation and its impact on embryonic development.

         <title>Single Atom Catalysts Remodel Tumor Microenvironment for Augmented Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy using Pd&#948;+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The introduction of rich Pd&#948;+ single atoms atomically dispersed in Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty nanosheets can dramatically augment sono&#8208;immunotherapy efficacy against primary and abscopal tumors through reactive oxygen species induced immunogenic cell death.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a huge hurdle in immunotherapy. Sono&#8208;immunotherapy is a new treatment modality that can reverse immunosuppressive TME, but the sonodynamic effects are compromised by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in the TME. Herein, this work reports a new sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy using Pd&#948;+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono&#8208;suppressive TME. To demonstrate this technique, this work employs rich and reductive Ti vacancies in Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty nanosheets to construct the atomically dispersed Pd&#8208;C3 single atom catalysts (SAC) with Pd content up to 2.5 wt% (PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty). Compared with Pd nanoparticle loaded Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty, PdSA/Ti3&#8208;xC2Ty single&#8208;atom enzyme showed augmented sonodynamic effects that are ascribed to SAC facilitated electron&#8211;hole separation, rapid depletion of overexpressed GSH by ultrasound (US) excited holes, and catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 for relieving hypoxia. Importantly, the sono&#8208;immunotherapy strategy can boost abscopal antitumor immune responses by driving maturation of dendritic cells and polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages into the antitumoral M1 phenotype. Bilateral tumor models demonstrate the complete eradication of localized tumors and enhance metastatic regression. Th strategy highlights the potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts for robust sono&#8208;immunotherapy by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Realizing Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 25.6% Through Crystallization Kinetics and Spatial Orientation Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating Hydantoin into the precursor, the crystallization kinetics of perovskite is effectively regulated, resulting in the formation of perovskite films with a highly&#8208;oriented out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. This enhancement is accompanied by a significant reduction in defect density, leading to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a remarkable efficiency of 25.66% (certified 25.15%) and outstanding stability.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, owing to the exceptional optoelectronic properties and low cost. Nonetheless, the performance and stability of solar cells suffer from the defect states of perovskite films aroused by non&#8208;optically active phases and non&#8208;centralized crystal orientation. Herein, a versatile organic molecule, Hydantoin, to modulate the crystallization of perovskite, is developed. Benefiting from the diverse functional groups, more spatially oriented perovskite films with high crystallinity are formed. This enhancement is accompanied by a conspicuous reduction in defect density, yielding efficiency of 25.66% (certified 25.15%), with superb environmental stability. Notably, under the standard measurement conditions (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1I), the maximum power point (MPP) output maintains 96.8% of the initial efficiency for 1600 h and exhibits excellent ion migration suppression. The synergistic regulation of crystallization and spatial orientation offers novel avenues for propelling perovskite solar cell (PSC) development.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale, Vertically Aligned 2D Subnanochannel Arrays by a Smectic Liquid Crystal Network for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays in a smectic liquid crystal network is fabricated by photo&#8208;polymerization. As&#8208;prepared membrane demonstrates a power output of &#8776;22.5 W m&#8722;2 when mixing artificial river water and seawater based on its 2D directional nanochannels and high charge density. This work first presents the great potential of liquid crystal materials in osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
The osmotic energy, an abundant renewable energy source, can be directly converted to electricity by nanofluidic devices with ion&#8208;selective membranes. 2D nanochannels constructed by nanosheets possess abundant lateral interfacial ion&#8208;exchange sites and exhibit great superiority in nanofluidic devices. However, the most accessible orientation of the 2D nanochannels is parallel to the membrane surface, undoubtedly resulting in the conductivity loss. Herein, first vertically aligned 2D subnanochannel arrays self&#8208;assembled by a smectic liquid crystal (LC) network that exhibit high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion are demonstrated. The 2D subnanochannel arrays are fabricated by in situ photopolymerization of monomers in the LC phase. The as&#8208;prepared membrane exhibits excellent water&#8208;resistance and mechanical strength. The 2D subnanochannels with excellent cation selectivity and conductivity show high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. The power density reaches up to about 22.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 with NaCl solution under a 50&#8208;fold concentration gradient, which is among with ultrahigh power density. This membrane design concept provides promising applications in osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Building&#8208;Envelope&#8208;Inspired, Thermomechanically Robust All&#8208;Fiber Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel for Temperature&#8208;Controlled Dominant Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel mimicking the structure of a building envelope is fabricated. The prepared meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits high compressibility, extreme temperature&#8208;invariance of dynamic mechanical properties, superior thermal shock resistance, and infrared camouflage performance in the fields of national defense and aerospace.








Abstract
The unsatisfactory properties of ceramic aerogels when subjected to thermal shock, such as strength degradation and structural collapse, render them unsuitable for use at large thermal gradients or prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures. Here, a building&#8208;envelope&#8208;inspired design for fabricating a thermomechanically robust all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel with interlocked fibrous interfaces and an interwoven cellular structure in the orthogonal directions is presented, which is achieved through a two&#8208;stage physical and chemical process. Inspired by the reinforced concrete building envelope, a solid foundation composed of fibrous frames is constructed and enhanced through supramolecular in situ self&#8208;assembly to achieve high compressibility, retaining over 90% of maximum stress under a considerable compressive strain of 50% for 10&#8239;000 cycles, and showing temperature&#8208;invariance when compressed at 60% strain within the range of &#8722;100 to 500 &#176;C. As a result of its distinct response to oscillation tolerance coupled with elastic recovery, the all&#8208;fiber ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits exceptional suitability for thermal shock resistance and infrared camouflage performance in cold (&#8722;196 &#176;C) and hot (1300 &#176;C) fields. This study provides an opportunity for developing ceramic aerogels for effective thermal management under extreme conditions.

     alt="Building-Envelope-Inspired, Thermomechanically Robust All-Fiber Ceramic Meta-Aerogel for Temperature-Controlled Dominant Infrared Camouflage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-fiber ceramic meta-aerogel mimicking the structure of a building envelope is fabricated. The prepared meta-aerogel exhibits high compressibility, extreme temperature-invariance of dynamic mechanical properties, superior thermal shock resistance, and infrared camouflage performance in the fields of national defense and aerospace.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsatisfactory properties of ceramic aerogels when subjected to thermal shock, such as strength degradation and structural collapse, render them unsuitable for use at large thermal gradients or prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures. Here, a building-envelope-inspired design for fabricating a thermomechanically robust all-fiber ceramic meta-aerogel with interlocked fibrous interfaces and an interwoven cellular structure in the orthogonal directions is presented, which is achieved through a two-stage physical and chemical process. Inspired by the reinforced concrete building envelope, a solid foundation composed of fibrous frames is constructed and enhanced through supramolecular in situ self-assembly to achieve high compressibility, retaining over 90% of maximum stress under a considerable compressive strain of 50% for 10&#8239;000 cycles, and showing temperature-invariance when compressed at 60% strain within the range of &#8722;100 to 500 &#176;C. As a result of its distinct response to oscillation tolerance coupled with elastic recovery, the all-fiber ceramic meta-aerogel exhibits exceptional suitability for thermal shock resistance and infrared camouflage performance in cold (&#8722;196 &#176;C) and hot (1300 &#176;C) fields. This study provides an opportunity for developing ceramic aerogels for effective thermal management under extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Curable 3D Printing of Circularly Polarized Afterglow Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Monoliths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;(MOFs) nanoparticles with different afterglow times are prepared by combining chiral induction approach and auxiliary ligands regulation strategy, displaying tunable circularly polarized luminescence afterglow performance. Furthermore, the corresponding chiral MOFs nanoparticles are first prepared to various chiral monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications.








Abstract
Developing coordination complexes (such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MOFs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is currently attracting tremendous attention and remains a significant challenge in achieving MOF with circularly polarized afterglow. Herein, MOFs&#8208;based circularly polarized afterglow is first reported by combining the chiral induction approach and tuning the afterglow times by using the auxiliary ligands regulation strategy. The obtained chiral R/S&#8208;ZnIDC, R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpy), and R/S&#8208;ZnIDC(bpe)(IDC = 1H&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, bpy = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine, bpe = trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl) ethylene) containing a similar structure unit display different afterglow times with 3, 1, and &lt;0.1&#160;s respectively which attribute to that the longer auxiliary ligand hinders the energy transfer through the hydrogen bonding. The obtained chiral complexes reveal a strong chiral signal, obvious photoluminescence afterglow feature, and strong CPL performance (glum up to 3.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2). Furthermore, the photo&#8208;curing 3D printing method is first proposed to prepare various chiral MOFs based monoliths from 2D patterns to 3D scaffolds for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. This work not only develops chiral complexes monoliths by photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technique but opens a new strategy to achieve tunable CPL afterglow in optical applications.

         <title>Topological Complex Charge Conservation in Nontrivial Z2 &#215; Z2 Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel conserved quantity for topological domain wall networks of a generic Z2 &#215; Z2&#160;order is discovered. Spin&#8208;polarized current generates and mobilizes Z2 &#215; Z2 domain walls in Sr2VO3FeAs, leading to merge, bifurcation, pair creation, and annihilation. Within these active dynamics, the product of the topological complex charges defined for domain wall vertices is conserved with a novel boundary&#8208;charge correspondence rule.








Abstract
Localized topological modes such as solitons, Majorana Fermions, and skyrmions are attracting great interest as robust information carriers for future devices. Here, a novel conserved quantity for topological domain wall networks of a Z2 &#215;&#160;Z2&#160;order generated with spin&#8208;polarized current in Sr2VO3FeAs is discovered. Domain walls are mobilized by the scanning tunneling current, which also observes in atomic scale active dynamics of domain wall vertices including merge, bifurcation, pair creation, and annihilation. Within this dynamics, the product of the topological complex charges defined for domain wall vertices is conserved with a novel boundary&#8208;charge correspondence rule. These results may open an avenue toward topological electronics based on domain wall vertices in generic Z2 &#215;&#160;Z2&#160;systems.

         <title>Stretch&#8208;Induced Conductivity Enhancement in Highly Conductive and Tough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive and tough hydrogels composed of liquid metal (LM), silver nanowires (AgNWs), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are constructed. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline form conductive pathways and enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels, including ultimate fracture stress, strain, toughness, and dramatically enhance the electrical conductivity (from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 at 4200% strain).








Abstract
The resistance of gels and elastomers increases significantly with tensile strain, which reduces conductive stability and restricts their use in stable and reliable electronics. Here, highly conductive tough hydrogels composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs), liquid metal (LM), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are fabricated. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline create conductive pathways, enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, including increased ultimate fracture stress (13&#8208;33&#160;MPa), strain (3000&#8211;5300%), and toughness (390.9&#8211;765.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Notably, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogels is significantly improved from 4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 when stretched to 4200% strain, representing a 6000&#8208;fold enhancement. The incorporation of PVA nanocrystalline, deformable LM, and AgNWs effectively mitigates stress concentration at the crack tip, thereby conferring crack propagation insensitivity and fatigue resistance to the hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels are designed with a reversible crosslinking network, allowing for water&#8208;induced recycling.

         <title>Conversion of Layered WS2 Crystals into Mixed&#8208;Domain Electrochemical Catalysts by Plasma&#8208;Assisted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports an approach to maximize the electrocatalytic performance of mechanically exfoliated WS2 through sequential plasma treatments. This dry process can spatially tune the level of surface oxidation as well as the concentration of sulfur vacancies such that compositionally graded, mixed&#8208;domain electrochemical catalysts induced hydrogen evolution reaction performance greater than platinum with high stability over centimeter&#8208;scale areas.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is crucial to generate clean hydrogen fuel, but implementation at an industrial scale remains limited due to dependence on expensive platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an all&#8208;dry process to transform electrochemically inert bulk WS2 into a multidomain electrochemical catalyst that enables scalable and cost&#8208;effective implementation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis is reported. Direct dry transfer of WS2 flakes to a gold thin film deposited on a silicon substrate provides a general platform to produce the working electrodes for HER with tunable charge transfer resistance. By treating the mechanically exfoliated WS2 with sequential Ar&#8208;O2 plasma, mixed domains of WS2, WO3, and tungsten oxysulfide form on the surfaces of the flakes, which gives rise to a superior HER with much greater long&#8208;term stability and steady&#8208;state activity compared to Pt. Using density functional theory, ultraefficient atomic sites formed on the constituent nanodomains are identified, and the quantification of atomic&#8208;scale reactivities and resulting HER activities fully support the experimental observations.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm IrRuNiMoCo High&#8208;Entropy Alloy with Iridium&#8208;Rich Medium&#8208;Entropy Oxide Shell to Boost Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles with iridium&#8208;rich medium&#8208;entropy oxides shell exhibit unprecedented activity and stability in proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. The lattice distortion and slow diffusion effect retard the migration and dissolution of the transition metals, thus enhancing the corrosion resistance.








Abstract
Ensuring high catalytic activity and durability at low iridium&#160;(Ir)usage is still a big challenge for the development of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, a rapid liquid&#8208;reduction combined with surface galvanic replacement strategy is reported to synthesize the sub 2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles featured with Ir&#8208;rich IrRuNiMo medium&#8208;entropy oxide shell (Ir&#8208;MEO) and a IrRuCoNiMo HEA core (HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO). Advanced spectroscopies reveal that the Ir&#8208;rich MEO shell inhibits the severe structural evolution of transition metals upon the OER, thus guaranteeing the structural stability. In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, activation energy analysis and theoretical calculations unveil that the OER on HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO follows an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway, where the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is substantially lowered. The optimized catalyst delivers the excellent performance (1.85&#160;V/3.0 A cm&#8722;2@80&#160;&#176;C), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;500 h@1.0 Acm&#8722;2), and low energy consumption (3.98&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 @1.0 A cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE with low Ir usage of &#8776;0.4 mg cm&#8722;2, realizing the dramatical reduction of hydrogen (H2) production cost to 0.88 dollar&#160;per kg (H2).

         <title>Enhancing the Thermoelectric Properties of Conjugated Polymers by Suppressing Dopant&#8208;Induced Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By creating well&#8208;defined molecular cavities in P3HT&#8208;based random copolymers, the dopant&#8208;induced disorder is suppressed upon IEx&#8208;doing of the polymers, leading to optimized molecular packing with minimized structural disorder, resulting in electrical conductivities in excess of 400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, ranking them the highest ever reports for P3HT&#8208;based polymers without chain alignment.








Abstract
Doping is a crucial strategy to enhance the performance of various organic electronic devices. However, in many cases, the random distribution of dopants in conjugated polymers leads to the disruption of the polymer microstructure, severely constraining the achievable performance of electronic devices. Here, it is shown that by ion&#8208;exchange doping polythiophene&#8208;based P[(3HT)1&#8208;x&#8208;stat&#8208;(T)x] (x&#160;=&#160;0 (P1), 0.12 (P2), 0.24 (P3), and 0.36 (P4)), remarkably high electrical conductivity of &gt;400&#160;S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 are achieved for the random copolymer P3, ranking it among highest ever reported for unaligned P3HT&#8208;based films, significantly higher than that of P1 (&lt;40&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, &lt;4&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2). Although both polymers exhibit comparable field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobilities of &#8776;0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 in the pristine state, after doping, Hall effect measurements indicate that P3 exhibits a large Hall mobility up to 1.2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, significantly outperforming that of P1 (0.06&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). GIWAXS measurement determines that the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance of doped P3 is 3.44&#160;&#197;, distinctly shorter than that of doped P1 (3.68&#160;&#197;). These findings contribute to resolving the long&#8208;standing dopant&#8208;induced&#8208;disorder issues in P3HT and serve as an example for achieving fast charge transport in highly doped polymers for efficient electronics.

         <title>Ingestible Artificial Urinary Biomarker Probes for Urine Test of Gastrointestinal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingestible artificial urinary biomarker probe can specifically react with cancer biomarkers in colon tumors and subsequently release renal&#8208;clearable small tetrazine fragments, allowing for fluorescence turn&#8208;on urine detection via bioorthogonal reaction with a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged fluorophore.








Abstract
Although colorectal cancer diagnosed at an early stage shows high curability, methods simultaneously possessing point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing ability and high sensitivity are limited. Here, an orally deliverable biomarker&#8208;activatable probe (termed as HATS) for early detection of orthotopic tumors via remote urinalysis is presented. To enable its oral delivery to the colon, HATS is designed to have remarkable resistance to acidity and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine and negligible intestinal absorption. Upon reaction with a cancer biomarker in the colon segment, HATS releases a small fragment of tetrazine that can transverse the intestinal barrier, enter blood circulation, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to urine. Subsequently, the urinary tetrazine fragment is detected by bioorthogonal reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged resorufin (TCO&#8208;Reso) to afford a rapid and specific fluorescence enhancement of TCO&#8208;Reso. Such signal readout is correlated with the urinary tetrazine concentration and thus measures the level of cancer biomarkers in the colon. HATS&#8208;based optical urinalysis detects orthotopic colon tumors two weeks earlier than clinical serological tests and can be developed to a point&#8208;of&#8208;care paper test. Thereby, HATS&#8208;based urinalysis provides a non&#8208;invasive and sensitive approach to cancer screening at low&#8208;resource settings.

         <title>A Multimodal Self&#8208;Propelling Tensegrity Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can continuously extract energy from the hot surface and undertake self&#8208;propelling rolling. By adjusting the position of the active cables, the HTS can roll in different repetitive locomotive modes autonomously in response to thermal stimuli.








Abstract
Tensegrity structure is composed of tensile cables and compressive rods, offering high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;mass ratio, deploy ability, and excellent energy damping capability. The active and dynamic tensegrity designs demonstrate great potential for soft robots. In previous designs, the movement has relied on carefully controlled input power or manually controlled light irradiation, limiting their potential applications. Here, a hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, nonresponsive cables, and stiff rods. The HTS can self&#8208;propel continuously on a hot surface due to its unique geometry. The HTS allows for the easy achievement of multimodal self&#8208;propelled locomotive modes, which has been challenging for previously demonstrated self&#8208;propelling structures. Additionally, using Velcro tapes to adhere the rods and cables together, a modulable and reassemblable HTS is created. The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self&#8208;propelling and modulable robots.

The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self-propelling and modulable robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Dual Alignments Introduce Synergistic Effect on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Platelets for Superior Thermal Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet partial alignment by a directional shear force facilitates the axial rotation of the platelets for subsequent planar alignment under an external&#8208;force&#8208;couple&#8208;induced torque, and the sequential dual alignments result in a synergistic alignment effect. The realization of planar alignment of hexagonal boron nitride platelets is reported using the sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach when printing in a yield&#8208;stress support bath.








Abstract
Planarly aligning 2D platelets is challenging due to their additional orientational freedom compared to 1D materials. This study reports a sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach, employing an extrusion&#8208;printing&#8208;induced shear force and rotating&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced force couple for platelet planarly alignment in a yield&#8208;stress support bath. It is hypothesized that the partial alignment induced by a directional shear force facilitates subsequent axial rotation of the platelets for planar alignment under an external force couple, resulting in a synergistic alignment effect. This sequential dual&#8208;alignment approach achieves better planar alignment of 2D modified hexagonal boron nitride (mhBN). Specifically, the thermal conductivity of the 40 wt% mhBN/epoxy composite is significantly higher (692%) than that of unaligned composites, surpassing the cumulative effect of individual methods (only 133%) with a 5 times more synergistic effect. For 30, 40, and 50 wt% mhBN composites, the thermal conductivity values (5.9, 9.5, and 13.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) show considerable improvement compared to the previously reported highest values (5.3, 6.6, and 8.6&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Additionally, a 3D mhBN/epoxy heat sink is printed and evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of device fabrication. The approach enables the planar alignment of electrically or thermally conducting 2D fillers during 3D fabrication.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Thermal&#8208;Shock Resistance Enabled by Radiative Cooling and Latent Heat Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage is proposed to enable thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance. The radiative film allows excellent subambient performance. When subjected to thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop by isothermal heat absorption. The molten phase change materials provide heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting heat to delayed release.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is well known for its subambient temperature cooling performance under sunlight radiation. However, the intrinsic maximum cooling power of radiative cooling limits the performance when the objects meet the thermal shock. Here, a dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage simultaneously enabling the efficient subambient cooling and high&#8208;efficiency thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance is proposed. The electrospinning and absorption&#8208;pressing methods are used to assemble the dual&#8208;function cooler. The high sunlight reflectivity and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of radiative film allow excellent subambient temperature of 5.1&#160;&#176;C. When subjected the thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop of 39&#160;&#176;C and stable low&#8208;temperature level by isothermal heat absorption compared with the traditional radiative cooler. The molten phase change materials provide the heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting thermal&#8208;shock heat to the delayed preservation. This strategy paves a powerful way to protect the objects from thermal accumulation and high&#8208;temperature damage, expanding the applications of radiative cooling and latent heat storage technologies.

         <title>Polymerizing M&#8208;Series Acceptors for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells: Effect of the Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear&#8208;shaped ADA&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMA) is shown to be more advantageous to build polymer acceptors with high charge transport and photovoltaic properties than the banana&#8208;shaped one. The polymer acceptor based on the linear&#8208;shape ADA&#8208;type SMA exhibits a high efficiency of 15.65% in binary devices and an outstanding efficiency of 18.0% in ternary devices with a PM6:M36 host blend.








Abstract
Currently, high&#8208;performance polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs) based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs are still rare and greatly demanded for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, two novel regioregular PSMAs (PW&#8208;Se and PS&#8208;Se) are designed and synthesized by using centrosymmetric (linear&#8208;shaped) and axisymmetric (banana&#8208;shaped) ADA&#8208;type SMAs as the main building blocks, respectively. It is demonstrated that photovoltaic performance of the PSMAs can be significantly improved by optimizing the configuration of ADA&#8208;type SMAs. Compared to the axisymmetric SMA&#8208;based polymer (PS&#8208;Se), PW&#8208;Se using a centrosymmetric SMA as the main building block exhibits better backbone coplanarity thereby resulting in bathochromically shifted absorption with a higher absorption coefficient, tighter interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and more favorable blend film morphology. As a result, enhanced and more&#8208;balanced charge transport, better exciton dissociation, and reduced charge recombination are achieved for PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices with PM6 as polymer donor. Benefiting from these positive factors, the optimal PM6:PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based device exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.65% compared to the PM6:PS&#8208;Se&#8208;based device (8.90%). Furthermore, incorporation of PW&#8208;Se as a third component in the binary active layer of PM6:M36 yields ternary devices with an outstanding PCE of 18.0%, which is the highest value for PSCs based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs, to the best of the knowledge.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields in Strain&#8208;Engineered WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positions of spectrally pure quantum emitters in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are mapped to the underlying strain field with a resolution below the diffraction limit (&#8776;30&#160;nm). The quantum emitters are displaced from the local strain maxima by an average distance of 240&#160;nm, which contradicts the assumption that strain&#8208;induced quantum emitters are concentrated at the local strain maxima.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single&#8208;photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow&#8208;linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240&#160;nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain&#8208;engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next&#8208;generation quantum optical architectures.

         <title>Pyroelectric Photoconductive Diode for Highly Sensitive and Fast DUV Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors is a huge challenge. This work proposes a strategy to boost detection performance by coupling the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on engineered polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx Schottky photodiode (i.e., pyroelectric photoconductive diodes). The pyroelectric photoconductive diodes exhibit ultrahigh detection performance for deep ultraviolet and X&#8208;ray light.








Abstract
Detecting high&#8208;energy photons from the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to X&#8208;rays is vital in security, medicine, industry, and science. Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors exhibit great potential for detecting high&#8208;energy photons. However, the implementation of highly sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors based on WBG semiconductors has been a huge challenge due to the inevitable deep level traps and the lack of appropriate device structure engineering. Here, a sensitive and fast pyroelectric photoconductive diode (PPD), which couples the interface pyroelectric effect with the photoconductive effect based on tailored polycrystal Ga&#8208;rich GaOx (PGR&#8208;GaOx) Schottky photodiode, is first proposed. The PPD device exhibits ultrahigh detection performance for DUV and X&#8208;ray light. The responsivity for DUV light and sensitivity for X&#8208;ray are up to 104 A W&#8722;1 and 105 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. Especially, the interface pyroelectric effect induced by polar symmetry in the depletion region of the PGR&#8208;GaOx can significantly improve the response speed of the device by 105 times. Furthermore, the potential of the device is demonstrated for imaging enhancement systems with low power consumption and high sensitivity. This work fully excavates the potential of the pyroelectric effect for detectors and provides a novel design strategy to achieve sensitive and high&#8208;speed detectors.

         <title>Deciphering the Performance Enhancement, Cell Failure Mechanism, and Amelioration Strategy of Sodium Storage in Metal Chalcogenides&#8208;Based Andes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) materials can achieve excellent performance in ether&#8208;based electrolyte with Cu current collector but suffers from inevitable cycle life termination. It is delved into the origins of performance enhancement and the mechanisms behind cell failure in TMC&#8208;based anodes when paired with ether&#8208;based electrolytes, while also proposed effective strategies to mitigate such failures.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether&#8208;based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. The investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling&#8208;induced stress, being the main reason for ultrastable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the microshort&#8208;circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, a predictive framework linking electrode longevity is established to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and microshort&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Assembly of Interfacial Polyelectrolyte Complexation Fibers with Mineralization Gradient for Physiologically&#8208;Inspired Ligament Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a physiologically&#8208;inspired ligament regeneration with biomimetic hierarchical architecture, viscoelasticity, and enthesis&#8208;like mineralization gradient. Through these advancements, this research aims at improving clinical outcomes, facilitating patient recovery, and provide a long&#8208;lasting and effective solution for ligament injuries.








Abstract
Current synthetic grafts for ligament rupture repair often fail to integrate well with the surrounding biological tissue, leading to complications such as graft wear, fatigue, and subsequent re&#8208;rupture. To address this medical challenge, this study aims at advancing the development of a biological ligament through the integration of physiologically&#8208;inspired principles and tissue engineering strategies. In this study, interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation (IPC) spinning technique, along with a custom&#8208;designed collection system, to fabricate a hierarchical scaffold mimicking native ligament structure, is utilized. To emulate the bone&#8208;ligament interface and alleviate stress concentration, a hydroxyapatite (HAp) mineral gradient is strategically introduced near both ends of the scaffold to enhance interface integration and diminish the risk of avulsion rupture. Biomimetic viscoelasticity is successfully displayed to provide similar mechanical support to native ligamentous tissue under physiological conditions. By introducing the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and conducting mesenchymal stem cells transplantation, the regenerative potential of the synthetic ligament is significantly amplified. This pioneering study offers a multifaceted solution combining biomimetic materials, regenerative therapies, and advanced techniques to potentially transform ligament rupture treatment.

         <title>Full&#8208;Length Single Protein Molecules Tracking and Counting in Thin Silicon Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid full&#8208;length, single protein molecules separation, tracking, and identification in ultra&#8208;high aspect ratio silicon devices. Proteins are tagged by chemo&#8208;selective dual amino&#8208;acid specific labels and are electrophoretically separated by their mass/charge in custom thin silicon channel with subwavelength height. This approach allows the analysis of thousands of individual proteins within a few minutes by tracking their motion during the migration.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;molecule protein sensing techniques are ushering in a transformative era in biomedical research. Nevertheless, challenges persist in realizing ultra&#8208;fast full&#8208;length protein sensing, including loss of molecular integrity due to protein fragmentation, biases introduced by antibodies affinity, identification of proteoforms, and low throughputs. Here, a single&#8208;molecule method for parallel protein separation and tracking is introduced, yielding multi&#8208;dimensional molecular properties used for their identification. Proteins are tagged by chemo&#8208;selective dual amino&#8208;acid specific labels and are electrophoretically separated by their mass/charge in custom&#8208;designed thin silicon channel with subwavelength height. This approach allows analysis of thousands of individual proteins within a few minutes by tracking their motion during the migration. The power of the method is demonstrated by quantifying a cytokine panel for host&#8208;response discrimination between viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, it is shown that two clinically&#8208;relevant splice isoforms of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be accurately quantified from human serum samples. Being non&#8208;destructive and compatible with full&#8208;length intact proteins, this method opens up ways for antibody&#8208;free single&#8208;protein molecule quantification.

         <title>Rational Design of New Conjugated Polymers with Main Chain Chirality for Efficient Optoelectronic Devices: Carbo[6]Helicene and Indacenodithiophene Copolymers as Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of conjugated polymers (CPs) with main chain chirality and their incorporation in devices is scarce despite promising added value. In this work, the incorporation of enantiopure helicenes into a polymer backbone results in improved performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, up to 20% increase compared to the homopolymer or the racemic analog polymers.








Abstract
The unique properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) in various optoelectronic applications are mainly attributed to their different self&#8208;assembly processes and superstructures. Various methods are utilized to tune and control CP structure and properties with less attention paid to the use of chirality. CPs with main chain chirality are rare and their microscopic and macroscopic properties are still unknown. In this work, the first experimental results are provided along these lines by synthesizing a series of racemic and enantiopure CPs containing statistical and alternating carbo[6]helicene and indacenodithiophene moieties and evaluating their microscopic (optical, energy levels) and macroscopic properties (hole mobilities, photovoltaic performance). It is demonstrated that a small statistical insertion of either the racemic or enantiopure helicene into the polymer backbone finely tunes the microscopic and macroscopic properties as a function of the statistical content. The microscopic properties of the enantiopure versus the racemic polymers with the same helicene loading remain similar. On the contrary, the macroscopic properties, and more interestingly those between the two enantiomeric forms, are altered as a function of the statistical content. Once incorporated into a solar cell device, these chiral CPs display better performance in their enantiopure versus racemic forms.

&lt;p&gt;The development of conjugated polymers (CPs) with main chain chirality and their incorporation in devices is scarce despite promising added value. In this work, the incorporation of enantiopure helicenes into a polymer backbone results in improved performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, up to 20% increase compared to the homopolymer or the racemic analog polymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) in various optoelectronic applications are mainly attributed to their different self-assembly processes and superstructures. Various methods are utilized to tune and control CP structure and properties with less attention paid to the use of chirality. CPs with main chain chirality are rare and their microscopic and macroscopic properties are still unknown. In this work, the first experimental results are provided along these lines by synthesizing a series of racemic and enantiopure CPs containing statistical and alternating carbo[6]helicene and indacenodithiophene moieties and evaluating their microscopic (optical, energy levels) and macroscopic properties (hole mobilities, photovoltaic performance). It is demonstrated that a small statistical insertion of either the racemic or enantiopure helicene into the polymer backbone finely tunes the microscopic and macroscopic properties as a function of the statistical content. The microscopic properties of the enantiopure versus the racemic polymers with the same helicene loading remain similar. On the contrary, the macroscopic properties, and more interestingly those between the two enantiomeric forms, are altered as a function of the statistical content. Once incorporated into a solar cell device, these chiral CPs display better performance in their enantiopure versus racemic forms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Hetero&#8208;Nanowire Films for Flexible and Multifunctional Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible multifunctional thermoelectric device with radiative cooling performance is fabricated by the interface assembly and in situ reaction of nanowires. The thermoelectric device can sense temperature (object and ambient), heat proximity, thermal conductivity of the object, and airflow, where the encapsulating materials endow the device with radiative cooling performance and extreme environmental tolerance.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices hold significant promise in wearable electronics owing to their capacity for green energy generation, temperature sensing, and comfortable wear. However, the simultaneous achievement of excellent multifunctional sensing and power generation poses a challenge in these devices. Here, ordered tellurium&#8208;based hetero&#8208;nanowire films are designed for flexible and multifunctional thermoelectric devices by optimizing the Seebeck coefficient and power factor. The obtained devices can efficiently detect both object and environment temperature, thermal conductivity, heat proximity, and airflow. In addition, combining the thermoelectric units with radiative cooling materials exhibits remarkable thermal management capabilities, preventing device overheating and avoiding degradation in power generation. Impressively, this multifunctional electronics exhibits excellent resistance in extreme low earth orbit environments. The fabrication of such thermoelectric devices provides innovative insights into multimodal sensing and energy harvesting.

         <title>A Freestanding, Dissolution&#8208; and Diffusion&#8208;Limiting, Flexible Sulfur Electrode Enables High Specific Capacity at High Mass Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize a practically battery with high energy density, it is crucial to achieve stable and high&#8208;loading S electrodes (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). A freestanding electrode with dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions is introduced for flexible Li&#8211;S batteries. This design offers an unconventional improvement in specific capacity at higher mass loading, excellent cycling stability, and remarkable energy density.








Abstract
The acquisition of stable and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity S cathodes over 10&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 is a critical and indispensable step to realize the high energy density configuration. However, increasing the areal capacity of S cathodes often deteriorates the specific capacity and stability due to the aggravated dissolution of S and diffusion of solvable polysulfides in the thick electrode. Herein, the design of a freestanding composite cathode that leverages 3D covalent binding sites and chemical adsorption environment to offer dissolution&#8208;limiting and diffusion&#8208;blocking functions of S species is reported. By employing this architecture, the coin cell exhibits excellent cycling stability and an exceptional specific capacity of 1444.3&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (13&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2), and the pouch cell configuration manifests a noteworthy areal capacity exceeding 11&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. This performance is coupled with excellent flexibility, demonstrated through consecutive bending cycle tests, even at a sulfur loading of 9.00&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This study lays the foundation for the development of flexible Li&#8211;S batteries with increased loading capacities and exceptional performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Enabled Printable Asymmetric Self&#8208;Insulated Stretchable Conductor for Human Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel printable, flexible material composed of conducting polymer and liquid metal, which is capable of self&#8208;assembly upon printing, producing asymmetric highly conductive stretchable conductors for human interface.








Abstract
Soft and stretchable conductors with high electrical conductivity and tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are crucial for both on&#8208;skin and implantable electronic devices. Liquid metal&#8208;based conductors hold great promise due to their metallic conductivity and minimal stiffness. However, the surface oxidation of liquid metal particles in polymeric matrices poses a challenge in forming a continuous pathway for highly conductive elastic composites. Here, it is reported a printable composite material based on liquid metal and conducting polymer that undergoes a self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high conductivity (2089 S cm&#8722;1) in the bottom surface while maintaining an insulated top surface, high stretchability (&gt;800%), and a modulus akin to human skin tissue. This material is further applied to fabricate skin&#8208;interfaced strain sensors and electromyogram sensors through 3D printing.

         <title>A Biomimetic &#8220;Salting Out&#8212;Alignment&#8212;Locking&#8221; Tactic to Design Strong and Tough Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural spider silk dragline producing process, a &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is developed in this paper. The obtained strength and toughness of gelatin hydrogels through SALT hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. The SALT also exhibits universality toward other salts and polymer systems.








Abstract
Recently, hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials have demonstrated huge potential in soft robotics, flexible electronics as well as artificial skins. Although various methods are developed to prepare tough and strong hydrogels, it is still challenging to simultaneously enhance the strength and toughness of hydrogels, especially for protein&#8208;based hydrogels. Herein, a biomimetic &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is introduced for enhancing mechanical properties through the synergy of alignment and the salting out effect. As a typical example, tensile strength and modulus of initially brittle gelatin hydrogels increase 940 folds to 10.12&#160;&#177;&#160;0.50&#160;MPa and 2830 folds to 34.26&#160;&#177;&#160;3.94&#160;MPa, respectively, and the toughness increases up to 1785 folds to 14.28&#160;&#177;&#160;3.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. The obtained strength and toughness hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. It is further elucidated that the salting out effect engenders hydrophobic domains, while prestretching facilitates chain alignment, both synergistically contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties. It is noteworthy that the SALT demonstrates remarkable versatility across different salt types and polymer systems, thus opening up new avenues for engineering strong, tough, and stiff hydrogels.

Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink onto a conductive adhesive resilient nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed which can achieve body&#8208;joint&#8208;movement&#8208;mediated strain&#8208;dependent fluorescent information and electrical signal changes.








Abstract
The interactive flexible device, which monitors the human motion in optical and electrical synergistic modes, has attracted growing attention recently. The incorporation of information attribute within the optical signal is deemed advantageous for improving the interactive efficiency. Therefore, the development of wearable optical information&#8208;electronic strain sensors holds substantial promise, but integrating and synergizing various functions and realizing strain&#8208;mediated information transformation keep challenging. Herein, an amylopectin (AP) modified nanoclay/polyacrylamide&#8208;based nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel and an aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active ink are fabricated. Through the fluorescence&#8208;transfer printing of the ink onto the hydrogel film in different strains with nested multiple symbolic information, a wearable interactive fluorescent information&#8208;electronic strain sensor is developed. In the sensor, the nanoclay plays a synergistic &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;three&#8208;birds&#8221; role, contributing to &#8220;lightening&#8221; fluorescence (&#8776;80 times emission intensity enhancement), ionic conductivity, and excellent stretchability (&gt;1000%). The sensor has high biocompatibility, resilience (elastic recovery ratio: 97.8%), and strain sensitivity (gauge factor (GF): 10.9). Additionally, the AP endows the sensor with skin adhesiveness. The sensor can achieve electrical monitoring of human joint movements while displaying interactive fluorescent information transformation. This research poses an efficient strategy to develop multifunctional materials and provides a general platform for achieving next&#8208;generation interactive devices with prospective applications in wearable devices, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Achieving Zero&#8208;Temperature Coefficient Point Behavior by Defect Passivation for Temperature&#8208;Immune Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior is first achieved by eliminating Fermi pinning using a defect passivation strategy, which complements the ZTC point theory and achieves temperature&#8208;immune organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in the variable temperature bias voltage test over 50000 s by biasing OFETs at ZTC points.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have broad prospects in biomedical, sensor, and aerospace applications. However, obtaining temperature&#8208;immune OFETs is difficult because the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are temperature&#8208;sensitive. The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior can be used to achieve a temperature&#8208;immune output current; however, it is difficult to achieve in organic devices with thermal activation characteristics, according to the existing ZTC point theory. Here, the Fermi pinning in OSCs is eliminated using the defect passivation strategy, making the Fermi level closer to the tail state at low temperatures; thus threshold voltage (VT) is negatively correlated with temperature. ZTC point behaviors in OFETs are achieved by compensation between VT and mobility at different temperatures to improve its temperature immunity. A temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in a variable&#8208;temperature bias voltage test over 50000&#160;s by biasing the device at the ZTC point. This study provides an effective solution for temperature&#8208;immune OFETs and inspiration for their practical application.

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Ionohydrogels toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal approach for synthesizing polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;reinforced ionic liquid&#8208;based gels (ILGs) and builds up an efficient bridge between them. The potential of POMs and ILGs across numerous fields, combined with structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance elucidation, has led to the identification of superior POMs&#8208;improved ILGs suitable for the fabrication of self&#8208;powered sensing systems.








Abstract
Multifunctional flexible electronics present tremendous opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital age. One potential avenue to realize this goal is the integration of polyoxometalates (POMs) and ionic liquid&#8208;based gels (ILGs), but the challenge of macrophase separation due to poor compatibility, especially caused by repulsion between like&#8208;charged units, poses a significant hurdle. Herein, the possibilities of producing diverse and homogenous POMs&#8208;containing ionohydrogels by nanoconfining POMs and ionic liquids (ILs) within an elastomer&#8208;like polyzwitterionic hydrogel using a simple one&#8208;step random copolymerization method, are expanded vastly. The incorporation of polyzwitterions provides a nanoconfined microenvironment and effectively modulates excessive electrostatic interactions in POMs/ILs/H2O blending system, facilitating a phase transition from macrophase separation to a submillimeter scale worm&#8208;like microphase&#8208;separation system. Moreover, combining POMs&#8208;reinforced ionohydrogels with a developed integrated self&#8208;powered sensing system utilizing strain sensors and Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors has enabled efficient energy storage and detection of external strain changes with high precision. This work not only provides guidelines for manipulating morphology within phase&#8208;separation gelation systems, but also paves the way for developing versatile POMs&#8208;based ionohydrogels for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart flexible electronics.

         <title>Visible Microfluidic Deprotonation for Aramid Nanofibers as Building Blocks of Cascade&#8208;Microfluidic&#8208;Processed Colloidal Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic deprotonation approach with an in situ observation function is proposed first to realize the continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers. The kinetic exfoliation process is established quantificationally, bringing about appreciable prospects for the cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.








Abstract
&#160;Microfluidic deprotonation approach is proposed to realize continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers (ANFs)&#160;by virtue of large specific surface area, high mixing efficiency, strong heat transfer capacity, narrow residence time distribution, mild laminar&#8208;flow process, and amplification&#8208;free effect of the microchannel reactor. By means of monitoring capabilities endowed by the high transparency of the microchannel, the kinetic exfoliation process of original aramid particles is in situ observed and the corresponding exfoliation mechanism is established quantificationally. The deprotonated time can be reduced from the traditional several days to 7 min for the final colloidal dispersion due to the synergistic effect between enhanced local shearing/mixing and the rotational motion of aramid particles in microchannel revealed by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the cascade microfluidic processing approach is used to make various ANF colloidal aerogels including aerogel fibers, aerogel films, and 3D&#8208;printed aerogel articles. Comprehensive characterizations show that these cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels have identical features as those prepared in batch&#8208;style mode, revealing the versatile use value of these ANFs. This work achieves significant progress toward continuous and efficient production of ANFs, bringing about appreciable prospects for the practical application of ANF&#8208;based materials and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.

         <title>Projection Stereolithography 3D Printing High&#8208;Conductive Hydrogel for Flexible Passive Wireless Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A projection stereolithography 3D printable high&#8208;conductive hydrogel is developed, which enables customization of electronic circuits. Sealing the partially dehydrated hydrogel circuits can achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1), stretchability and stability (&gt;1 month). Furthermore, the customized passive radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by assembling the printed antennas with commercial chips, which realize wireless sensing of eye movement.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electronics have inherent similarities to biological tissues and hold potential for wearable applications. However, low conductivity, poor stretchability, nonpersonalizability, and uncontrollable dehydration during use limit their further development. In this study, projection stereolithography 3D printing high&#8208;conductive hydrogel for flexible passive wireless sensing is reported. The prepared photocurable silver&#8208;based hydrogel is rapidly planarized into antenna shapes on substrates using surface projection stereolithography. After partial dehydration, silver flakes within the circuits form sufficient conductive pathways to achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&#8722;1). By sealing the circuits to prevent further dehydration, the resistance remains stable when tensile strain is less than 100% for at least 30 days. Besides, the sealing materials provide versatile functionalities, such as stretchability and shape memory property. Customized flexible radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by integrating with commercial chips to complete the accurate recognition of eye movement, realizing passive wireless sensing.

&lt;p&gt;A projection stereolithography 3D printable high-conductive hydrogel is developed, which enables customization of electronic circuits. Sealing the partially dehydrated hydrogel circuits can achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), stretchability and stability (&amp;gt;1 month). Furthermore, the customized passive radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by assembling the printed antennas with commercial chips, which realize wireless sensing of eye movement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogel-based electronics have inherent similarities to biological tissues and hold potential for wearable applications. However, low conductivity, poor stretchability, nonpersonalizability, and uncontrollable dehydration during use limit their further development. In this study, projection stereolithography 3D printing high-conductive hydrogel for flexible passive wireless sensing is reported. The prepared photocurable silver-based hydrogel is rapidly planarized into antenna shapes on substrates using surface projection stereolithography. After partial dehydration, silver flakes within the circuits form sufficient conductive pathways to achieve high conductivity (387 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). By sealing the circuits to prevent further dehydration, the resistance remains stable when tensile strain is less than 100% for at least 30 days. Besides, the sealing materials provide versatile functionalities, such as stretchability and shape memory property. Customized flexible radio frequency identification tags are fabricated by integrating with commercial chips to complete the accurate recognition of eye movement, realizing passive wireless sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermediate Phase Suppression with Long Chain Diammonium Alkane for High Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the residual of solvent in unannealed perovskite&#160;film by introducing octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide. This helps to achieve single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells with high efficiency &gt;22% and outstanding stability, and achieve high performance 4&#8208;terminal all perovskite and large area perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite can construct tandem cells with narrow bandgap solar cells by adjusting the band gap to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limitation of single junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, WBG perovskites still suffer from severe nonradiative carrier recombination and large open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. Here, this work uses an in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurement to monitor the intermediate phase evolution and crystallization process via blade coating. This work reports a strategy to fabricate efficient and stable WBG perovskite solar cells through doping a long carbon chain molecule octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide (ODADI). It is found that ODADI doping not only suppresses intermediate phases but also promote the crystallization of perovskite and passivate defects in blade coated 1.67&#160;eV WBG FA0.7Cs0.25MA0.05Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite films. As a result, the champion single junction inverted PSCs deliver the efficiencies of 22.06% and 19.63% for the active area of 0.07 and 1.02 cm2, respectively, which are the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in WBG PSCs by blade coating. The unencapsulated device demonstrates excellent stability in air, which maintains its initial efficiency at the maximum power points under constant AM 1.5G illumination in open air for nearly 500&#160;h. The resulting semitransparent WBG device delivers a high PCE of 20.06%, and the 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device delivers a PCE of 28.35%.

         <title>Suppressing Element Inhomogeneity Enables 14.9% Efficiency CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is demonstrated to be the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, a remarkable efficiency of 14.9% is achieved, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 576 mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%.








Abstract
Kesterites, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1&#8722;x)4 (CZTSSe), solar cells suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss due to the numerous secondary phases and defects. The prevailing notion attributes this issue to Sn&#8208;loss during the selenization. However, this work unveils that, instead of Sn&#8208;loss, elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. This diffusion decreases the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio to 53% at the bottom fine&#8208;grain layer, increasing the Sn&#8208;/Zn&#8208;related bulk defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, the crystal quality is effectively improved and the defect density is reduced, leading to a remarkable photovoltaic coversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.9% with a VOC of 576&#160;mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%. The findings provide insights into element inhomogeneity, holding significant potential to advance the development of CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Formation of Pt&#8208;Based Intermetallics on MXene with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ti3C2Tx features plentiful surface terminations and abundant oxygen vacancies, which can electrostatically adsorb metal cations and provide channels to induce the interdiffusion of Pt/Fe atoms, synthesizing the ordered PtFe with small particle sizes. The strong metal&#8208;support interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx can induce the charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti and enhance electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The Pt&#8208;based alloys can moderate the binding energies of oxygenated species on the catalytic surface, endowing the superior catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, it is still challenging to explore general methods to synthesize structurally ordered intermetallics with uniform distributions. Herein, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction is employed to facilitate the interdiffusion of Pt/M atoms by establishing a tunnel of oxygen vacancy on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx (MXene) sheets, synthesizing the ordered PtFe, PtCo, PtZn, PdFe, PdZn intermetallics loaded onto Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ generation of Ti&#8211;O from Ti3C2Tx could be bonded with Pt and forming Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti, resulting in charge redistribution through Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ti structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the valuable charge redistribution can be observed at the interface and extended even to at the distance of two nanometers from the interface, which can modulate the Pt&#8211;Pt distance, optimize Pt&#8211;O binding energy and enhance intrinsic activity towards ORR. The strong coupling interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx containing the titanium oxide layer endows the high stability of the composites. This work not only presents a general synthesis strategy for intermetallics but also provides a new insight that metal&#8208;support interaction is essential for the structural evolution of intermetallics on materials with oxygen vacancies.

         <title>Macromers for Encapsulating Perovskite Photovoltaics and Achieving High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macromer PIBA is carefully designed as a UV&#8208;curable adhesive for blanket encapsulating perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SC) without sacrificing the device efficiency. More importantly, the resultant CPIBA&#8208;BE pero&#8208;SCs retain &gt;95% of their initial efficiencies after the damp test (85% relative humidity) for 2000&#160;h.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are highly unstable even under trace water. Although the blanket encapsulation (BE) strategy applied in the industry can effectively block moisture invasion, the commercial UV&#8208;curable adhesives (UVCAs) for BE still trigger power conversion efficiency deterioration, and the degradation mechanism remains unknown. For the first time, the functions of commercial UVCAs are revealed in BE&#8208;processed pero&#8208;SCs, where the small&#8208;sized monomer easily permeates to the perovskite surface, forming an insulating barrier to block charge extraction, while the high&#8208;polarity moiety can destroy perovskite lattice. To solve these problems, a macromer, named PIBA is carefully designed, by grafting two acrylate terminal groups on the highly gastight polyisobutylene and realizes an increased molecular diameter as well as avoided high&#8208;polarity groups.

&lt;p&gt;A macromer PIBA is carefully designed as a UV-curable adhesive for blanket encapsulating perovskite solar cells (pero-SC) without sacrificing the device efficiency. More importantly, the resultant CPIBA-BE pero-SCs retain &amp;gt;95% of their initial efficiencies after the damp test (85% relative humidity) for 2000&#160;h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) are highly unstable even under trace water. Although the blanket encapsulation (BE) strategy applied in the industry can effectively block moisture invasion, the commercial UV-curable adhesives (UVCAs) for BE still trigger power conversion efficiency deterioration, and the degradation mechanism remains unknown. For the first time, the functions of commercial UVCAs are revealed in BE-processed pero-SCs, where the small-sized monomer easily permeates to the perovskite surface, forming an insulating barrier to block charge extraction, while the high-polarity moiety can destroy perovskite lattice. To solve these problems, a macromer, named PIBA is carefully designed, by grafting two acrylate terminal groups on the highly gastight polyisobutylene and realizes an increased molecular diameter as well as avoided high-polarity groups. The PIBA macromer can stabilize on pero-SCs and then sufficiently crosslink, forming a compact and stable network under UV light without sacrificing device performance during the BE process. The resultant BE devices show negligible efficiency loss after storage at 85% relative humidity for 2000&#160;h. More importantly, these devices can even reach ISO 20653:2013 Degrees of protection IPX7 standard when immersed in one-meter-deep water. This BE strategy shows good universality in enhancing the moisture stability of pero-SCs, irrespective of the perovskite composition or device structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal&#8208;Controlled NIR&#8208;II Immune Agonist Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article proposes a strategy to normalize immunotherapy by restoring immune responses within the tumor microenvironment and simultaneously blocking immune checkpoint pathways to prevent tumor cells from evading immune cell recognition. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photothermal response capability of degradable polymers enables localized spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled photothermal therapy and low&#8208;dose drug administration in tumors, enhancing biocompatibility and reducing systemic toxic side effects.








Abstract
The integration of nanomedicine and immunotherapy has presented a promising opportunity for the treatment of cancer and diverse diseases. However, achieving spatiotemporal controllable immunotherapy with excellent efficacy and safety performances remains a significant challenge. This study develops a biodegradable near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal response polymer nanoparticle (PTEQ) system. This platform exhibits intrinsic immunostimulatory properties while concurrently delivering siRNA for Programmed Death&#8208;Ligand 1 (siPD&#8208;L1), leveraging enhanced immune responses and immune checkpoint blockade for safe and effective cancer therapy. In the CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, PTEQ, as an immune stimulant, significantly boosts the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group not only initiates NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy but also promotes the activation and infiltration of T cells, M1 macrophage polarization, and maturation of dendritic cells in the TME, resulting in the complete elimination of tumors in 7/10 cases, achieving a 100% survival rate. In another in vivo vaccine experiment, all tumors on the right side are completely eliminated in the PTEQ/siPD&#8208;L1+laser group, reaching a 100% tumor eradication rate. These findings underscore the potential of this strategy to overcome the current immunotherapeutic limitations and achieve immune therapy normalization.

         <title>Regulating Surface&#8208;Passivator Binding Priority for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between passivator and perovskite is quantitatively assessed to optimize defect passivation. Through modulating adsorption configuration and coordination capacity of the passivator, the intense bonding with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced and leads to enhanced interaction with defects. The near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes without any external light&#8208;coupling achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% and ultralong operational lifetime.








Abstract
Suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative losses through passivators is a prerequisite for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, the complex bonding between passivators and perovskites severely suppresses the passivation process, which still lacks comprehensive understanding. Herein, the number, category, and degree of bonds between different functional groups and the perovskite are quantitatively assessed to study the passivation dynamics. Functional groups with high electrostatic potential and large steric hindrance prioritize strong bonding with organic cations and halides on the perfect surface, leading to suppressed coordination with bulky defects. By modulating the binding priorities and coordination capacity, hindrance from the intense interaction with perfect perovskite is significantly reduced, leading to a more direct passivation process. Consequently, the near&#8208;infrared PeLED without external light out&#8208;coupling demonstrates a record external quantum efficiency of 24.3% at a current density of 42&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, the device exhibits a record&#8208;level&#8208;cycle ON/OFF switching of 20&#160;000 and ultralong half&#8208;lifetime of 1126.3&#160;h under 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the passivators can offer new insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Platinum Nanoparticles Regulated V2C MXene Nanoplatforms with NIR&#8208;II Enhanced Nanozyme Effect for Photothermal and Chemodynamic Anti&#8208;Infective Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a nanoplatform based on Pt NPs anchored on V2C MXene (Pt@V2C), with excellent photothermal enhanced nanozyme strategy. Moreover, Pt@V2C is successfully applied to models of deep&#8208;seated subcutaneous infection and bacterial keratitis, and its therapeutic mechanism is analyzed through transcriptomics, laying the groundwork for the clinical application of V2C MXene with dual agents of photothermal and nanozymes.








Abstract
Given the challenge of multidrug resistance in antibiotics, non&#8208;antibiotic&#8211;dependent antibacterial strategies show promise for anti&#8208;infective therapy. V2C MXene&#8208;based nanomaterials have demonstrated strong biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) for photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the limitation of V2C MXene's laser irradiation to the near&#8208;infrared region I (NIR&#8208;I) restricts tissue penetration, making it difficult to achieve complete bacterial eradication with single&#8208;effect therapeutic strategies. To address this, Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are attached to V2C, forming artificial nanoplatforms (Pt@V2C). Pt@V2C exhibits enhanced PCE (59.6%) and a longer irradiation laser (NIR&#8208;II) due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of Pt NPs and V2C. Notably, Pt@V2C displays dual enzyme&#8208;like activity with chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and NIR&#8208;II enhanced dual enzyme&#8208;like activity. The biocatalytic mechanism of Pt@V2C is elucidated using density functional theory. In an in vivo animal model, Pt@V2C effectively eliminates methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus from deep&#8208;seated tissues in subcutaneous abscesses and bacterial keratitis environments, accelerating abscess resolution and promoting wound and cornea healing through the synergistic effects of PTT/CDT. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that Pt@V2C targets inflammatory pathways, providing insight into its therapeutic mechanism. This study presents a promising therapeutic approach involving hyperthermia&#8208;amplified biocatalysis with Pt NPs and MXene nanocomposites.

         <title>Red Carbon Mediated Formation of Cu2O Clusters Dispersed on the Oxocarbon Framework by Fehling's Route and their Use for the Nitrate Electroreduction in Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, Cu2O clusters are obtained dispersedly on the oxocarbon framework after the Fehling's&#8208;like reaction during the mild annealing process of red carbon, leading to the reduction of Cu (II) predominantly to Cu2O. The covalent oxocarbon framework improves the stability of clusters, enabling their efficient nitrate electroreduction under acidic electrolytes with a high yield rate and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The oligomers of carbon suboxide, known as red carbon, exhibit a highly conjugated structure and semiconducting properties. Upon mild heat treatment, it transforms into a carbonaceous framework rich in oxygen surface terminations, called oxocarbon. In this study, the abundant oxygen functionalities are harnessed as anchors to create oxocarbon&#8208;supported nanohybrid electrocatalysts. Starting with single atomic Cu (II) strongly coordinated to oxygen atoms on red carbon, the Fehling reaction leads to the formation of Cu2O clusters. Simultaneously, a covalent oxocarbon framework emerges via cross&#8208;linking, providing robust support for Cu2O clusters. Notably, the oxocarbon support effectively stabilizes Cu2O clusters of very small size, ensuring their high durability in acidic conditions and the presence of ammonia. The synthesized material exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity for nitrate reduction under acidic electrolyte conditions, with a high yield rate of ammonium (NH4+) at 3.31&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at a potential of &#8722;0.4&#160;V (vs RHE).

&lt;p&gt;Herein, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O clusters are obtained dispersedly on the oxocarbon framework after the Fehling's-like reaction during the mild annealing process of red carbon, leading to the reduction of Cu (II) predominantly to Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The covalent oxocarbon framework improves the stability of clusters, enabling their efficient nitrate electroreduction under acidic electrolytes with a high yield rate and Faradaic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oligomers of carbon suboxide, known as red carbon, exhibit a highly conjugated structure and semiconducting properties. Upon mild heat treatment, it transforms into a carbonaceous framework rich in oxygen surface terminations, called oxocarbon. In this study, the abundant oxygen functionalities are harnessed as anchors to create oxocarbon-supported nanohybrid electrocatalysts. Starting with single atomic Cu (II) strongly coordinated to oxygen atoms on red carbon, the Fehling reaction leads to the formation of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O clusters. Simultaneously, a covalent oxocarbon framework emerges via cross-linking, providing robust support for Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O clusters. Notably, the oxocarbon support effectively stabilizes Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O clusters of very small size, ensuring their high durability in acidic conditions and the presence of ammonia. The synthesized material exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity for nitrate reduction under acidic electrolyte conditions, with a high yield rate of ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) at 3.31&#160;mmol&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at a potential of &#8722;0.4&#160;V (vs RHE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Intracellular Dynamics for Optimized Intracellular Release and Transcytosis Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation into polyglutamine&#8208;paclitaxel conjugates with varying hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios and tertiary amine&#8208;oxide proportions aims (OPGA&#8208;PTX) to optimize an equilibrium between intracellular interception and transcytosis behaviors. OPPX emerges as a superior candidate, demonstrating selective trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis and lysosomal sorting for cathepsin B&#8208;activated drug release, thereby achieving enhanced tumor penetration and efficient antitumor activity.








Abstract
Active transcytosis&#8208;mediated nanomedicine transport presents considerable potential in overcoming diverse delivery barriers, thereby facilitating tumor accumulation and penetration. Nevertheless, the persistent challenge lies in achieving a nuanced equilibrium between intracellular interception for drug release and transcytosis for tumor penetration. In this study, a comprehensive exploration is conducted involving a series of polyglutamine&#8208;paclitaxel conjugates featuring distinct hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios (HHR) and tertiary amine&#8208;oxide proportions (TP) (OPGA&#8208;PTX). The screening process, meticulously focused on delineating their subcellular distribution, transcytosis capability, and tumor penetration, unveils a particularly promising candidate denoted as OPPX, characterized by an HHR of 10:1 and a TP of 100%. OPPX, distinguished by its rapid cellular internalization through multiple endocytic pathways, selectively engages in trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis to facilitate accumulation within and penetration throughout tumor tissues and simultaneously sorted to lysosomes for cathepsin B&#8208;activated drug release. This study not only identifies OPPX as an exemplary nanomedicine but also underscores the feasibility of modulating subcellular distribution to optimize the active transport capabilities and intracellular release mechanisms of nanomedicines, providing an alternative approach to designing efficient anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Sequentially Processed Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction&#8208;Buried Structure for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with 500&#160;nm Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;heterojunction is buried into layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structures to realize decent vertical phase distribution and sufficient exciton dissociation interfaces simultaneously. This scheme possesses efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% in organic solar cells with 500&#8208;nm&#8208;thick active layers.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area printing fabrication is a distinctive feature of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the advance of upscalable fabrication is challenged by the thickness of organic active layers considering the importance of both exciton dissociation and charge collection. In this work, a bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;buried (buried&#8208;BHJ) structure is introduced by sequential deposition to realize efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, thereby contributing to efficient OSCs with 500&#160;nm thick active layers. The buried&#8208;BHJ distributes donor and acceptor phases in the vertical direction as charge transport channels, while numerous BHJ interfaces are buried in each phase to facilitate exciton dissociation simultaneously. It is found that buried&#8208;BHJ configurations possess efficient exciton dissociation and rapid charge transport, resulting in reduced recombination losses. In comparison with traditional structures, the buried&#8208;BHJ structure displays a decent tolerance to film thickness. In particular, a power conversion efficiency of 16.0% is achieved with active layers at a thickness of 500&#160;nm. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this represents the champion efficiency of thick film OSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalyst via Spin Manipulation for Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implanting Fe atomic clusters on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C matrix is achieved by a developed pyrolyzing method of double&#8208;ligand zinc&#8208;based zeolite framework. Spin&#8208;state of Fe single atoms verified from low spin (LS, t2g6 eg0) to medium spin (MS, t2g5 eg1) enables boosting the reaction kinetics of the rate&#8208;determining step, which finally leads to advanced oxygen reduction reaction activities and Zn&#8211;air batteries performance.








Abstract
The interaction between oxygen species and metal sites of various orbitals exhibits intimate correlation with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, a new approach for boosting the inherent ORR activity of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C matrix is represented by implanting Fe&#160;atomic clusters nearby. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst delivers excellent ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.78 and 0.90&#160;V in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The decent ORR activity can also be validated from the high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery. The experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron spin&#8208;state of monodispersed Fe active sites is transferred from the low spin (LS, t2g6 eg0) to the medium spin (MS, t2g5 eg1) due to the involvement of Fe atomic clusters, leading to the spin electron filling in &#963;&#8727; orbit, by which it favors OH&#8722; desorption and in turn boosts the reaction kinetics of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work paves a solid way for rational design of high&#8208;performance Fe&#8208;based single atom catalysts through spin manipulation.

         <title>Dendronized Polymer&#8208;Derived Nanomedicines for Mitochondrial Dynamics Regulation and Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative dendronized polymer&#8208;derived nanomedicine for breast cancer treatment. Dendron(G2)&#8208;dendronized polymeric conjugate effectively targets tumors to release chemotherapeutic agents, and actively modulates mitochondrial dynamics. This modulation promotes mitochondrial fusion and enhances MHC&#8208;1 antigen presentation, which aids in the activation of cytotoxic T cells, providing a potent, synergistic approach with PD&#8208;1 inhibitor to effectively combat tumors.








Abstract
The effects of dendron side chains in polymeric conjugates on tumor penetration and antigen presentation are systematically examined. Three polymer&#8208;gemcitabine (Gem) conjugates (pG0&#8208;Gem, pG1&#8208;Gem, pG2&#8208;Gem) are designed and prepared. The pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate uniquely binds to the mitochondria of tumor cells, thus regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The interaction between the pG2&#8208;Gem conjugate and the mitochondria promotes great penetration and accumulation of the conjugate at the tumor site, resulting in pronounced antitumor effects in an animal model. Such encouraging therapeutic effects can be ascribed to immune modulation since MHC&#8208;1 antigen presentation is significantly enhanced due to mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial metabolism alteration after pG2&#8208;Gem treatment. Crucially, the drug&#8208;free dendronized polymer, pG2, is identified to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and the regulation is independent of the conjugated Gem. Furthermore, the combination of pG2&#8208;Gem with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in a remarkable tumor clearance rate of 87.5% and a prolonged survival rate of over 150 days, demonstrating the potential of dendronized polymers as an innovative nanoplatform for metabolic modulation and synergistic tumor immunotherapy.

Furthermore, the combination of pG2-Gem with anti-PD-1 antibody results in a remarkable tumor clearance rate of 87.5% and a prolonged survival rate of over 150 days, demonstrating the potential of dendronized polymers as an innovative nanoplatform for metabolic modulation and synergistic tumor immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Highly Active Single Atom Configurations for Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward approach to stabilize (and activate) platinum single atoms (Pt SAs) on TiO2 surfaces is shown. Through the optimization of post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments, few&#8208;atom Pt assemblies that are resistant to agglomeration are successfully formed and exhibited significantly enhanced hydrogen production efficiency.








Abstract
The employment of single atoms (SAs), especially Pt SAs, as co&#8208;catalysts in photocatalytic H2 generation has gained significant attention due to their exceptional efficiency. However, a major challenge in their application is the light&#8208;induced agglomeration of these SAs into less active nanosized particles under photocatalytic conditions. This study addresses the stability and reactivity of Pt SAs on TiO2 surfaces by investigating various post&#8208;deposition annealing treatments in air, Ar, and Ar&#8208;H2 environments at different temperatures. It is described that annealing in an Ar&#8208;H2 atmosphere optimally stabilizes SA configurations, forming stable 2D rafts of assembled SAs &#8776;0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm in diameter. These rafts not only resist light&#8208;induced agglomeration but also exhibit significantly enhanced H2 production efficiency. The findings reveal a promising approach to maintaining the high reactivity of Pt SAs while overcoming the critical challenge of their stability under photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Strong Plasticization for High&#8208;Performance Alginate Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a facile processing method to fabricate natural polysaccharide plastics as convenient as a thermoforming process. Polysaccharide plastics are processed in a near&#8208;solid state by hydrogen bond mediation, realizing sufficient stretching that improves chain alignment. Highly orientated and crystalline alginate films exhibit high mechanical performance comparable to synthetic films. High&#8208;performance alginate plastics with desired functionalities are also constructed.








Abstract
The increasingly severe plastic pollution has urged an inevitable trend to develop biodegradable plastic products that can take over synthetic plastics. As one of the most abundant natural polymers, polysaccharides are an ideal candidate to substitute synthetic plastics. The rigidity of polysaccharide chains principally allows for high strength and stiffness of their materials, however, challenges the facile orientation in material processing. Here, a general hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticization strategy to regulate isotropic sodium alginate (SA) chains to a highly ordered state is developed, and alginate plastics with high performances are fabricated. It is revealed that hydroxyl groups in glycerol modulate the viscoelasticity of SA solids by forming strong hydrogen bonds with SA chains, achieving a large stretchability at a high solid content. Highly orientated alginate films exhibit a superior tensile strength of 575&#160;MPa and toughness of 60.7&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, outperforming most regenerated biomass films. The high solid content and large stretchability mediated by strong hydrogen bonding ensure plastic molding of solid&#8208;like SA with high fidelity. This hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticity provides a facile but effective method to justify the high performances of polysaccharide&#8208;based plastics.

         <title>The Potential Regulation of Working Anode for Long&#8208;Term Zero&#8208;Volt Storage at 37&#160;&#176;C in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at 37&#160;&#176;C is achieved through quantitative regulation of anode potential in working cells. This approach prevents Cu current collector dissolution and SEI degradation by controlling the Li6CoO4 content in cathode, with reversible capacity in slight over&#8208;lithiation LCO demonstrated. This paves the way for emerging applications in active implantable medical devices.








Abstract
The advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries that can tolerate zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) are in high demand for implantable medical devices and spacecraft. However, ZVS can raise the anode potential, leading to Cu current collector dissolution and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation, especially at 37&#160;&#176;C. In this contribution, by quantitatively regulating the dosage of Li6CoO4 cathode additives, controllable potential of the working anode under abusive&#8208;discharge conditions is demonstrated. The addition of Li6CoO4 keeps zero&#8208;crossing potential (ZCP) and the potential of ZVS below 2.0 V (vs Li/Li+) for LiCoO2|mesocarbon microbead cells at 37&#160;&#176;C. The capacity retention ratio (CRR) increases from 69.1% and 35.9% to 98.6% and 90.8% after 10 and 20 days of ZVS, respectively. The Cu dissolution and SEI degradation are effectively suppressed, while the over&#8208;lithiated cathode exhibits high reversible capacity after ZVS. The limiting conditions of long&#8208;term ZVS are further explored and a corresponding guide map is designed. When quantitatively regulating ZCP and the potential in ZVS, Cu dissolution, SEI degradation, and irreversible conversion of the cathode constitute the limiting conditions. This contribution designs the most reasonable potential range for ZVS protection at 37&#160;&#176;C, and realizes the best CRR record through precise potential regulation for the first time.

         <title>Photothermal Mineralization of Polyolefin Microplastics via TiO2 Hierarchical Porous Layer&#8208;Based Semiwetting Air&#8208;Plastic&#8208;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase system based on a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) is established. It boosts the photoexcitation and transfer of charge carriers and the interfacial diffusion of gaseous oxygen, greatly improving low&#8208;density polyethylene photothermal mineralization relative to a conventional diphase system. Investigations into micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano level wettability at air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces help unravel the interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction process.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;mineralization of microplastics under mild conditions has emerged as a promising solution to plastic waste disposal. However, the inadequate contact between oxygen, water&#8208;insoluble polyolefin microplastics, and photocatalysts remains a critical issue. In this study, a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) photocatalyst is presented to establish air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase interfaces for the photothermal mineralization of polyolefins. The wettability of the TiO2&#8208;HPL&#8208;based triphase interface is finely controlled from plastophobic to plastophilic. High&#8208;resolution imaging and finite element simulation demonstrate the significance of a semiwetting state in achieving multidirectional oxygen diffusion through the hierarchical pore structure while maintaining sufficient contact between the plastic phase and photocatalysts. For low&#8208;density polyethylene, the TiO2&#8208;HPL achieves a photothermal mineralization rate of 5.63 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a conversion of 26.3% after 20 h of continuous irradiation. Additionally, the triphase photocatalytic system with semiwetting gas&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces shows good universality for various polyolefin reagents and products, illustrating its potential in achieving efficient photothermal mineralization of non&#8208;degradable microplastics.

         <title>Designer Lithium Reservoirs for Ultralong Life Lithium Batteries for Grid Storage</title>

Enabled by the unique mediation chemistry of elemental sulfur, the designer lithium reservoirs possess controllable electrochemical activities and high specific capacity without evolution of any reactive gases, which contribute to an outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity.








Abstract
The minimization of irreversible active lithium loss stands as a pivotal concern in rechargeable lithium batteries, particularly in the context of grid&#8208;storage applications, where achieving the utmost energy density over prolonged cycling is imperative to meet stringent demands, notably in terms of life cost. Departing from conventional methodologies advocating electrode prelithiation and/or electrolyte additives, a new paradigm is proposed here: the integration of a designer lithium reservoir (DLR) featuring lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) and elemental sulfur. This approach concurrently addresses active lithium consumption through solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and mitigates minor yet continuous parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface during extended cycling. The remarkable synergy between the Li&#8208;ion conductive Li4SiO4 and the SEI&#8208;favorable elemental sulfur enables customizable compensation kinetics for active lithium loss throughout continuous cycling. The introduction of a minute quantity of DLR (3 wt% Li4SiO4@S) yields outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell (graphite||LiFePO4) with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity (&#8776;2.3 Ah), demonstrating remarkable capacity retention (&#8776;95%) even after 3000 cycles. This utilization of a DLR is poised to expedite the development of enduring lithium batteries for grid&#8208;storage applications and stimulate the design of practical, implantable rechargeable batteries based on related cell chemistries.

         <title>Exosome&#8208;Inhibiting Polymeric Sonosensitizer for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) is designed for combination sono&#8208;immunotherapy, triggering tumor immunogenic cell death under ultrasound irradiation and inhibiting tumor exosome generation upon activation by tumor biomarker.








Abstract
Combination cancer immunotherapy based on electromagnetic energy and immunotherapy shows potent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy. However, as a factor that mediates tumor metastasis and immune suppression, the impact of tumor exosomes on therapy under electromagnetic energy stimulation remains unclear. Herein, findings indicate that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) increases serum exosome levels by inducing apoptotic exosomes and loosening the tumor extracellular matrix, promoting lung metastasis. To address this problem, an exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) selectively inhibiting tumor exosome generation in response to the tumor biomarker is synthesized. EIPS consists of a semiconducting polymer backbone capable of inducing SDT and a poly(ethylene glycol) layer conjugated with a tumor&#8208;specific enzyme&#8208;responsive exosome inhibitor prodrug. After being cleaved by tumor Cathepsin B, EIPS releases active exosome inhibitors, preventing tumor exosome&#8208;mediated immune suppression and lung metastasis. As a result, EIPS elicits robust antitumor effects through the synergistic effect of SDT and tumor exosome inhibition, completely preventing lung metastasis and establishing a long&#8208;term immune memory effect. This is the first example showing that combining SDT with tumor&#8208;specific exosome inhibition can elicit a potent immune response without the help of typical immune agonists.

         <title>Electronic Spin Alignment within Homologous NiS2/NiSe2 Heterostructures to Promote Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 interphase promotes spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin, thereby generating additional unpaired electrons. This high electronic spin configuration promotes the electrocatalytic polysulfide redox reaction within Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The catalytic activation of the Li&#8208;S reaction is fundamental to maximize the capacity and stability of Li&#8208;S batteries (LSBs). Current research on Li&#8208;S catalysts mainly focuses on optimizing the energy levels to promote adsorption and catalytic conversion, while frequently overlooking the electronic spin state influence on charge transfer and orbital interactions. Here, hollow NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures encapsulated in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (NiS2/NiSe2@NC) are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive in sulfur cathodes. The NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructure promotes the spin splitting of the 3d orbital, driving the Ni3+ transformation from low to high spin. This high spin configuration raises the electronic energy level and activates the electronic state. This&#160;accelerates the charge transfer and optimizes the adsorption energy, lowering the reaction energy barrier of the polysulfides&#160;conversion. Benefiting from these characteristics, LSBs based on NiS2/NiSe2@NC/S cathodes exhibit high initial capacity (1458 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (572 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 at 5C), and stable cycling with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.025% per cycle at 1C during 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loadings (6.2 mg&#183;cm&#8315;2), high initial capacities of 1173 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 (7.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2) are measured at 0.1C, and 1058 mAh&#183;g&#8315;1 is retained after 300 cycles.

         <title>Photochemical Design for Diverse Controllable Patterns in Self&#8208;Wrinkling Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy to constructing arbitrary on&#8208;demand self&#8208;wrinkle patterns on polyurethane elastomers via spatiotemporal photochemistry boundaries is developed. This technology allows for the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly 2D ordered to periodic or intricate designs, providing a versatile basis for applications in anticounterfeiting devices, dynamic light grating, and functional systems.








Abstract
Harnessing the spontaneous surface instability of pliable substances to create intricate, well&#8208;ordered, and on&#8208;demand controlled surface patterns holds great potential for advancing applications in optical, electrical, and biological processes. However, the current limitations stem from challenges in modulating multidirectional stress fields and diverse boundary environments. Herein, this work proposes a universal strategy to achieve arbitrarily controllable wrinkle patterns via the spatiotemporal photochemical boundaries. Utilizing constraints and inductive effects of the photochemical boundaries, the multiple coupling relationship is accomplished among the light fields, stress fields, and morphology of wrinkles in photosensitive polyurethane (PSPU) film. Moreover, employing sequential light&#8208;irradiation with photomask enables the attainment of a diverse array of controllable patterns, ranging from highly ordered 2D patterns to periodic or intricate designs. The fundamental mechanics of underlying buckling and the formation of surface features are comprehensively elucidated through theoretical stimulation and finite element analysis. The results reveal the evolution laws of wrinkles under photochemical boundaries and represent a new effective toolkit for fabricating intricate and captivating patterns in single&#8208;layer films.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Oxidation&#8208;Reduction of Iodide Ions for Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI) is incorporated into perovskite as an additive to inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, which provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I2 under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine&#8208;induced degradations. Under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions, the device with ESAI retained 97% of the original power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300 h.








Abstract
Despite rapid advancements in the photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their operational stability remains a significant challenge for commercialization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite rapid advancements in the photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their operational stability remains a significant challenge for commercialization. This instability mainly arises from light-induced halide ion migration and subsequent oxidation into iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The situation is exacerbated when considering the heat effects at elevated temperatures, leading to the volatilization of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and resulting in irreversible device degradation. Mercaptoethylammonium iodide (ESAI) is thus incorporated into perovskite as an additive to inhibit the oxidation of iodide anion (I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and &#160;the light-induced degradation pathway of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;FAI+PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the formation of a thiol-disulfide/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox pair within the perovskite film provides a dynamic mechanism for the continuous reduction of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under light and thermal stresses, facilitating the healing of iodine-induced degradations. This approach significantly enhances the operational stability of PSCs.

         <title>Tunnel&#8208;Oriented VO2 (B) Cathode for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional ion diffusion in the VO2 (B) cathode is achieved by manipulating exposed crystal facet and morphology. The dispersive (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts tend to spread flatly to form directional and fast ion transport alone the tunnels in the c&#8208;axis. Such a feature ensures the ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance, surpassing that of aggregated samples with random arrangement.








Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxides are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, unlike layer&#8208;type cathodes with adjustable layer distances, enhancing ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnels characterized by fixed sizes poses a considerable challenge. This study highlights that the macroscopic arrangement of the electrode crucially determines tunnel orientation, thereby influencing ion transport. By changing the material morphology, the tunnel orientation can be optimized to facilitate rapid ion diffusion. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, it is revealed that (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts with dispersive morphology (VO2&#8208;D) tend to adopt a stacking pattern with directional ion transport along the c&#8208;axis on the electrode and guarantee fast ion diffusion. Compared with the aggregated sample (VO2&#8208;A) that tends to random arrangement on the electrode with isotropic and slow ion transfer behavior, the electrode featuring dispersive (00l) facets&#8208;dominated VO2 (B) nanobelts displays directional and fast ion diffusion behavior, thus exhibits an ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (420.8 and 344.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 10 A g&#8722;1, respectively) and long cycling stability (84.3% capacity retention under 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). The results suggest that simultaneous manipulation of exposed crystal facet and morphology&#8208;related electrode arrangement should be promising for boosting the ion&#8208;transport kinetics in tunnel&#8208;type vanadium oxide cathodes.

         <title>Optically Tunable Electrical Oscillations in Oxide&#8208;Based Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports light&#8208;control of an oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillator based on the photothermal response of V3O5, a material that undergoes an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition at temperatures above &#8776;420 K.&#160; The research advances the understanding of V3O5 as a functional material, and demonstrates its potential as the basis of a solid&#8208;state sensory neuron for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The application of hardware&#8208;based neural networks can be enhanced by integrating sensory neurons and synapses that enable direct input from external stimuli. This work reports direct optical control of an oscillatory neuron based on volatile threshold switching in V3O5. The devices exhibit electroforming&#8208;free operation with switching parameters that can be tuned by optical illumination. Using temperature&#8208;dependent electrical measurements, conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), in situ thermal imaging, and lumped element modelling, it is shown that the changes in switching parameters, including threshold and hold voltages, arise from overall conductivity increase of the oxide film due to the contribution of both photoconductive and bolometric characteristics of V3O5, which eventually affects the oscillation dynamics. Furthermore, V3O5 is identified as a new bolometric material with a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as high as &#8722;4.6% K&#8722;1 at 423 K. The utility of these devices&#160;is illustrated by demonstrating in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing with reduced computational effort and an optical encoding layer for spiking neural network (SNN), respectively, using a simulated array of devices.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale, Stretchable, Self&#8208;Protective, and Multifunctional Perovskite Luminescent Filament with Ultra&#8208;High Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
The CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite luminescent filament (PLF) with high stretchability, large scalability, and high luminescence is obtained by wet spinning via a fast solvent extraction. The CsPbBr3 PLF displayed prominent stability in air, water, moisture, heat, etc. The CsPbX3 PLF demonstrates significant potential in organic dyes and strain sensing, flexible displays, secondary anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and hazard warning systems.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites possess great application potential in flexible displays and wearable optoelectronics owing to their prominent optoelectronic properties. However, the intrinsic instability upon moisture, heat, and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation hinders their development and application. In this work, an ultra&#8208;stable CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite luminescent filament (PLF) with high stretchability (&#8776;2400%) and luminescence performance (photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.5%, tunable emission spectrum, and high color purity) is introduced by a facile environmental&#8208;friendly wet&#8208;spinning technology via solvent extraction. Benefiting from the in situ encapsulation of the hydrophobic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and the chelation of Lewis base CO in TPU with Lewis acid Pb2+, the CsPbBr3 PLF demonstrates ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence (PL) stability when stored in ambient air and high humidity circumstance, annealed at 50 &#176;C, and dipped in water for 30 days, illuminated under ultraviolet light for 300 min, and immersed in organic solvents and solutions with pH of 1&#8208;13 for 5 min, respectively. Impressively, it retains 80% of its initial PL after being recycled five times. Overall, the CsPbX3 PLF demonstrates promising prospects in multifunctional applications, including organic dyes and tensile strain sensing, flexible pattern displays, secondary anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and hazard warning systems.

In addition, a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided.

Abstract
Mixed conducting materials with both ionic and electronic conductivities have gained prominence in emerging applications. However, exploring material with on&#8208;demand ionic and electronic conductivities remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of correlating macroscopic conductivity with atom&#8208;scale structure. Here, the correlation of proton&#8211;electron conductivity and atom&#8208;scale structure in graphdiyne is explored. Precisely adjusting the conjugated diynes and oxygenic functional groups in graphdiyne yields a tunable proton&#8211;electron conductivity on the order of 103. In addition, a wet&#8208;chemistry lithography technique for uniform preparation of graphdiyne on flexible substrates is provided. Utilizing the proton&#8211;electron conductivity and mechanical tolerance of graphdiyne, bimodal flexible devices serving as capacitive switches and resistive sensors are created. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a breath&#8211;machine interface for sentence&#8208;based communication and self&#8208;nursing tasks with an accuracy of 98% is designed. This work represents an important step toward understanding the atom&#8208;scale structure&#8211;conductivity relationship and extending the applications of mixed conducting materials to assistive technology.

A memristive explainable artificial intelligence (MemXAI) hardware is proposed to provide an explanation and interpretation of AI decisions, where the three essential functions are implemented using three different types of memristors. The MemXAI hardware promotes a trustworthy AI system with low energy consumption of only 4.32% compared to conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based computing systems.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is often considered a black box because it provides optimal answers without clear insight into its decision&#8208;making process. To address this black box problem, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged, which provides an explanation and interpretation of its decisions, thereby promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems. Here, a memristive XAI hardware framework is presented. This framework incorporates three distinct types of memristors (Mott memristor, valence change memristor, and charge trap memristor), each responsible for performing three essential functions (perturbation, analog multiplication, and integration) required for the XAI hardware implementation. Three memristor arrays with high robustness are fabricated and the image recognition of 3 &#215; 3 testing patterns and their explanation map generation are experimentally demonstrated. Then, a software&#8208;based extended system based on the characteristics of this hardware is built, simulating a large&#8208;scale image recognition task. The proposed system can perform the XAI operations with only 4.32% of the energy compared to conventional digital systems, enlightening its strong potential for the XAI accelerator.

         <title>Bipolaronic Motifs Induced Spatially Separated Catalytic Sites for Tunable Syngas Photosynthesis From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolaronic Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are custom&#8208;designed into an imine&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework, resulting in an efficient reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Such featured structures show efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3) and can achieve a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to tackle the energy and environmental challenges; however, it remains a challenge to achieve reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Therefore, efficient production of syngas with a suitable CO/H2 ratio for Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis can hardly be achieved. Herein, bipolaronic motifs including Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are rationally designed into a crystalline imine&#8208;linked 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF) with a triazine core. These featured structures with spatially separated active sites exhibit efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3). The bipolaronic motifs enable a highly separated electron&#8211;hole state, whereby the Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs tend to be the active sites for CO2 activation and accelerate the hydrogenation to form *COOH intermediates; whilst, the Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs increase surface hydrophilicity for H2 evolution. The photocatalytic reductions of CO2 and H2O thus decouple and proceed via a concerted way on the bipolaronic motifs of bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF. The optimal bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF photocatalyst achieves a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with CO/H2 ratio of 1:2, outperforming previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanoparticle (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interaction between cyclodextrin protected&#8208;gold nanocluster and adamantane modified CO donor is developed for the combination of gas therapy and radio therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells and excellent inhibition of glycolysis for efficient radiotherapy against cancer.








Abstract
Glycolysis&#8208;dominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells can promote their therapeutic resistance against radiotherapy (RT). Carbon monoxide (CO) as a glycolysis inhibitor can enhance the efficiency of RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive CO&#8208;releasing nanocomposite (HA@AuNC@CO) based on strong host&#8211;guest interactions between the radiosensitizer and CO donor for enhanced RT is developed. The encapsulated gold nanoclusters (CD&#8208;AuNCs) can effectively generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X&#8208;ray radiation, which not only directly inactivate cancer cells but also induce in situ CO gas generation from adamantane modified metal carbonyl (Ada&#8208;CO) for glycolysis inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that HA@AuNC@CO exhibits active targeting toward CD44 overexpressed cancer cells, along with excellent inhibition of glycolysis and efficient RT against cancer. This study offers a new strategy for the combination of gas therapy and RT in tumor treatment.

         <title>Atomic Pt Sites Anchored in the Interface between Grains on Vacancy&#8208;Enriched CeO2 Nanosheets: One&#8208;Step Precursor Combustion Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy for developing atomic Pt catalysts is proposed, which results in the atomic Pt sites anchored in the interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. Thereinto, the atomic Pt sites with the low valence state in the CeO2 interface can improve the low&#8208;temperature activity for a three&#8208;way catalyst.








Abstract
Atomic metal catalysts have unique electronic, structural, and catalytic properties, which are widely used in the field of catalysis. However, designing new simple synthesis methods to fabricate atomic metal catalysts is a challenge in catalytic applications. Herein, a one&#8208;step precursor combustion strategy is presented that starts directly from precursors of metal salts, using a spontaneous combustion process convert platinum nitrate to atomic Pt sites. The atomic Pt sites with low valence are anchored in the formed interface between grains on vacancy&#8208;enriched CeO2 nanosheets. The obtained Pt/CeO2&#8208;2 catalyst exhibits much higher three&#8208;way catalytic activities at low temperatures than Pt/CeO2&#8208;C catalysts prepared using the traditional impregnation method. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated lower valent Pt atoms in the CeO2 interface promote catalytic activity through reducing the energy barrier, and lead to an overall improvement of three&#8208;way catalytic activities. This facile strategy provides new insights into the study of the properties and applications of atomic noble metal catalysts.

Thereinto, the atomic Pt sites with the low valence state in the CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface can improve the low-temperature activity for a three-way catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic metal catalysts have unique electronic, structural, and catalytic properties, which are widely used in the field of catalysis. However, designing new simple synthesis methods to fabricate atomic metal catalysts is a challenge in catalytic applications. Herein, a one-step precursor combustion strategy is presented that starts directly from precursors of metal salts, using a spontaneous combustion process convert platinum nitrate to atomic Pt sites. The atomic Pt sites with low valence are anchored in the formed interface between grains on vacancy-enriched CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. The obtained Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-2 catalyst exhibits much higher three-way catalytic activities at low temperatures than Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C catalysts prepared using the traditional impregnation method. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated lower valent Pt atoms in the CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface promote catalytic activity through reducing the energy barrier, and lead to an overall improvement of three-way catalytic activities. This facile strategy provides new insights into the study of the properties and applications of atomic noble metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The polymer optical fiber based on the temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence of NaLaTi2O6:Yb/Er phosphors is inserted into a pouch&#8208;type battery, and the continuous temperature variations are instantly obtained to deduce the immediate internal circumstances.&#160;The real&#8208;time and in situ thermal evolution inside the battery can be stably transmitted by the optical fiber without hindering the normal operation. 








Abstract
Thermal characteristics are essential for improving the performance and monitoring the status of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is a challenge to design efficient and facile sensing materials for the detection of the in situ temperature of a working LIB. Herein, a ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber is developed and real&#8208;time temperature monitoring is performed with a measurement accuracy of 0.12&#160;&#176;C, and the feasibility based on this polymer optical fiber composed of NaLaTi2O6:Yb/Er phosphors is verified in a pouch&#8208;type battery. During the charging and discharging cycles, the in situ temperature is instantaneously conveyed, revealing the internal situation of LIBs. This article further dwells on the thermal characteristics in constant current (CC)/constant voltage charging and CC discharging processes at different C&#8208;rates and the battery failure when operated at low temperatures (0&#160;&#176;C). This work demonstrates an innovative strategy for operando solitary temperature monitoring conducted by ratiometric fluorescence optical fiber.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired All&#8208;Natural Biogel for Bioadhesive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor in the skin, a straightforward yet versatile approach for fabricating highly ductile, ionically conductive, long&#8208;term stable, and fully degradable all&#8208;natural gelatin&#8208;based biogel is presented. The developed biogel holds promise for constructing reliable bio&#8208;interfaces for electrophysiological signal recording, offering high signal fidelity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Natural material&#8208;based hydrogels are considered ideal candidates for constructing robust bio&#8208;interfaces due to their environmentally sustainable nature and biocompatibility. However, these hydrogels often encounter limitations such as weak mechanical strength, low water resistance, and poor ionic conductivity. Here, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in skin, a straightforward yet versatile strategy is proposed for fabricating all&#8208;natural ionic biogels that exhibit high resilience, ionic conductivity, resistance to dehydration, and complete degradability, without necessitating any chemical modification. A well&#8208;balanced combination of gelatin and sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (an NMF compound) gives rise to a significant enhancement in the mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capacity of the biogel compared to pure gelatin hydrogel. The biogel manifests temperature&#8208;controlled reversible fluid&#8208;gel transition properties attributed to the triple&#8208;helix junctions of gelatin, which enables in situ gelation on diverse substrates, thereby ensuring conformal contact and dynamic compliance with curved surfaces. Due to its salutary properties, the biogel can serve as an effective and biocompatible interface for high&#8208;quality and long&#8208;term electrophysiological signal recording. These findings provide a general and scalable approach for designing natural material&#8208;based hydrogels with tailored functionalities to meet diverse application needs.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel&#8208;Functionalized Photothermal Sponge Enables Simultaneously Continuous Solar Desalination and Electricity Generation Without Salt Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional solar evaporator is developed by designing polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits a water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but also can uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in brine over a prolonged period under one sun.








Abstract
Technologies that can simultaneously generate electricity and desalinate seawater are highly attractive and required to meet the increasing global demand for power and clean water. Here, a bifunctional solar evaporator that features continuous electric generation in seawater without salt accumulation is developed by rational design of polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits an unprecedentedly high water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1along with 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but can also uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in high&#8208;concentration brine over a prolonged period under one sun irradiation. Many common electronic devices can be driven by simply connecting evaporator units in series or in parallel without any other auxiliaries. Different from the previously proposed power generation mechanism, this study reveals that the water&#8208;enabled proton concentration fields in intermediate water region can also induce an additional ion electric field in free water region containing solute, to further enhance electricity output. Given the low&#8208;cost materials, simple self&#8208;regeneration design, scalable fabrication processes, and stable performance, this work offers a promising strategy for addressing the shortages of clean water and sustainable electricity.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Co&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate to Urea with High Faradaic Efficiency on Cobalt&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>

         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) act as a highselective electrocatalyst for urea production by C&#8211;N coupling, offering a large urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency of 54.3%.

Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co&#8208;reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on&#8208;site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large&#8208;scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C&#8211;N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) are proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C&#8211;N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea&#8208;producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1, much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactant diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces&#8208;electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high&#8208;rate formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis.

         <title>Stabilizing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Liquid Metal Via Dynamic Hydrogel&#8208;Derived Carbon Framework Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to encapsulate EGaIn within a hierarchically porous carbon network derived from a hydrogel matrix, which not only buffers the volume change and promotes the reaction kinetics but also reduces the side&#8208;reactions caused by the spontaneous oxidation of LM and decomposition of the SEI, is developed.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium liquid metal (EGaIn&#8208;LM), with a considerable capacity and unique self&#8208;healing properties derived from its intrinsic liquid nature, gains tremendous attention for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anode. However, the fluidity of the LM can trigger continuous consumption of the electrolyte, and its liquid&#8211;solid transition during the lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation process may result in the rupture of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, LM is employed as an initiator to in situ assemble the 3D hydrogel for dynamically encapsulating itself; the LM nanoparticles can be homogeneously confined within the hydrogel&#8208;derived carbon framework (HDC) after calcination. Such design effectively alleviates the volume expansion of LM and facilitates electron transportation, resulting in a superior rate capability and long&#8208;term cyclability. Further, the &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; SEI structure and its key components, including the robust LiF outer layer and corrosion&#8208;resistant and ionic conductive LiGaOx inner layer are revealed, confirming the involvement of LM in the formation of SEI, as well as the important role of carbon framework in reducing interfacial side reactions and SEI decomposition. This work provides a distinct perspective for the formation, structural evolution, and composition of SEI at the liquid/solid interface, and demonstrates an effective strategy to construct a reliable matrix for stabilizing the SEI.

         <title>Dendritic Polymer&#8208;Based Nanomedicines Remodel the Tumor Stroma: Improve Drug Penetration and Enhance Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic polymer&#8208;based nanomedicines are constructed for sequential delivery of dasatinib (DAS) and epirubicin (Epi). DAS&#8208;containing nanomedicine&#160;regulates collagen anabolism and energy metabolism of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) for extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, thus facilitating the deep penetration of Epi&#8208;containing nanomedicine to potentiate immunogenic cell death. This sequential treatment strategy evokes robust antitumor immune responses to suppress breast cancer progression and metastasis.








Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM)&#160;in&#160;solid&#160;tumors, contributed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), hinders penetration of drugs and diminishes their therapeutic outcomes. A sequential treatment strategy of remodeling the ECM via a CAF modifier (dasatinib, DAS) is proposed to promote penetration of an immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (epirubicin, Epi) via apoptotic vesicles, ultimately enhancing the treatment efficacy against breast cancer. Dendritic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA)&#8208;based nanomedicines (poly[OEGMA&#8208;Dendron(G2)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly&#8208;DAS] (P&#8208;DAS) and poly[OEGMA&#8208;Dendron(G2)&#8208;hydrazone&#8208;Epi] (P&#8208;Epi)) are developed for sequential delivery of DAS and Epi, respectively. P&#8208;DAS reprograms CAFs to reduce collagen by downregulating collagen anabolism and energy metabolism, thereby reducing the ECM deposition. The regulated ECM can enhance tumor penetration of P&#8208;Epi to strengthen its ICD effect, leading to an amplified antitumor immune response. In breast cancer&#8208;bearing mice, this approach alleviates the ECM barrier, resulting in reduced tumor burden and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and more encouragingly, synergizes effectively with anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1) therapy, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and preventing lung metastasis. Furthermore, systemic toxicity is barely detectable after sequential treatment with P&#8208;DAS and P&#8208;Epi. This approach opens a new avenue for treating desmoplastic tumors by metabolically targeting CAFs to overcome the ECM barrier.

         <title>2D Air&#8208;Stable Nonlayered Ferrimagnetic FeCr2S4 Crystals Synthesized via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful synthesis of highly crystalline 2D FeCr2S4 in 2D form with pure cubic spinel structure, which exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, thickness independent of TC and excellent air stability. The work promotes further exploration of the fundamental aspects of 2D magnets, and paves the way for the application of the 2D robust ferrimagnetic material in multiferroic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
The discovery of intrinsic 2D magnetic materials has opened up new opportunities for exploring magnetic properties at atomic layer thicknesses, presenting potential applications in spintronic devices. Here a new 2D ferrimagnetic crystal of nonlayered FeCr2S4 is synthesized with high phase purity using chemical vapor deposition. The obtained 2D FeCr2S4 exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, as evidenced by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane/in&#8208;plane Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance. Theoretical calculations further elucidate that the observed magnetic anisotropy can be attributed to its surface termination structure. By combining temperature&#8208;dependent magneto&#8208;transport and polarized Raman spectroscopy characterizations, it is discovered that both the measured Curie temperature and the critical temperature at which a low energy magnon peak disappeared remains constant, regardless of its thickness. Magnetic force microscopy measurements show the flipping process of magnetic domains. The exceptional air&#8208;stability of the 2D FeCr2S4 is also confirmed via Raman spectroscopy and Hall hysteresis loops. The robust anisotropic ferrimagnetism, the thickness&#8208;independent of Curie temperature, coupled with excellent air&#8208;stability, make 2D FeCr2S4 crystals highly attractive for future spintronic devices.

         <title>Ordered Perovskite Structure with Functional Units for High Performance and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite films based on the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) are constructed. With this structure, the ion migration within the active layer is successfully suppressed. Solar cells show negligible hysteresis and improved stability, including continuous operational and light/dark cycling tests.








Abstract
Ion migration is one of the most critical challenges that affects the stability of metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current arsenal of available strategies for solving this issue is limited. Here, novel perovskite active layers following the concept of ordered structures with functional units (OSFU) to intrinsically suppress ion migration, in which a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite layer is deposited by vapor deposition for light absorption and a 2D layer is deposited by solution process for ion inhibition, are constructed. As a promising result, the activation energy of ion migration increases from 0.36 eV for the conventional perovskite to 0.54 eV for the OSFU perovskite. These devices exhibit substantially enhanced operational stability in comparison with the conventional ones, retaining &gt;85% of their initial efficiencies after 1200&#8201;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1. Moreover, the OSFU devices show negligible fatigue behavior with a robust performance under light/dark cycling aging test (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol), which demonstrates the promising application of functional motif theory in this field.

         <title>A Viscous&#8208;Biofluid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels based on a 3D&#8208;WET polymerization process is designed. The SPD exhibits a rapid water drainage speed and efficient draining of viscous fluids. In a diabetic rat model, the SPD shortens inflammation phase, promotes re&#8208;epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing.

Viscous biofluids on wounds challenge conventional &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; wound dressings in efficient drainage due to their poor fluidity, generally causing prolonged inflammation, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and delayed wound closure. Herein, it is reported that a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels, prepared by a three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;templated wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (3D&#8208;WET) polymerization process, can efficiently drain viscous fluids and accelerate diabetic wound healing. The asymmetric wettability of the hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic layers and aligned hydrated hydrogel channels enable unidirectional and efficient drainage of viscous fluids away from the wounds, preventing their overhydration and inflammatory stimulation. The organogel layer can adhere onto the skin around the wounds but can be easily detached from the wet wound area, avoiding secondary trauma to the newly formed tissues. Taking a diabetic rat model as an example, the SPD can significantly downregulate the inflammation response by &#8776;70.8%, enhance the dermal remodeling by &#8776;14.3%, and shorten wound closure time by about 1/3 compared with the commercial dressing (3M, Tegaderm hydrocolloid thin dressing). This study sheds light on the development of the next generation of functional dressings for chronic wounds involving viscous biofluids.

&lt;p&gt;A self-pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels based on a 3D-WET polymerization process is designed. The SPD exhibits a rapid water drainage speed and efficient draining of viscous fluids. In a diabetic rat model, the SPD shortens inflammation phase, promotes re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Semiconductive Fillers for Dielectric Enhancement and Loss Reduction of Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of chain&#8208;like nanofibers (TiO2 and TINO) are synthesized by electrospinning for the dielectric composites. The intrinsic high&#8208;temperature loss tangent is effectively reduced by the atomic layer deposition&#8208;coated alumina shells on the nanofibers, which blocks carrier movement across the interfaces. The transformed crystalline porous alumina can further reduce dielectric loss by isolating the polymer from the nanofibers.








Abstract
Dielectric loss is a crucial factor in determining the long&#8208;term endurance for security and energy loss of dielectric composites. Here, chain&#8208;like semiconductive fibers of titanium oxide, indium, and niobium&#8208;doped titanium oxide are used for enhancing the complex dielectric properties of a polymer through composite construction, which involves significant interface enhancements. The chain&#8208;like fibers significantly enhance the dielectric constant owing to the special morphology of the fillers and their interfacial polarization, especially at higher temperatures. The dielectric loss and electrical conductivity of the composites are substantially reduced across the entire investigated temperature range, achieved by passivating the fiber surface with an alumina shell using atomic layer deposition. The as&#8208;deposited alumina shell transformed from an amorphous to a crystalline phase through thermal annealing results in a porous shell and more effective suppression of the loss tangent and electrical conductivity. A plausible mechanism for loss suppression is associated with carrier movement along the surface of the fibers and bulk, leading to a higher loss tangent. The alumina shell blocks the carrier transport path, particularly at the interfaces, resulting in a reduced interfacial polarization contribution and energy storage loss. This study provides a method for inhibiting dielectric loss by fabricating fillers with special surfaces.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Chemical&#8208;Gated Hydrogel Actuation Systems for Information 3D&#8208;Encoding Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By replicating the chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscles for on&#8208;demand color/pattern display, a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction gating strategy is proposed to dynamically program and gate the thermoresponsiveness of smart hydrogel actuators after material manufacture, followed by the demonstration of robust chemical&#8208;gated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding information carriers with enhanced display security.








Abstract
Cephalopods evolve the acetylcholine&#8208;gated actuation control function of their skin muscles, which enables their dynamic/static multimode display capacities for achieving perfectly spatial control over the colors/patterns on every inch of skin. Reproduction of artificial analogs that exhibit similar multimodal display is essential to reach advanced information three&#8208;dimensional (3D) encoding with higher security than the classic 2D&#8208;encoding strategy, but remains underdeveloped. The core difficulty is how to replicate such chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function into artificial soft actuating systems. Herein, this work proposes to develop azobenzene&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogel systems, whose upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type actuation responsiveness can be intelligently programmed or even gated by the addition of hydrophilic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) molecules for reversible association with pendant azobenzene moieties via supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions. By employing such &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated hydrogel actuator as an analogue of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscle, biomimetic mechanically modulated multicolor fluorescent display systems are designed, which demonstrate a conceptually new &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated &#8220;thermal stimulation&#8208;hydrogel actuation&#8208;fluorescence output&#8221; display mechanism. Consequently, high&#8208;security 3D&#8208;encoding information carriers with an unprecedented combination of single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output, dynamic/static dual&#8208;mode and spatially controlled display capacities are achieved. This bioinspired strategy brings functional&#8208;integrated features for artificial display systems and opens previously unidentified avenues for information security.

The biocompatible bottlebrush polymer (BB) can rapidly adhere to various substrates, offering exceptional antifouling and lubricant properties. It holds promise for treating diseases linked to bio&#8208;lubricant systems and optimizing the performance of medical devices, including contact lenses.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers (BB) have emerged as compelling candidates for biosystems to face tribological challenges, including friction and wear. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of an engineered triblock BB polymer's affinity, cell toxicity, lubrication, and wear protection in both in vitro and in vivo settings, focusing on applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and dry eye syndrome. Results show that the designed polymer rapidly adheres to various surfaces (e.g., cartilage, eye, and contact lens), forming a robust, biocompatible layer for surface lubrication and protection. The tribological performance and biocompatibility are further enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo. The exceptional lubrication performance and favorable interaction with HA position the synthesized triblock polymer as a promising candidate for innovative treatments addressing deficiencies in bio&#8208;lubricant systems.

         <title>Breaking Fundamental Limitation of Flow&#8208;Induced Anisotropic Growth for Large&#8208;Scale and Fast Printing of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropy during the growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) is effectively overcome by a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method, which enables the deposition of uniform OSCFs. Fabricated 10 &#215; 10 flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor array&#8208;based on the OSCFs exhibit substantial improvements in average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, reaching a high value among flexible organic devices.








Abstract
Advanced organic electronic technologies have put forward a pressing demand for cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs). However, solution&#8208;printed OSCFs are typically plagued by the existence of abundant structural defects, which pose a formidable challenge to achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;performance organic electronics. Here, it is elucidated that these structural defects are mainly originated from printing flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth, an important factor that is overlooked for too long. In light of this, a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method is proposed to effectively overcome the anisotropic growth, enabling the deposition of uniform OSCFs over the wafer scale at a high speed of 1.2 mm s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The resulting OSCF exhibits appealing performance with a high average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values for flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor arrays. Moreover, large&#8208;scale OSCF&#8208;based flexible logic circuits, which can be bent without degradation to a radius as small as 4.0 mm and over 1000 cycles are realized. The work provides profound insights into breaking the limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth and opens new avenues for printing large&#8208;scale organic single&#8208;crystal electronics.

         <title>Lattice Plainification Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance of P&#8208;Type PbSe Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe crystals by enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification, leading to promising power generation and thermoelectric cooling performance in p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se&#8208;based devices. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and will motivate more research on developing new thermoelectric coolers.








Abstract
Thermoelectrics has applications in power generation and refrigeration. Since only commercial Bi2Te3 has a low abundance Te, PbSe gets attention. This work enhances the near&#8208;room temperature performance of p&#8208;type PbSe through enhancing carrier mobility via lattice plainification. Composition controlled and Cu&#8208;doped p&#8208;type PbSe crystals are grown through physical vapor deposition. Results exhibit an enhanced carrier mobility &#8776;2578&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se. Microstructure characterization and density functional theory calculations verify the introduced Cu atoms filled Pb vacancies, realizing lattice plainification and enhancing the carrier mobility. The Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se sample achieves a power factor &#8776;42&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 and a ZT &#8776; 0.7 at 300&#160;K. The average ZT of it reaches &#8776;0.9 (300&#8211;573&#160;K), resulting in a single&#8208;leg power generation efficiency of 7.1% at temperature difference of 270&#160;K, comparable to that of p&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3. A 7&#8208;pairs device paired the p&#8208;type Pb0.996Cu0.0004Se with the n&#8208;type commercial Bi2Te3 shows a maximum cooling temperature difference &#8776;42&#160;K with the hot side at 300&#160;K, &#8776;65% of that of the commercial Bi2Te3 device. This work highlights the potential of p&#8208;type PbSe for power generation and refrigeration near room temperature and hope to inspire researchers on replacing commercial Bi2Te3.

         <title>Asymmetric Electron Redistribution in Niobic&#8208;Oxygen Vacancy Associates to Tune Noncovalent Interaction in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates are engineered into niobic acid atomic layers via Ar plasma etching. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The role of vacancy associates in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an open question. Herein, the Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates (VNb&#9472;O) are engineered into niobic acid (NA) atomic layers to tailor the CO2 photoreduction performance. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#9472;O vacancy associates can manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. These local symmetry breaking sites show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize nonpolar CO2 molecules and tune the noncovalent interaction of reaction intermediates. This unique configuration contributes to the 9.3 times increased activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Meantime, this VNb&#9472;O NA also shows excellent photocatalytic activity for NO3&#8722;&#8211;NH4+ synthesis, with NH4+ formation rate up to 3442&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work supplies fresh insights into the vacancy associate design for electron redistribution and noncovalent interaction tuning in photocatalysis.

         <title>Contactless User&#8208;Interactive Sensing Display for Human&#8211;Human and Human&#8211;Machine Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a single&#8208;device contactless user&#8208;interaction sensing display by integrating humidity&#8208;sensing humidity hydrogel with an alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) device. The conductivity changes of the hydrogel as a fingertip approaches or from a human breath trigger the subsecond dynamic response of the ACEL, facilitating noncontact sensing and display.








Abstract
Creating a large&#8208;scale contactless user&#8208;interactive sensing display (CUISD) with optimal features is challenging but crucial for efficient human&#8211;human or human&#8211;machine interactions. This study reports a CUISD based on dynamic alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) that responds to humidity. Subsecond humidity&#8208;induced luminescence is achieved by integrating a highly responsive hydrogel into the ACEL layer. The patterned silver nanofiber electrode and luminescence layer, produced through electrospinning and microfabrication, result in a stretchable, large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution, multicolor, and dynamic CUISD. The CUISD is implemented for the real&#8208;time control of a remote&#8208;controlled car, wherein the luminescence signals induced by touchless finger movements are distinguished and encoded to deliver specific commands. Moreover, the distinctive recognition of breathing facilitates the CUISD to serve as a visual signal transmitter for information interaction, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities. The paradigm shift depicts in this work is expected to reshape the way authors interact with each other and devices, discovering niche applications in virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse.

         <title>A Solid&#8211;Liquid Bicontinuous Fiber with Strain&#8208;Insensitive Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction for high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission, a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous fiber via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is designed. The fiber features a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, forming highly tortuous ionic channels. Remarkably, stretch mainly straightens these channels, leading to a minimal resistance increase with strain, outperforming the vast majority of existing ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission. Here, it is shown that strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8211;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. A bicontinuous fiber from polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase, is fabricated. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self&#8208;wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivity to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain&#8208;induced distortion.

         <title>Bacterial Biohybrids for Invasion of Tumor Cells Promote Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation Through Gap Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial biohybrid is designed by modifying live bacterium VNP20009 (VNP) with chito&#8208;oligosaccharide biopolymers to directly enter into tumor cells and bolster antigen cross&#8208;presentation through VNP&#8208;induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells surface, which is achieved through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP.








Abstract
Due to inherent differences in cellular composition and metabolic behavior with host cells, tumor&#8208;harbored bacteria can discriminatorily affect tumor immune landscape. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular bacteria affect antigen presentation process between tumor cells and antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) are largely unknown. The invasion behavior of attenuated Salmonella VNP20009 (VNP) into tumor cells is investigated and an attempt is made to modulate this behavior by modifying positively charged polymers on the surface of VNP. It is found that non&#8208;toxic chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) modified VNP (VNP@COS) bolsters the formation of gap junction between tumor cells and APCs by enhancing the ability of VNP to infect tumor cells. On this basis, a bacterial biohybrid is designed to promote in situ antigen cross&#8208;presentation through intracellular bacteria induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP@COS. This strategic integration serves to heighten the immunogenic exposure of tumor antigens; while, preserving the cytotoxic potency of T cells. A strategy is proposed to precisely controlling the function and local effects of microorganisms within tumors.

         <title>The Nanoplasmonic Purcell Effect in Ultrafast and High&#8208;Light&#8208;Yield Perovskite Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in ultrafast perovskite scintillator devices, this work predicts over tenfold enhancement in decay rate, and 38% reduction in time resolution.








Abstract
The development of X&#8208;ray scintillators with ultrahigh light yields and ultrafast response times is a long sought&#8208;after goal. In this work, a fundamental mechanism that pushes the frontiers of ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor the scintillator response time via the Purcell effect. By incorporating nanoplasmonic materials in scintillator devices, this work predicts over tenfold enhancement in decay rate and 38% reduction in time resolution even with only a simple planar design. The nanoplasmonic Purcell effect is experimentally demonstrated using perovskite scintillators, enhancing the light yield by over 120% to 88 &#177; 11 ph/keV, and the decay rate by over 60% to 2.0 &#177; 0.2 ns for the average decay time, and 0.7 &#177; 0.1 ns for the ultrafast decay component, in good agreement with the predictions of our&#160;theoretical framework. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept X&#8208;ray imaging experiments are performed using nanoplasmonic scintillators, demonstrating 182% enhancement in the modulation transfer function at four line pairs per millimeter spatial frequency. This work highlights the enormous potential of nanoplasmonics in optimizing ultrafast scintillator devices for applications including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight X&#8208;ray imaging and photon&#8208;counting computed tomography.

         <title>A Gradient Stiffness&#8208;Programmed Circuit Board by Spatially Controlled Phase&#8208;Transition of Supercooled Hydrogel for Stretchable Electronics Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research.








Abstract
Due to emerging demands in soft electronics, there is an increasing need for material architectures that support robust interfacing between soft substrates, stretchable electrical interconnects, and embedded rigid microelectronics chips. Though researchers have adopted rigid&#8208;island structures to solve the issue, this approach merely shifts stress concentrations from chip&#8208;conductor interfaces to rigid&#8208;island&#8208;soft region interfaces in the substrate. Here, a gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. The hydrogel simultaneously obtains a large stiffness disparity and robust interfaces between rigid&#8208;islands and soft regions. These seemingly contradictory conditions are accomplished by adopting a gradient stiffness structure at the interfaces, enabled by combining polymers with different interaction energies and a supercooled sodium acetate solution. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research. To highlight the practicality of this approach, a finger&#8208;sensor device that successfully distinguishes objects by direct physical contact is fabricated, demonstrating its stability under various mechanical disturbances.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;like CGL enabled by a spontaneously formed microstructured interface is fabricated with a charge&#8208;generation efficiency (CGE) exceeding 115%. Combined with the optimized LEE, a tandem QLED with low turn&#8208;on voltage of 4.0&#160;V and record peak EQE of 42.9% is achieved. An optical&#8208;electrical dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting display based on a dichromatic tandem QLED is proposed.








Abstract
In this study, the fundamental but previously overlooked factors of charge generation efficiency and light extraction efficiency (LEE) are explored and collaboratively optimized in tandem quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). By spontaneously forming a microstructured interface, a bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;like charge&#8208;generation layer composed of a poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)/ZnO bilayer is fabricated and an ideal charge&#8208;generation efficiency surpassing 115% is obtained. The coupling strength of the waveguide mode for the top unit and the plasmon polariton loss for the bottom unit are highly suppressed using precise thickness control, which increases the LEE of the tandem devices. The red tandem QLED achieves an exceptionally low turn&#8208;on voltage for electroluminescence at 4.0&#160;V and outstanding peak external quantum efficiency of 42.9%. The ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage originates from the sequential electroluminescence turn&#8208;on of the two emissive units of the tandem QLED. Benefiting from its unique electroluminescent features, an easily fabricated optical&#8208;electrical dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is built by combining a dichromatic tandem QLED with masking technology.

         <title>Gradient High&#8208;Q Dielectric Metasurfaces for Broadband Sensing and Control of Vibrational Light&#8208;Matter Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>

Mid&#8208;infrared all&#8208;dielectric gradient metasurfaces, realized by gradually varying unit cell parameters along the structure, provide continuous tuning of high&#8208;Q resonances over an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range in a compact device footprint. The unmatched flexibility of such metasurfaces for SEIRA applications, including polymer mixture deconvolution, sensitive broadband biomolecule detection, and exploring the onset of vibrational strong coupling are demonstrated.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has emerged as a powerful technique for ultrasensitive chemical&#8208;specific analysis. SEIRA can be realized by employing metasurfaces that can enhance light&#8208;matter interactions in the spectral bands of molecular vibrations. Increasing sample complexity emphasizes the need for metasurfaces that can operate simultaneously at different spectral bands, both accessing rich spectral information over a broad band, and resolving subtle differences in the absorption fingerprints through narrow&#8208;band resonances. Here, a novel concept of resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces is introduced, where the required spectral selectivity is achieved via local high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) resonances, while the continuous coverage of a broad band is enabled by the gradual adjustment of the unit&#8208;cell dimensions along the planar structure. The highly tailorable design of the gradient metasurfaces provides flexibility for shaping the spectral sampling density to match the relevant bands of target analytes while keeping a compact device footprint. The versatility of the gradient metasurfaces is demonstrated through several sensing scenarios, including polymer mixture deconvolution, detecting a multistep bioassay, and identification of the onset of vibrational strong coupling regime. The proposed gradient&#8208;resonance platform significantly contributes to the rapidly evolving landscape of nonlocal metasurfaces, enabling applications in molecular detection and analysis of fundamental light&#8208;matter interaction phenomena.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Interlayer Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaics with Power Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 20%</title>

High&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OVP) with efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved via the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy. The use of 2PACz&#8208;SAI advances the surface/interface optoelectronic properties, including mitigated parasitic absorption, improved optical field distribution and the carrier dynamics. Moreover, the efficacy of SAI strategy is widely proved. Additionally, the 2PACz&#8208;SAI based ST&#8208;OPV exhibits a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%.








Abstract
Interfacial layers (ILs) are prerequisites to form the selective charge transport for high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) but mostly result in considerable parasitic absorption loss. Trimming the ILs down to a mono&#8208;molecular level via the self&#8208;assembled monolayer is an effective strategy to mitigate parasitic absorption loss. However, such a strategy suffers from inferior electrical contact with low surface coverage on rough surfaces and poor producibility. To address these issues, here, the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy is developed, which involves a thin layer of 2&#8211;6&#160;nm to form a full coverage on the substrate via both covalent and van der Waals bonds by using a self&#8208;assembled molecule of 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) (2PACz). Via the facile spin coating without further rinsing and annealing process, it not only optimizes the electrical and optical properties of OPVs, which enables a world&#8208;record efficiency of 20.17% (19.79% certified) but also simplifies the tedious processing procedure. Moreover, the SAI strategy is especially useful in improving the absorbing selectivity for semi&#8208;transparent OPVs, which enables a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%. This work provides an effective strategy of SAI to optimize the optical and electrical properties of OPVs for high&#8208;performance and solar window applications.

         <title>Spontaneous Wetting Induced by Contact&#8208;Electrification at Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a droplet spreads on a polymer surface, simultaneous charge exchange occurs at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Repeated contact electrification leads to accumulated charges on the substrate, inducing spontaneous wetting phenomena. Contact angle variation strongly depends on surface charge density. Contact electrification induced wetting (CEW) can alter contact angles by 5&#176;~38&#176; across different materials.








Abstract
Wettability significantly influences various surface interactions and applications at the liquid&#8211;solid interface. However, the understanding is complicated by the intricate charge exchange occurring through contact electrification (CE) during this process. The understanding of the influence of triboelectric charge on wettability remains challenging, especially due to the complexities involved in concurrently measuring contact angles and interfacial electrical signals. Here, the relationship is investigated between surface charge density and change of contact angle of dielectric films after contact with water droplets. It is observed that the charge exchange when water spared lead to a spontaneous wetting phenomenon, which is termed as the contact electrification induced wetting (CEW). Notably, these results demonstrate a linear dependence between the change of contact angle (CA) of the materials and the density of surface charge on the solid surface. Continuous CEW tests show that not only the static CA but also the dynamics of wetting are influenced by the accumulation charges at the interface. The mechanism behind CEW involves the redistribution of surface charges on a solid surface and polar water molecules within liquid. This interaction results in a decrease in interface energy, leading to a reduction in the CA. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduction in interface energy may stem from the enhanced surface charge on the substrate, which strengthens the hydrogen bond interaction between water and the substrate. These findings have the potential to advance the understanding of CE and wetting phenomena, with applications in energy harvesting, catalysis, and droplet manipulation at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces.

         <title>High Entropy Alloys Enable Durable and Efficient Lithium&#8208;Mediated CO2 Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, hcp NiFeCoCuRu HEAs with a 2.17 nm particle size, immobilized on KB matrix at 30 wt%, are designed. HEA30/KB catalyst exhibits robust performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries (LCBs), achieving &#8776;3000 h stability and low overpotential (0.82 V). XAS analyses and theoretical calculations reveal charge redistribution and active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni as key factors.








Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for multistep reduction and oxidation reactions is challenging. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are intriguing due to their tunable geometric and electronic structure through entropy effects. However, understanding the origin of their exceptional performance and identifying active centers is hindered by the diverse microenvironment in HEAs. Herein, NiFeCoCuRu HEAs designed with an average diameter of 2.17 nm, featuring different adsorption capacities for various reactants and intermediates in Li&#8208;mediated CO2 redox reactions, are introduced. The electronegativity&#8208;dependent nature of NiFeCoCuRu HEAs induces significant charge redistribution, shifting the d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level and forming highly active clusters of Ru, Co, and Ni for Li&#8208;based compounds adsorptions. This lowers energy barriers and simultaneously stabilizes *LiCO2 and LiCO3+CO intermediates, enhancing the efficiency of both CO2 reduction and Li2CO3 decomposition over extended periods. This work provides insights into specific active site interactions with intermediates, highlighting the potential of HEAs as promising catalysts for intricate CO2 redox reactions.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Fluorophores: Ultrabright Fluorescent Supramolecular Assemblies Derived from Conventional Fluorophores in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent supramolecular assemblies in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in Supra&#8208;fluorophores with high brightness.








Abstract
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts are invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. This study presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, this course has employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide&#8208;diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#160;060 m&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 nm&#8722;3). Moreover, high&#8208;performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20&#8208;fold increase in both brightness and photostability. This Supra&#8208;fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.

The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of a cyclic peptide-based supramolecular scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation-caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in Supra-fluorophores with high brightness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts are invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. This study presents a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra-fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, this course has employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide-diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation-caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron-dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&amp;gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#160;060 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, high-performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20-fold increase in both brightness and photostability. This Supra-fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Nontrivial Hyperbolic Metasurfaces
In article number 2311599, Li&#8208;Yang Zheng, Ming&#8208;Hui Lu, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers report a pillared metasurface whose nontrivial lattice topology gives rise to MHz vibrations resilient against disorder. Furthermore, the lattice symmetry ensures hyperbolic dispersion, which enables highly directional vibrations like a blazing trail of fire.

Stretchable Electronics
A major challenge in stretchable electronics integration is the stress concentration that occurs at the interface of rigid chips and soft conductors. Article number 2313344 by Seung Hwan Ko and co&#8208;workers solves the issue by fabricating a gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board. Notably, the circuit board fully utilizes the spatially controlled phase&#8208;transition of supercooled hydrogel.

Nanoplasmonic Purcell Effect
In article number 2309410, Liang Jie Wong, Muhammad Danang Birowosuto, Christophe Dujardin, and co&#8208;workers present a fundamental mechanism enhancing ultrafast X&#8208;ray scintillator performance: the use of nanoscale&#8208;confined surface plasmon polariton modes to tailor scintillator light yield and response time via the Purcell effect. Incorporating nanoplasmonic structures in ultrafast perovskite scintillator devices yields over tenfold enhancement in decay rate, and a 38% reduction in time resolution.

3D&#8208;Encoding Display
In article number 2401659, Tao Chen, Wei Lu, Chuanzhuang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers propose a supramolecular host&#8208;guest interaction gating strategy that is capable of dynamically programming or even gating the thermo&#8208;responsiveness of smart hydrogel actuators after material manufacture. Thus, a robust chemical&#8208;gated 3D&#8208;encoding information carrier with enhanced display security is demonstrated by replicating the chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function of cephalopods' skin muscles for on&#8208;demand color/pattern display.

Bioengineered Human Embryo Models
Here, a bioengineered human stem cell&#8208;based embryo model can be seen that models a monochorionic twin embryo right before it would implant into the womb. It contains a cystic GATA3+ trophectoderm&#8208;like epithelium (in red) encasing two distinct inner cell masses (in green the epiblast&#8208;like cells and in blue the hypoblast&#8208;like cells). More details can be found in article number 2313306 by Stefan Giselbrecht, Erik J. Vrij, and co&#8208;workers.

Skin Secretion of Andrias davidianus&#8208;Patch
A nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the skin secretion of SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is potentially adaptable to broad applications, under different pH values and air or liquid pressures, in sutureless wound sealing and healing. More details can be found in article number 2309774 by Yu Shrike Zhang, Jinlin Song, Ximu Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism
In article number 2309172, Atsushi Fujimori, Di&#8208;Jing Huang, and co&#8208;workers unveil a giant X&#8208;ray circular dichroism in a collinear antiferromagnet with a chiral lattice, possessing time&#8208;reversal symmetry. This unique material qualifies as an altermagnet, characterized by fully compensated spins and the breaking of the combined symmetry of parity and time reversal. Below the transition temperature of collinear antiferromagnetism, X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism enhances remarkably, and its sign of domains with opposite chiralities reverses, highlighting one of the intriguing features of altermagnets.

         <title>Structural Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Enhancing Petrochemical Catalytic Reaction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research summarizes the research progress of single atom catalysts (SACs) in petrochemical catalytic reaction process, proposes the role of structural regulation of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates reaction mechanisms of SACs in the petrochemical processes, and then provides outlook on design, identification of active sites and the application of artificial intelligence technology for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs.








Abstract
Petroleum, as the &#8220;lifeblood&#8221; of industrial development, is the important energy source and raw material. The selective transformation of petroleum into high&#8208;end chemicals is of great significance, but still exists enormous challenges. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites, promise a broad application in petrochemical processes. Herein, the research systematically summarizes the recent research progress of SACs in petrochemical catalytic reaction, proposes the role of structural design of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates the catalytic reaction mechanisms of SACs in the conversion of petrochemical processes, and reveals the high activity origins of SACs at the atomic scale. Finally, the key challenges are summarized and an outlook on the design, identification of active sites, and the appropriate application of artificial intelligence technology is provided for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs in petrochemical process.

         <title>Nanoscale Methods for Longitudinal Extraction of Intracellular Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Longitudinal analysis of cell dynamics is key to advancing biological and medical research, yet traditional methods disrupt cells, limiting sampling to single timepoints and overlooking cellular heterogeneity. Reversibly accessing the cellular membrane for non&#8208;destructive extraction of intracellular contents is a novel concept achieved by recent nanoscale technologies. This perspective explores these nanoscale innovations and addresses challenges in attaining rigorous sampling.








Abstract
Longitudinal analysis of intracellular contents including gene and protein expression is crucial for deciphering the fundamentally dynamic nature of cells.

&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal analysis of cell dynamics is key to advancing biological and medical research, yet traditional methods disrupt cells, limiting sampling to single timepoints and overlooking cellular heterogeneity. Reversibly accessing the cellular membrane for non-destructive extraction of intracellular contents is a novel concept achieved by recent nanoscale technologies. This perspective explores these nanoscale innovations and addresses challenges in attaining rigorous sampling.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal analysis of intracellular contents including gene and protein expression is crucial for deciphering the fundamentally dynamic nature of cells.

         <title>Understanding Advanced Transition Metal&#8208;Based Two Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts from the Perspective of Phase Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on how phase engineering can essentially revive the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction performance of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the design of advanced transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts at the atomic scale, which is expected to inspire further research in the development of novel transition metal&#8208;based two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble transition metal (TM)&#8208;based compounds have recently become a focal point of extensive research interest as electrocatalysts for the two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) process. To efficiently drive this reaction, these TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts must bear unique physiochemical properties, which are strongly dependent on their phase structures. Consequently, adopting engineering strategies toward the phase structure has emerged as a cutting&#8208;edge scientific pursuit, crucial for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in the electrocatalytic process. This comprehensive review addresses the intricate field of phase engineering applied to non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based compounds for 2e&#8722; ORR. First, the connotation of phase engineering and fundamental concepts related to oxygen reduction kinetics and thermodynamics are succinctly elucidated. Subsequently, the focus shifts to a detailed discussion of various phase engineering approaches, including elemental doping, defect creation, heterostructure construction, coordination tuning, crystalline design, and polymorphic transformation to boost or revive the 2e&#8722; ORR performance (selectivity, activity, and stability) of TM&#8208;based catalysts, accompanied by an insightful exploration of the phase&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the review proposes fresh perspectives on the current challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field, together with several critical research directions for the future development of non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Unveiling Confinement Engineering for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the innovative confinement effect in rechargeable batteries, presenting a promising approach to address key challenges. It delves into categorizing confinement across scales and proposing strategic designs for manipulating physicochemical properties, electrode stability, and ion transfer. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for harnessing confinement to develop high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
The confinement effect, restricting materials within nano/sub&#8208;nano spaces, has emerged as an innovative approach for fundamental research in diverse application fields, including chemical engineering, membrane separation, and catalysis. This confinement principle recently presents fresh perspectives on addressing critical challenges in rechargeable batteries. Within spatial confinement, novel microstructures and physiochemical properties have been raised to promote the battery performance. Nevertheless, few clear definitions and specific reviews are available to offer a comprehensive understanding and guide for utilizing the confinement effect in batteries. This review aims to fill this gap by primarily summarizing the categorization of confinement effects across various scales and dimensions within battery systems. Subsequently, the strategic design of confinement environments is proposed to address existing challenges in rechargeable batteries. These solutions involve the manipulation of the physicochemical properties of electrolytes, the regulation of electrochemical activity, and stability of electrodes, and insights into ion transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, specific perspectives are provided to deepen the foundational understanding of the confinement effect for achieving high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Overall, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of confinement effects in tailoring the microstructure and physiochemical properties of electrode materials, highlighting their crucial role in designing novel energy storage devices.

         <title>Photoluminescent Characterization of Metal Nanoclusters: Basic Parameters, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of luminescent materials. Photoluminescent characterization plays a huge role in revealing the luminescent mechanism of nanoclusters and designing nanocluster&#8208;based applications. This review discusses the parameters and measurement methods in characterizing luminescent nanoclusters from the basic principles to the revelation of luminescent mechanisms and construction of practical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) can be synthesized with atomically precise structures and molecule formulae due to the rapid development of nanocluster science in recent decades. The ultrasmall size range (normally &lt; 2 nm) endows MNCs with plenty of molecular&#8208;like properties, among which photoluminescent properties have aroused extensive attention. Tracing the research and development processes of luminescent nanoclusters, various photoluminescent analysis and characterization methods play a significant role in elucidating luminescent mechanism and analyzing luminescent properties. In this review, it is aimed to systematically summarize the normally used photoluminescent characterizations in MNCs including basic parameters and methods, such as excitation/emission wavelength, quantum yield, and lifetime. For each key parameter, first its definition and meaning is introduced and then the relevant characterization methods including measuring principles and the revelation of luminescent properties from the collected data are discussed. Then, it is discussed in details how to explore the luminescent mechanism of MNCs and construct NC&#8208;based applications based on the measured data. By means of these characterization strategies, the luminescent properties of MNCs and NC&#8208;based designs can be explained quantitatively and qualitatively. Hence, this review is expected to provide clear guidance for researchers to characterize luminescent MNCs and better understand the luminescent mechanism from the measured results.

         <title>All&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells: Defect Regulation and Emerging Applications in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes defect formation causes, discusses the defect regulation strategies for all&#8211;inorganic PSCs from interface, internal, and surface engineering in recent years, and overviews the development in terrestrial ecosystem, alongside conducting an in&#8208;depth analysis and summary of their potential developmental stage under extreme conditions such as those encountered in space and underwater environments.








Abstract
All&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as CsPbX3, have garnered considerable attention recently, as they exhibit superior thermodynamic and optoelectronic stabilities compared to the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSCs. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbX3 PSCs is generally lower than that of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSCs, as they contain higher defect densities at the interface and within the perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layers, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss. Consequently, defect regulation has been adopted as an important strategy to improve device performance and stability. This review aims to comprehensively summarize recent progresses on the defect regulation in CsPbX3 PSCs, as well as their cutting&#8208;edge applications in extreme scenarios. The underlying fundamental mechanisms leading to the defect formation in the crystal structure of CsPbX3 PSCs are firstly discussed, and an overview of literature&#8208;adopted defect regulation strategies in the context of interface, internal, and surface engineering is provided. Cutting&#8208;edge applications of CsPbX3 PSCs in extreme environments such as outer space and underwater situations are highlighted. Finally, a summary and outlook are presented on future directions for achieving higher efficiencies and superior stability in CsPbX3 PSCs.

         <dc:description>
A critical review on remaining challenges and promising solutions for the practical applications of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries is presented. The significance of various crucial parameters for the actual gravimetric energy density of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries is highlighted, and suggestions for the practical values of the crucial parameters are rationally proposed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries are promising alternatives for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density and high power density. However, some notorious issues are hampering the practical application of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Besides, the working mechanism of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries under practical conditions such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte, and low capacity ratio between the negative and positive electrode (N/P ratio), is of essential importance for practical applications, yet the significance of these parameters has long been disregarded. Herein, it is comprehensively reviewed recent advances on Na metal anode, S cathode, electrolyte, and separator engineering for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. The discrepancies between laboratory research and practical conditions are elaborately discussed, endeavors toward practical applications are highlighted, and suggestions for the practical values of the crucial parameters are rationally proposed. Furthermore, an empirical equation to estimate the actual energy density of RT&#8208;Na/S pouch cells under practical conditions is rationally proposed for the first time, making it possible to evaluate the gravimetric energy density of the cells under practical conditions. This review aims to reemphasize the vital importance of the crucial parameters for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries to bridge the gaps between laboratory research and practical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 25, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of organic electrocatalysts is proposed including classifying all kinds of organic electrocatalysts into four types and identifying indicators/descriptors of electrocatalytic activities based on their influence on four fundamental electrochemical characteristics determining the overall performance of electrocatalysis. Moreover, five strategies for fully revealing the original electrocatalytic activity and stability of organic electrocatalyst in practical applications are also concluded.








Abstract
Efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal for advancing green energy conversion technologies. Organic electrocatalysts, as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble&#8208;metal benchmarks, have garnered attention. However, the understanding of the relationships between their properties and electrocatalytic activities remains ambiguous. Plenty of research articles regarding low&#8208;cost organic electrocatalysts started to gain momentum in 2010 and have been flourishing recently though, a review article for both entry&#8208;level and experienced researchers in this field is still lacking. This review underscores the urgent need to elucidate the structure&#8211;activity relationship and design suitable electrode structures, leveraging the unique features of organic electrocatalysts like controllability and compatibility for real&#8208;world applications. Organic electrocatalysts are classified into four groups: small molecules, oligomers, polymers, and frameworks, with specific structural and physicochemical properties serving as activity indicators. To unlock the full potential of organic electrocatalysts, five strategies are discussed: integrated structures, surface property modulation, membrane technologies, electrolyte affinity regulation, and addition of anticorrosion species, all aimed at enhancing charge efficiency, mass transfer, and long&#8208;term stability during electrocatalytic reactions. The review offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of organic electrocatalysts and their practical applications, bridging the understanding gap and paving the way for future developments of more efficient green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Freezing Shrinkage Dynamics and Surface Dendritic Growth of Floating Refractory Alloy Droplets in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freezing shrinkage and dendritic growth are of great importance for various alloys solidified from high&#8208;temperature liquids to solids since they dominate microstructure patterns and follow&#8208;up processing. It is found that microgravity solidification leads to remarkable freezing shrinkage cavities and distinctive surface dendritic microstructure patterns in outer space.








Abstract
The freezing shrinkage and dendritic growth are of great importance for various alloys solidified from high&#8208;temperature liquids to solids since they dominate microstructure patterns and follow&#8208;up processing. However, the microgravity freezing shrinkage dynamics is scarcely explored on the ground as it is hard to suppress the strong natural convection inside liquid alloys. Here, a series of in&#8208;orbit solidification experiments is conducted aboard the China Space Station with a long&#8208;term stable 10&#8722;5 g0 microgravity condition. The highest temperature up to 2265&#160;K together with substantial liquid undercoolings far from a thermodynamically stable state are attained for both Nb82.7Si17.3 and Zr64V36 refractory alloys. Furthermore, the solidification under microgravity of a droplet is simulated to reveal the liquid&#8211;solid interface migration, temperature gradient, and flow field. The microgravity solidification process leads to freezing shrinkage cavities and distinctive surface dendritic microstructure patterns. The combined effects of shrinkage dynamics and liquid surface flow in outer space result in the dendrites growing not only along the tangential direction but also along the normal direction to the droplet surface. These space experimental results contribute to a further understanding of the solidification behavior of liquid alloys under a weaker convection condition, which is often masked by gravity on the ground.

         <title>Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging with ROS&#8208;Responsive Bilirubin Nanoparticles Enables Monitoring of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Progression to Cirrhosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a novel nanoparticle&#8208;based imaging probe and associated dual input pseudo&#8208;threecompartment model is reported that enables monitoring the progression of NASH and its transition to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MRI. Manganese ion&#8208;chelated bilirubin nanoparticles undergo disintegration upon reaction with ROS, thereby releasing free Mn2+ and inducing considerable MRI signal enhancement.








Abstract
Despite the vital importance of monitoring the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an efficient imaging modality that is readily available at hospitals is currently lacking. Here, a new magnetic&#8208;resonance&#8208;imaging (MRI)&#8208;based imaging modality is presented that allows for efficient and longitudinal monitoring of NAFLD and NASH progression. The imaging modality uses manganese&#8208;ion (Mn2+)&#8208;chelated bilirubin nanoparticles (Mn@BRNPs) as a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive MRI imaging probe. Longitudinal T1&#8208;weighted MR imaging of NASH model mice is performed after injecting Mn@BRNPs intravenously. The MR signal enhancement in the liver relative to muscle gradually increases up to 8 weeks of NASH progression, but decreases significantly as NASH progresses to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage at weeks 10 and 12. A new dual input pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;compartment model is developed to provide information on NASH stage with a single MRI scan. It is also demonstrated that the ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs can be used to monitor the efficacy of potential anti&#8208;NASH drugs with conventional MRI. The findings suggest that the ROS&#8208;responsive Mn@BRNPs have the potential to serve as an efficient MRI contrast for monitoring NASH progression and its transition to the cirrhosis&#8208;like stage.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Asymmetric Porous Mesh with Dynamic Mechanical Support Properties Enables Efficient Single&#8208;Stage Repair of Contaminated Abdominal Wall Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO) designed via simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of PVA solution on the loosely porous surface of SIS can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio&#8208;adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single&#8208;stage surgery, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.








Abstract
Contamination tolerance and long&#8208;term mechanical support are the two critical properties of meshes for contaminated abdominal wall defect repair. However, biological meshes with excellent pollution tolerance fail to provide bio&#8208;adaptive long&#8208;term mechanical support due to their rapid degradation. Here, a novel double&#8208;layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO) is designed by simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of sticky polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution on the loosely porous surface of small intestinal submucosal decellularized matrix (SIS), which can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio&#8208;adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single&#8208;stage surgery. The exosome&#8208;loaded degradable loosely porous SIS layer accelerates the tissue healing; meanwhile, the exosome&#8208;loaded densely porous PVA layer can maintain long&#8208;term mechanical support without any abdominal adhesion. In addition, the tensile strength and strain at break of SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO mesh change gradually from 0.37&#160;MPa and 210% to 0.10&#160;MPa and 385% with the degradation of SIS layer. This unique performance can dynamically adapt to the variable mechanical demands during different periods of contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction.

&lt;p&gt;Double-layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA-EXO) designed via simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of PVA solution on the loosely porous surface of SIS can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio-adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single-stage surgery, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contamination tolerance and long-term mechanical support are the two critical properties of meshes for contaminated abdominal wall defect repair. However, biological meshes with excellent pollution tolerance fail to provide bio-adaptive long-term mechanical support due to their rapid degradation. Here, a novel double-layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA-EXO) is designed by simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8211;thaw of sticky polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution on the loosely porous surface of small intestinal submucosal decellularized matrix (SIS), which can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio-adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single-stage surgery. The exosome-loaded degradable loosely porous SIS layer accelerates the tissue healing; meanwhile, the exosome-loaded densely porous PVA layer can maintain long-term mechanical support without any abdominal adhesion. In addition, the tensile strength and strain at break of SIS/PVA-EXO mesh change gradually from 0.37&#160;MPa and 210% to 0.10&#160;MPa and 385% with the degradation of SIS layer. This unique performance can dynamically adapt to the variable mechanical demands during different periods of contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction. As a result, this SIS/PVA-EXO mesh shows an attractive prospect in the treatment of contaminated abdominal wall defect without recurrence by integrating local immune regulation, tissue remodeling, and dynamic mechanical supporting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Ultrathin Ferroelectric Magnesium Molybdenum Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 crystals are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition. Mg2Mo3O8 crystals of varying thicknesses exhibit notable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties at room temperature, with ferroelectricity retained even at 2&#160;nm thickness. This work introduces nolanites&#8208;type crystals into ultrathin ferroelectrics. The scalable synthesis of stable ultrathin ferroelectric Mg2Mo3O8 expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and may prosper applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
The development of ultrathin, stable ferroelectric materials is crucial for advancing high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power electronic devices. Nonetheless, ultrathin ferroelectric materials are rare due to the critical size effect. Here, a novel ferroelectric material, magnesium molybdenum oxide (Mg2Mo3O8) is presented. High&#8208;quality ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 crystals are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ultrathin Mg2Mo3O8 has a wide bandgap (&#8776;4.4&#160;eV) and nonlinear optical response. Mg2Mo3O8 crystals of varying thicknesses exhibit out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties at room temperature, with ferroelectricity retained even at a 2&#160;nm thickness. The Mg2Mo3O8 exhibits a relatively large remanent polarization ranging from 33 to 52&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is tunable by changing its thickness. Notably, Mg2Mo3O8 possesses a high Curie temperature (&gt;980&#160;&#176;C) across various thicknesses. Moreover, the as&#8208;grown Mg2Mo3O8 crystals display remarkable stability under harsh environments. This work introduces nolanites&#8208;type crystal into ultrathin ferroelectrics. The scalable synthesis of stable ultrathin ferroelectric Mg2Mo3O8 expands the scope of ferroelectric materials and may prosper applications of ferroelectrics.

         <title>Electroacoustic Responsive Cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip</title>

This work presents a novel cochlea organoids&#8208;integrated conductive hydrogel biohybrid system with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) for cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip construction and high&#8208;throughput drug screening. With this cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform, high&#8208;maturity cochlear organoids can be obtained. The authors also demonstrate the sensitivity of the cochlear organoids to different drug concentrations and screen the precise drug information that can protect the cochlea.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips can highly simulate the complex physiological functions of organs, exhibiting broad application prospects in developmental research, disease simulation, as well as new drug research and development. However, there is still less concern about effectively constructing cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;chips. Here, a novel cochlear organoids&#8208;integrated conductive hydrogel biohybrid system with cochlear implant electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) for cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip construction and high&#8208;throughput drug screening, is presented. Benefiting from the superior biocompatibility and electrical property of conductive hydrogel, together with cochlear implant EAS, the inner ear progenitor cells can proliferate and spontaneously shape into spheres, finally forming cochlear organoids with good cell viability and structurally mature hair cells. By incorporating these progenitor cells&#8208;encapsulated hydrogels into a microfluidic&#8208;based cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with culture chambers and a concentration gradient generator, a dynamic and high&#8208;throughput evaluation of inner ear disease&#8208;related drugs is demonstrated. These results indicate that the proposed cochlea&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform has great application potential in organoid cultivation and deafness drug evaluation.

         <title>An Integrated Deposition and Passivation Strategy for Controlled Crystallization of 2D/3D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for depositing multidimensional perovskite thin films is presented, incorporating phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) treatment into the antisolvent step for 3D perovskite formation. Using multimodal in situ characterization, it is shown that PEACl slows crystal growth, resulting in reduced grain boundary recombination and improved device efficiency. PEACl also forms hydrophobic 2D structures, protecting the film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.








Abstract
This work introduces a simplified deposition procedure for multidimensional (2D/3D) perovskite thin films, integrating a phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl)&#8208;treatment into the antisolvent step when forming the 3D perovskite. This simultaneous deposition and passivation strategy reduces the number of synthesis steps while simultaneously stabilizing the halide perovskite film and improving the photovoltaic performance of resulting solar cell devices to 20.8%. Using a combination of multimodal in situ and additional ex situ characterizations, it is demonstrated that the introduction of PEACl during the perovskite film formation slows down the crystal growth process, which leads to a larger average grain size and narrower grain size distribution, thus reducing carrier recombination at grain boundaries and improving the device's performance and stability. The data suggests that during annealing of the wet film, the PEACl diffuses to the surface of the film, forming hydrophobic (quasi&#8208;)2D structures that protect the bulk of the perovskite film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.

         <title>Ionic Conduction&#8208;Based Polycrystalline Oxide Gamma Ray Detection &#8211; Radiation&#8208;Ionic Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New radiation detection devices based on ionic conduction modulation at grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. This paves the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh environments. Opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors are created benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.








Abstract
Newly discovered opto&#8208;ionic effects in metal oxides provide unique opportunities for functional ceramic applications. The authors generalize the recently demonstrated grain boundary opto&#8208;ionic effect observed in solid electrolyte thin films under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to a radiation&#8208;ionic effect that can be applied to bulk materials and used for gamma&#8208;rays (&#947;&#8208;rays) detection. Near room temperature, lightly doped Gd&#8208;doped CeO2, a polycrystalline ion conducting ceramic, exhibits a resistance ratio change &#8776;103 and reversible response in ionic current when exposed to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray (1.1 and 1.3 MeV). This is attributed to the steady state passivation of space charge barriers at grain boundaries, that act as virtual electrodes, capturing radiation&#8208;induced electrons, in turn lowering space charge barrier heights, and thereby exclusively modulating the ionic carrier flow within the ceramic electrolytes. Such behavior allows significant electrical response under low fields, that is, &lt; 2 V cm&#8722;1, paving the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh (high temperature, pressure, and corrosive) environments. This discovery presents opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.

Opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors are created benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly discovered opto-ionic effects in metal oxides provide unique opportunities for functional ceramic applications. The authors generalize the recently demonstrated grain boundary opto-ionic effect observed in solid electrolyte thin films under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to a radiation-ionic effect that can be applied to bulk materials and used for gamma-rays (&#947;-rays) detection. Near room temperature, lightly doped Gd-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a polycrystalline ion conducting ceramic, exhibits a resistance ratio change &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and reversible response in ionic current when exposed to &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co &#947;-ray (1.1 and 1.3 MeV). This is attributed to the steady state passivation of space charge barriers at grain boundaries, that act as virtual electrodes, capturing radiation-induced electrons, in turn lowering space charge barrier heights, and thereby exclusively modulating the ionic carrier flow within the ceramic electrolytes. Such behavior allows significant electrical response under low fields, that is, &amp;lt; 2 V cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, paving the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low-power, and miniaturizable solid-state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh (high temperature, pressure, and corrosive) environments. This discovery presents opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonhalogenated Solvent Processable and High&#8208;Density Photopatternable Polymer Semiconductors Enabled by Incorporating Hydroxyl Groups in the Side Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to boost the solubility of polymer semiconductors in nonhalogenated solvents by appending hydroxyl groups in the side chains is developed. With tetrahydrofuran as the processing and developing solvents, high&#8208;density photopatterning arrays with &#8776;82&#160;000 devices cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, while the charge mobilities of the patterned thin films are mostly maintained.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors hold tremendous potential for applications in flexible devices, which is however hindered by the fact that they are usually processed by halogenated solvents rather than environmentally more friendly solvents. An effective strategy to boost the solubility of high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductors in nonhalogenated solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) by appending hydroxyl groups in the side chains is herein presented. The results show that hydroxyl groups, which can be easily incorporated into the side chains, can significantly improve the solubility of typical p&#8208; and n&#8208;types as well as ambipolar polymer semiconductors in THF. Meanwhile, the thin films of these polymer semiconductors from the respective THF solutions show high charge mobilities. With THF as the processing and developing solvents these polymer semiconductors with hydroxyl groups in the side chains can be well photopatterned in the presence of the photo&#8208;crosslinker, and the charge mobilities of the patterned thin films are mostly maintained by comparing with those of the respective pristine thin films. Notably, THF is successfully utilized as the processing and developing solvent to achieve high&#8208;density photopatterning with &#8776;82&#160;000 device arrays cm&#8722;2 for polymer semiconductors in which hydroxyl groups are appended in the side chains.

The method uses a unique catalyst consisting of an alloy of Au and an alkali metal halide (NaCl) to enable rapid and directional growth. High yields of two types of NbS3 1D nanostructures, nanowires and nanoribbons, each with sub&#8208;ten nanometer diameter, tens of micrometers length, and distinct 1D morphology and growth orientation are demonstrated. Strategies to control the location, size, and morphology of growth, and extend the growth method to synthesize other transition metal trichalcogenides, NbSe3 and TiS3, as nanowires are demonstrated. Finally, the role of the Au&#8211;NaCl alloy catalyst in guiding VLS synthesis is described and the growth mechanism based on the relationships measured between structure (growth orientation, morphology, and dimensions) and growth conditions (catalyst volume and growth time) is discussed. These results introduce opportunities to expand the library of emerging 1D vdW materials to make use of their unique properties through controlled growth at nanoscale dimensions.

         <title>Ultrathin Ambipolar Polyelectrolyte Capacitors Prepared via Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Assembling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, ambipolar polyelectrolyte capacitors are prepared leveraging a multilayer stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer with thickness down to 10&#160;nm. The ambipolar nature of the polyelectrolyte dielectric stack improves the capacitive performance of the device and extends the frequency range of operation, compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art unipolar counterpart.








Abstract
Miniaturized solid state capacitors leveraging migration of unipolar ions in a single polyelectrolyte layer sandwiched between metal electrodes, namely, polyelectrolyte capacitors (PECs), have been recently reported with areal capacitance up to 100&#8211;200&#160;nF mm&#8722;2. Nonetheless, application of PECs in consumer and industrial electronics has been hindered so far by their small operational frequency range, up to a few kHz, due to the resistive behavior (phase angle &gt;&#8722;45&#176;) of PECs in the range kHz&#8208;to&#8208;MHz. Here,&#160;it is reported on multilayer polyelectrolyte capacitors (mPECs) that leverage as dielectric an ambipolar nanometer&#8208;thick (down to 10&#160;nm) stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer between metal electrodes to eliminate the resistive behavior at frequencies from kHz to MHz. This significantly extends the operational range of mPECs over PECs. mPECs with areal capacitance as high as 25&#160;nF mm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;Hz and full capacitive behavior from 100 mHz to 10&#160;MHz are demonstrated using different assembling conditions and anionic/cationic polyelectrolyte pairs. The mPECs reliably operate over time for &gt;300 million cycles, at different biasing voltages up to 3&#160;V, and temperatures up to 80&#160;&#176;C, showing a reversible capacitive behavior without significant hysteresis. Application of mPECs in flexible electronics, also operating at high frequency, is envisaged.

         <title>Junctionless Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Device Using 2D Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Layered Materials for Ternary Parallel Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) device featuring a junctionless vdW channel. The approach for inducing the NDR phenomenon revolves around selectively inhibiting carrier transport, a result accomplished by creating a partial potential barrier within the junctionless channel. To showcase the utility of the junctionless NDR device for a ternary hardware neural network, its practical application is presented by configuring ternary logic circuits.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) devices offer a promising pathway for developing future computing technologies characterized by exceptionally low energy consumption, especially multivalued logic computing. Nevertheless, conventional approaches aimed at attaining the NDR phenomenon involve intricate junction configurations and/or external doping processes in the channel region, impeding the progress of NDR devices to the circuit and system levels. Here, an NDR device is presented that incorporates a channel without junctions. The NDR phenomenon is achieved by introducing a metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor capacitor to a portion of the channel area. This approach establishes partial potential barrier and well that effectively restrict the movement of hole and electron carriers within specific voltage ranges. Consequently, this facilitates the implementation of both a ternary inverter and a ternary static&#8208;random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, which are essential components in the development of multivalued logic computing technology.

         <title>Tailoring Perovskite Surface Potential and Chelation Advances Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of spatial symmetry on device performance is investigated by using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and comprehensive chelation compared to the asymmetrical CEA+ cations. This strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 25.60%.








Abstract
Modifying perovskite surface using various organic ammonium halide cations has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the overall performance of perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the impact of the structural symmetry of these ammonium halide cations on perovskite interface termination has remained uncertain. Here, this work investigates the influence of symmetry on the performance of the devices, using molecules based on symmetrical bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)ammonium cation (B(CE)A+) and asymmetrical 2&#8208;chloroethylammonium cation (CEA+) as interface layers between the perovskite and hole transport layer. These results reveal that the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations lead to a more homogeneous surface potential and more comprehensive chelation with uncoordinated Pb2+ compared to the asymmetrical cations, resulting in a more favorable energy band alignment and strengthened defect healing. This strategy, leveraging the spatial geometrical symmetry of the interface cations, promotes hole carrier extraction between functional layers and reduces nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. Consequently, perovskite solar cells processed with the symmetrical B(CE)A+ cations achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.60% and retain &#8776;91% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point operation. This work highlights the significant benefits of utilizing structurally symmetrical cations in promoting the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Optical Monitoring of Water Side Permeation in Thin Film Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a magnesium&#8208;based optical technique to quantify water permeation in thin film encapsulation, which becomes crucial as devices miniaturize. It highlights that design rules, robust interfacial interactions, and the use of high&#8208;barrier materials like silicon carbide significantly enhance the encapsulation's barrier effectiveness. This offers a novel approach to improving the durability of thin film coatings.








Abstract
The stability of long&#8208;term microfabricated implants is hindered by the presence of multiple water diffusion paths within artificially patterned thin&#8208;film encapsulations. Side permeation, defined as infiltration of molecules through the lateral surface of the thin structure, becomes increasingly critical with the trend of developing high&#8208;density and miniaturized neural electrodes. However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)&#8208;based method is proposed to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide&#8208;silicon carbide (PI&#8208;SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5&#8208;fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI&#8211;PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed. Increasing encapsulation's width (interelectrode spacing), creating stronger interfacial interactions, and integrating high&#8208;barrier interlayers such as SiC significantly enhance the lateral hermeticity.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal Linear Array Detector for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

A novel 329&#8208;type halide perovskite single crystal (SC) is developed by a new growth strategy, which shows&#160;significantly increased &#181;&#964; product. Therefore, the SC detectors achieve high detection sensitivity, fast response, and superior stability. In addition, the assembled SC linear array detector realizes high spatial resolution during X&#8208;ray imaging, which is expected to be a new&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection technology.








Abstract
0D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite is demonstrated as a promising semiconductor for X&#8208;ray detection due to its strong X&#8208;ray absorption, superior stability, availability of large single crystals (SCs) and solution processibility at low temperature. However, its low mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) limits its further improvement in detection sensitivity. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this work designs a new 2D Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite using a mixed&#8208;halide&#8208;induced structural dimension regulation strategy. By using a continuous supply of a precursor solution, this work successfully grows inch&#8208;sized high&#8208;quality SCs. These SCs exhibit large &#181;&#964; product, high resistivity, and low ion migration. The detectors fabricated using the SCs show X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity as high as 24,509 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, short response time of 315 &#181;s, low detection limit of 4.3 nGy s&#8722;1, and superior stability. These properties are the best among all lead&#8208;free perovskite detectors and are comparable to those of the best lead&#8208;based perovskite detectors. The linear array detector assembled on the SCs for the first time also shows a high spatial resolution of 10.6 lp mm&#8722;1 during X&#8208;ray imaging. The high performance combined with superior stability of these new 329&#8208;type lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCs is expected to promote a new generation of X&#8208;ray detection technologies.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low Modulus of Ductile TiZrHfTa Biomedical High&#8208;Entropy Alloys through Deformation Induced Martensitic Transformation/Twinning/Amorphization</title>

Simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, an excellent biocompatibility, and an acceptable ductility possess significant challenges in traditional biomedical alloys. This work presents a generic solution to an ever&#8208;lasting challenge in metal materials design: i.e., achieving low Young's modulus analogous to the human bone while maintaining commendable tensile ductility as well as excellent biocompatibility in a biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA).








Abstract
Biomedical alloys are paramount materials in biomedical applications, particularly in crafting biological artificial replacements. In traditional biomedical alloys, a significant challenge is simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and acceptable ductility. A multi&#8208;component body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA), which is composed of non&#8208;toxic elements, is noteworthy for its outstanding biocompatibility and compositional tuning capabilities. Nevertheless, the aforementioned challenges still remain. Here, a method to achieve a single phase with the lowest Young's modulus among the constituent phases by precisely tuning the stability of the BCC phase in the Bio&#8208;HEA, is proposed. The subtle tuning of the BCC phase stability also enables the induction of stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation with extremely low trigger stress. The transformation&#8208;induced plasticity and work hardening capacity are achieved via the stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation. Additionally, the hierarchical stress&#8208;induced martensite twin structure and crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation provide robust toughening mechanisms in the Bio&#8208;HEA. The cytotoxicity test confirms that this Bio&#8208;HEA exhibits excellent biocompatibility without cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the development of biomedical alloys with a combination of ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and decent ductility.

         <title>Engineering Anomalously Large Electron Transport in Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plisson, Yao, and coworkers uncover the key ingredients to enormous mobilities in topological semimetals. They prove fine&#8208;tuning of the phonon and electron dispersions leads to a phonon&#8211;electron fluid where momentum&#8208;conserving scattering dominates. This is done by combining DFT, transport, and Raman experiments.








Abstract
Anomalous transport of topological semimetals has generated significant interest for applications in optoelectronics, nanoscale devices, and interconnects. Understanding the origin of novel transport is crucial to engineering the desired material properties, yet their orders of magnitude higher transport than single&#8208;particle mobilities remain unexplained. This work demonstrates the dramatic mobility enhancements result from phonons primarily returning momentum to electrons due to phonon&#8208;electron dominating over phonon&#8211;phonon scattering. Proving this idea, proposed by Peierls in 1932, requires tuning electron and phonon dispersions without changing symmetry, topology, or disorder. This is achieved by combining de Haas &#8208; van Alphen (dHvA), electron transport, Raman scattering, and first&#8208;principles calculations in the topological semimetals MX2 (M = Nb, Ta and X = Ge, Si). Replacing Ge with Si brings the transport mobilities from an order magnitude larger than single particle ones to nearly balanced. This occurs without changing the crystal structure or topology and with small differences in disorder or Fermi surface. Simultaneously, Raman scattering and first&#8208;principles calculations establish phonon&#8211;electron dominated scattering only in the MGe2 compounds. Thus, this study proves that phonon&#8208;drag is crucial to the transport properties of topological semimetals and provides insight to engineer these materials&#160;further.

         <title>Atomic Scale Structure of Self&#8208;Assembled Lipidated Peptide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up theoretical approach is reported to produce the first atomically resolved experimentally consistent model of lipidated &#946;&#8208;peptide nanomaterials. The &#946;&#8208;peptide materials possess long&#8208;term mechanical and chemical stability in vivo, and may be easily decorated with combinations of different biological cues. This unique combination of properties is conducive to control over the resultant &#946;&#8208;peptide fiber morphology and biocompatibility,&#160;thus providing a substantial advantage over traditional &#945;&#8208;peptide&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Peptides have great potential as novel biomaterials and therapeutic agents, due to their unique&#160;ability to self&#8208;assemble into low dimensional nanostructures,&#160;and their resistance to enzymatic degradation&#160;in vivo. However, the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of &#946;&#8208;peptides, which possess increased flexibility due to the extra backbone methylene groups present within the constituent &#946;&#8208;amino acids, are not well understood due to inherent difficulties of observing their bottom&#8208;up growth pathway experimentally. A computational approach is presented for the bottom&#8208;up modelling of the self&#8208;assembled&#160;lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptides, from monomers, to oligomers, to supramolecular low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures, in all&#8208;atom detail. The approach is applied to elucidate the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of recently discovered, distinct structural morphologies of low dimensional nanomaterials, assembled from lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide monomers. The resultant structures of the nanobelts and the twisted fibrils are stable throughout subsequent unrestrained all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and these assemblies display good agreement with the structural features obtained from X&#8208;ray fiber diffraction and atomic force microscopy data.&#160;This is the first reported, fully&#8208;atomistic model of a lipidated &#946;3&#8208;peptide&#8208;based nanomaterial, and the computational approach developed here, in combination with experimental fiber diffraction analysis and atomic force microscopy, will be useful in elucidating the atomic scale structure of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based and other supramolecular nanomaterials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Stable Multiplexed Biosensors Array in Fully Printed and Integrated Platforms for Reliable Perspiration Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully inkjet&#8208;printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch that exhibits ultra&#8208;high stability and sensitivity. These desirable properties are enabled by the precise control over the active materials mass loading and the unique interpenetrating interfaces, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as one of the promising tools for tracking human body physiological dynamics via non&#8208;invasive perspiration analysis. However, it remains a key challenge to integrate multiplexed sensors in a highly controllable and reproducible manner to achieve long&#8208;term reliable biosensing, especially on flexible platforms. Herein, a fully inkjet printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch with remarkably high stability and sensitivity is reported for the first time. These desirable characteristics are enabled by the unique interpenetrating interface design and precise control over active materials mass loading, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes. The sensors deliver sensitivities of 313.28&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for glucose and 0.87&#160;&#181;A mm&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for alcohol sensing with minimal drift over 30 h, which are among the best in the literature. The integrated patch can be used for reliable and wireless diet monitoring or medical intervention via epidermal analysis and would inspire the advances of wearable devices for intelligent healthcare applications.

         <title>Trichome&#8208;Like Biomimetic Air Filters via Templated Silicone Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of plant&#8208;based purification, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with three dimensional (3D)&#8208;templated silicon nanofilaments formed in situ onto preset template substrates with an average diameter of &#8776;74 nm are proposed based on a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, demonstrating extraordinary filtration performance.








Abstract
Air pollution threats to human health have increased awareness of the role of filter units in air cleaning applications. As an ideal energy&#8208;saving strategy for air filters, the slip effect on nanofiber surfaces can potentially overcome the trade&#8208;off between filtration efficiency and pressure drop. However, the potential of the slip effect in nanofibrous structures is significantly limited by the tight nanofiber stacks. In this study, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with 3D&#8208;templated silicone nanofilaments (average diameter: &#8776;74 nm) are prepared based on an in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method inspired by plant purification. Theoretical modeling and experimental results indicate that TLB air filters make significant use of the slip effect to overcome the efficiency&#8208;resistance tradeoff. The selectable filter class (up to U15, &#8776;99.9995%) allows TLB air filters to meet various requirements, and their integral filtration performance surpasses that of most commodity air filters, including melt&#8208;blown cloth, ePTFE membranes, electrospun mats, and glass fiber paper. The proposed strategy directly transforms commercial filter media and filters into TLB air filters using a bottom&#8208;up, one&#8208;step approach. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, reusable N95 respirators and air purifiers equipped with TLB air filters are fabricated, overcoming the limitations of existing filter designs and fabrication methods.

         <title>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
At room temperature, quasi&#8211;1D chalcogenide crystal BaTiS3 shows structural disorder due to off&#8211;centering Ti displacements along the ab&#8211;plane that is perpendicular to the long axis. These disordered Ti displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8211;plane and result in a giant enhancement of optical anisotropy. Thus, structural disorder provides a new degree&#8211;of&#8211;freedom for light manipulation in photonic applications.








Abstract
It is shown that structural disorder&#8212;in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements&#8212;modulates the refractive index tensor and results in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS3, a quasi&#8208;1D hexagonal chalcogenide. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS6 chains along the c&#8208;axis, and threefold degenerate Ti displacements in the a&#8211;b plane. 47/49Ti solid&#8208;state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three&#8208;horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the Ti a&#8211;b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8208;plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS3, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.

     alt="Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At room temperature, quasi&#8211;1D chalcogenide crystal BaTiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows structural disorder due to off&#8211;centering Ti displacements along the ab&#8211;plane that is perpendicular to the long axis. These disordered Ti displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab&#8211;plane and result in a giant enhancement of optical anisotropy. Thus, structural disorder provides a new degree&#8211;of&#8211;freedom for light manipulation in photonic applications.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;Scale 2D CrTe2 Films on Amorphous Silicon Wafers With Low Thermal Budget</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded growth technique is developed for crystallizing large&#8208;scale 2D CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si substrates with a low thermal budget. Grain boundaries, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and magnetic&#8211;electrical behavior of 2D CrTe2 magnets are controlled through crystallinity engineering. This work paves the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magneto&#8211;electronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets open landmark horizons in the development of innovative spintronic device architectures. However, their fabrication with large scale poses challenges due to high synthesis temperatures (&gt;500 &#176;C) and difficulties in integrating them with standard complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology on amorphous substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiNx). Here, a seeded growth technique for crystallizing CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si and SiO2/Si substrates with a low thermal budget is presented. This fabrication process optimizes large&#8208;scale, granular atomic layers on amorphous substrates, yielding a substantial coercivity of 11.5 kilo&#8208;oersted, attributed to weak intergranular exchange coupling. Field&#8208;driven N&#233;el&#8208;type stripe domain dynamics explain the amplified coercivity. Moreover, the granular CrTe2 devices on Si wafers display significantly enhanced magnetoresistance, more than doubling that of single&#8208;crystalline counterparts. Current&#8208;assisted magnetization switching, enabled by a substantial spin&#8211;orbit torque with a large spin Hall angle (85) and spin Hall conductivity (1.02 &#215; &#8201;107 &#8463;/2e&#8201; &#937;&#8315;&#185;&#8201; m&#8315;&#185;), is also demonstrated. These observations underscore the proficiency in manipulating crystallinity within integrated 2D magnetic films on Si wafers, paving the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magnetoelectronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.

         <title>Topologically Protected Quantum Logic Gates with Valley&#8208;Hall Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, He et&#160;al. provide a scheme to experimentally realize the topologically protected quantum logic gates, including control&#8208;NOT and Hadamard gates, on the silicon photonic platform. These quantum gates not only have high experimental fidelities but also exhibit a certain degree of tolerances against certain types of defects, which paves the way for future optical quantum computations.








Abstract
Topological photonics provide a promising way to realize more robust optical devices against some defects and environmental perturbations. Quantum logic gates are fundamental units of quantum computers, which are widely used in future quantum information processing. Thus, constructing robust universal quantum logic gates is an important way forward to practical quantum computing. However, the most important problem to be solved is how to construct the quantum&#8208;logic&#8208;gate&#8208;required 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 beam splitter with topological protection. Here, the experimental realization of the topologically protected contradirectional coupler is reported, which can be employed to realize the quantum logic gates, including control&#8208;NOT and Hadamard gates, on the silicon photonic platform. These quantum gates not only have high experimental fidelities but also exhibit a certain degree of tolerances against certain types of defects. This work paves the way for the development of practical optical quantum computations and signal processing.

Non&#8208;volatile floating&#8208;gate memory devices with all functional layers made of 2D materials with atomically sharp interface, including MoS2 channel layer, hBN tunnel layer, multilayer graphene (MLG) floating&#8208;gate layer, hBN block layer and MLG control gate layer, can be ultrafastly programmed/erased in &#8776;20&#160;ns with high extinction ratios (up to 108) and long&#8208;term retention characteristics.








Abstract
The explosive growth of massive&#8208;data storage and the demand for ultrafast data processing require innovative memory devices with exceptional performance. 2D materials and their van der Waal heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces hold great promise for innovations in memory devices. Here, this work presents non&#8208;volatile, floating&#8208;gate memory devices with all functional layers made of 2D materials, achieving ultrafast programming/erasing speeds (20&#160;ns), high extinction ratios (up to 108), and multi&#8208;bit storage capability. These devices also exhibit long&#8208;term data retention exceeding 10 years, facilitated by a high gate&#8208;coupling ratio (GCR) and atomically sharp interfaces between functional layers. Additionally, this work demonstrates the realization of an &#8220;OR&#8221; logic gate on a single&#8208;device unit by synergistic electrical and optical operations. The present results provide a solid foundation for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;speed, ultralong lifespan, non&#8208;volatile memory devices, with a potential for scale&#8208;up manufacturing and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Efficient Delivery of Lomitapide using Hybrid Membrane&#8208;Coated Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructures for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a biomimetic nanodrug delivery system, RFA nanoparticles is constructed, which takes into account long&#8208;term circulation within the bloodstream and drug&#8208;carrying function, and can combine active targeting and immune escape to deliver lomitapide stably targeted to the cancer cells behind the blood&#8208;brain barrier, which achieved efficient, stable and safe drug therapy for glioblastoma.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds are screened based on a high&#8208;throughput drug screening platform and a novel anti&#8208;GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP) is obtained. Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM is constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate&#8208;modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results show that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti&#8208;GBM activities, reduced off&#8208;target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan, and has negligible side effects in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study combines high&#8208;throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a biomimetic nanodrug delivery system, RFA nanoparticles is constructed, which takes into account long-term circulation within the bloodstream and drug-carrying function, and can combine active targeting and immune escape to deliver lomitapide stably targeted to the cancer cells behind the blood-brain barrier, which achieved efficient, stable and safe drug therapy for glioblastoma.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Traditional chemotherapy has poor therapeutic effects and significant side effects due to drug resistance, the natural blood-brain barrier (BBB), and nonspecific distribution, leading to a lack of clinically effective therapeutic drugs. Here, 1430 small molecule compounds are screened based on a high-throughput drug screening platform and a novel anti-GBM drug, lomitapide (LMP) is obtained. Furthermore, a bionic nanodrug delivery system (RFA NPs) actively targeting GBM is constructed, which mainly consists of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (tFNA NPs) loaded with LMP as the core and a folate-modified erythrocyte&#8211;cancer cell&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (FRUR) as the shell. FRUR camouflage conferred unique features on tFNA NPs, including excellent biocompatibility, improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficient BBB permeability, and tumor targeting ability. The results show that the LMP RFA NPs exhibited superior and specific anti-GBM activities, reduced off-target drug delivery, prolonged lifespan, and has negligible side effects in tumor-bearing mice. This study combines high-throughput drug screening with biomimetic nanodrug delivery system technology to provide a theoretical and practical basis for drug development and the optimization of clinical treatment strategies for GBM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Hyperspectral Holography Enabled by Inverse&#8208;Designed Metasurfaces with Oblique Helicoidal Cholesterics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic hyperspectral holography is experimentally demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal. The inverse design enables high information capacity of the multicolor holography and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal provides precise and tunable spectral modulation. As a proof of concept, the optical secret&#8208;sharing platform is demonstrated.









Abstract
Metasurfaces are flat arrays of nanostructures that allow exquisite control of phase and amplitude of incident light. Although metasurfaces offer new active element for both fundamental science and applications, the challenge still remains to overcome their low information capacity and passive nature. Here, by integrating an inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface with oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH), simultaneous spatial and spectral tunable metasurfaces with a high information capacity for dynamic hyperspectral holography, are demonstrated. The inverse design facilitates a single&#8208;phase map encoding of ten independent holographic images at different wavelengths. ChOH provides precise spectral modulation with narrow bandwidth and wide tunable regime in response to programmed stimuli, thus enabling dynamic switching of the multicolor holography. The results provide simple and generalizable principles for the rational design of interactive metasurfaces that will find numerous applications, including security platform.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel Sealant for Gastrointestinal Wound Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
GastroShield, an sprayable adhesive hydrogel, offers a novel solution to postoperative gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Utilizing polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic and oxidized dextran, the hydrogel forms an instant, durable shield upon application via endoscopic spray, proven safe and effective in multiple animal models. This hydrogel uses a new approach for GI wound care, decreasing postoperative complications such as bleeding and perforation. 








Abstract
Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, such as polyp resection post&#8208;colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8211;7 days) post&#8208;operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra&#8208; and post&#8208;procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short&#8208;term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 h). In this study, a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions is developed using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. The authors' findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8211;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications. Overall, this technology offers a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in an Insulating van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a skyrmion lattice in van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 opens pathways for exploration of topological spin textures in 2D insulating crystals. These skyrmions manifest in unusual crystalline environment characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structure and are stabilized through dipolar rather than Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The construction of B&#8208;T phase diagram enables versatile phase&#8208;switching mechanisms for controlling magnetization textures.








Abstract
Generation and control of topological spin textures constitutes one of the most exciting challenges of modern spintronics given their potential applications in information storage technologies. Of particular interest are magnetic insulators, which due to low damping, absence of Joule heating and reduced dissipation can provide energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;textures platform. Here, it is demonstrated that the interplay between sample thickness, external magnetic fields, and optical excitations can generate a prolific paramount of spin textures, and their coexistence in insulating CrBr3 van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. Using high&#8208;resolution magnetic force microscopy and large&#8208;scale micromagnetic simulation methods, the existence of a large region in T&#8208;B phase diagram is demonstrated where different stripe domains, skyrmion crystals, and magnetic domains exist and can be intrinsically selected or transformed to each&#8208;other via a phase&#8208;switch mechanism. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy unveils the mixed chirality of the magnetic textures that are of Bloch&#8208;type at given conditions but can be further manipulated into N&#233;el&#8208;type or hybrid&#8208;type via thickness&#8208;engineering. The topological phase transformation between the different magnetic objects can be further inspected by standard photoluminescence optical probes resolved by circular polarization indicative of an existence of exciton&#8208;skyrmion coupling mechanism. The findings identify vdW magnetic insulators as a promising framework of materials for the manipulation and generation of highly ordered skyrmion lattices relevant for device integration at the atomic level.

         <title>Concurrent Ammonia Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation Boosted by Glutathione&#8208;Capped Quantum Dots under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the protein environment for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process, glutathione&#8208;capped quantum dot is designed to accomplish efficient, selective, and scalable ammonia and ketone synthesis via NOx&#8722; reduction and alcohol oxidation concurrently under visible light. The positively&#8208;shifted surface charge and cogenerating GS&#183;and H&#183; radicals facilitate balanced electron and hole utilization, offering promising synthetic potential of value&#8208;added nitrogenous chemicals.








Abstract
Mother nature accomplishes efficient ammonia synthesis via cascade N2 oxidation by lightning strikes followed with enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen oxyanion (NOx&#8722;, x = 2,3) reduction. The protein environment of enzymatic centers for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process greatly inspires the design of glutathione&#8208;capped (GSH) quantum dots (QDs) for ammonia synthesis under visible light (440&#160;nm) in tandem with plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation. Mechanistic studies reveal that GSH induces positive shift of surface charge to strengthen the interaction between NOx&#8722; and QDs. Upon visible light irradiation of QDs, the balanced and rapid hole and electron transfer furnish GS&#183;radicals for 2e&#8722;/2H+ alcohol oxidation and H&#183;for 8e&#8722;/10H+ NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ reduction simultaneously. For the first time, mmol&#8208;scale ammonia synthesis is realized with apparent quantum yields of 5.45% &#177; 0.64%, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of value&#8208;added acetophenone and NH4Cl proceeds with 1:4 stoichiometry and stability, demonstrating promising multielectron and multiproton ammonia synthesis efficiency and sustainability with nature&#8208;inspired artificial photocatalysts.

Upon visible light irradiation of QDs, the balanced and rapid hole and electron transfer furnish GS&#183;radicals for 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alcohol oxidation and H&#183;for 8e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/10H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

For the first time, mmol-scale ammonia synthesis is realized with apparent quantum yields of 5.45% &#177; 0.64%, and gram-scale synthesis of value-added acetophenone and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl proceeds with 1:4 stoichiometry and stability, demonstrating promising multielectron and multiproton ammonia synthesis efficiency and sustainability with nature-inspired artificial photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imaging the Breakdown and Restoration of Topological Protection in Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant exchange gap fluctuation has been discovered in a five&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin film using scanning tunneling microscopy. By applying a 1T out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, the gap fluctuation can be reduced. These findings provide valuable insight into the breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), revealing that magnetic disorder in odd&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 thin films must be overcome in order to realize QAHE at higher temperatures.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators transport charge without resistance along topologically protected chiral 1D edge states. Yet, in magnetic topological insulators to date, topological protection is far from robust, with zero&#8208;magnetic field QAH effect only realized at temperatures an order of magnitude below the N&#233;el temperature TN, though small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological protection breaks down is therefore essential to realizing QAH effect at higher temperatures. Here a scanning tunneling microscope is used to directly map the size of exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH insulator 5&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4. Long&#8208;range fluctuations of Eg,ex are observed, with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, appearing to be uncorrelated to individual surface point defects. The breakdown of topological protection is directly imaged, showing that the gapless edge state, the hallmark signature of a QAH insulator, hybridizes with extended gapless regions in the bulk. Finally, it is unambiguously demonstrated that the gapless regions originate from magnetic disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields. The results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is the key to exploiting the unique properties of QAH insulators.

         <title>Electrically Controlled All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions on Silicon with Large Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions featuring both electrical switching by spin&#8211;orbit torque, and electrical readout of their antiferromagnetic state by a large room&#8208;temperature tunnel magnetoresistance effect are reported. The devices are based on noncollinear antiferromagnetic PtMn3 and are sputter&#8208;deposited on silicon. These results pave the path toward realizing antiferromagnetic memory and high&#8208;frequency devices integrated on established semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are a pathway to spintronic memory and computing devices with unprecedented speed, energy efficiency, and bit density. Realizing this potential requires AFM devices with simultaneous electrical writing and reading of information, which are also compatible with established silicon&#8208;based manufacturing. Recent experiments have shown tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) readout in epitaxial AFM tunnel junctions. However, these TMR structures are not grown using a silicon&#8208;compatible deposition process, and controlling their AFM order required external magnetic fields. Here are shown three&#8208;terminal AFM tunnel junctions based on the noncollinear antiferromagnet PtMn3, sputter&#8208;deposited on silicon. The devices simultaneously exhibit electrical switching using electric currents, and electrical readout by a large room&#8208;temperature TMR effect. First&#8208;principles calculations explain the TMR in terms of the momentum&#8208;resolved spin&#8208;dependent tunneling conduction in tunnel junctions with noncollinear AFM electrodes.

         <title>Moir&#233; Pattern Controlled Phonon Polarizer Based on Twisted Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, thermal experiment&#160;in twisted graphene is reported, measuring Moir&#233; angle&#8208;depedent thermal conductance and revealing fundamental relationship between twist angles and phonon behaviors. As revealed by experimental measurements and atomistic calculations, the dominant tuning mechanisms for tuning phonon transmission stem from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into mode&#8208;depedent&#160;thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.








Abstract
Twisted van der Waals materials featuring Moir&#233; patterns present new design possibilities and demonstrate unconventional behaviors in electrical, optical, spintronic, and superconducting properties. However, experimental exploration of thermal transport across Moir&#233; patterns has not been as extensive, despite its critical role in nanoelectronics, thermal management, and energy technologies. Here, the&#160;first experimental study is conducted on thermal transport across twisted graphene, demonstrating a phonon polarizer concept from the rotational misalignment between stacked layers. The direct thermal and acoustic measurements,&#160;structural characterizations, and atomistic modeling, reveal a modulation up to 631% in thermal conductance with various Moir&#233; angles, while maintaining a high acoustic transmission. By comparing experiments with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, mode&#8208;dependent phonon transmissions are quantified based on the angle alignment of graphene band structures and attributed to the coupling among flexural phonon modes. The agreement confirms the dominant tuning mechanisms in adjusting phonon transmission from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while having negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into the fundamental thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum thermal devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Perylene Diimide Trimer Material for N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of creating air&#8208;stable small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors is reported with helical perylene&#8208;diimide trimer (hPDI[3]) as the model material. Alkyl sidechains are grafted onto the molecular semiconductors to increase its thin&#8208;film solution processability, then removed to create films with better ion transport and stability. High&#8208;transconductance organic electrochemical transistors are made with side&#8208;chainless hPDI[3] as the active material.








Abstract
A new method is reported to make air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor (OMIEC) films for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) using a solution&#8208;processable small molecule helical perylene diimide trimer, hPDI[3]&#8208;C11. Alkyl side chains are attached to the conjugated core for processability and film making, which are then cleaved via thermal annealing. After the sidechains are removed, the hPDI[3] film becomes less hydrophobic, more ordered, and has a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). These features provide improved ionic transport, greater electronic mobility, and increased stability in air and in aqueous solution. Subsequently, hPDI[3]&#8208;H is used as the active material in OECTs and a device with a transconductance of 44 mS, volumetric capacitance of &#8776;250 F cm&#8722;3, &#181;C* value of 1 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and excellent stability (&gt; 5 weeks) is demonstrated. As proof of their practical applications, a hPDI[3]&#8208;H&#8208;based OECTs as a glucose sensor and electrochemical inverter is utilized. The approach of side chain removal after film formation charts a path to a wide range of molecular semiconductors to be used as stable, mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Control of Arsenic Incorporation in Silicon for High&#8208;Yield Artificial Lattice Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single arsenic atoms are deterministically incorporated into a silicon lattice with up to 100% yield. This is achieved using arsine gas as a precursor to arsenic incorporation via scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography. A detailed understanding of the surface chemistry of arsine on lithographically patterned hydrogen&#8208;terminated Si(001) underpins the fabrication of a 2 &#215; 2 single&#8208;atom arsenic artificial lattice.








Abstract
Artificial lattices constructed from individual dopant atoms within a semiconductor crystal hold promise to provide novel materials with tailored electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. These custom&#8208;engineered lattices are anticipated to enable new, fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics and lead to the creation of new semiconductor technologies including analog quantum simulators and universal solid&#8208;state quantum computers. This work reports precise and repeatable, substitutional incorporation of single arsenic atoms into a silicon lattice. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography and a detailed statistical exploration of the chemistry of arsine on the hydrogen&#8208;terminated silicon (001) surface are employed to show that single arsenic dopants can be deterministically placed within four silicon lattice sites and incorporated with 97 &#177; 2% yield. These findings bring closer to the ultimate frontier in semiconductor technology: the deterministic assembly of atomically precise dopant and qubit arrays at arbitrarily large scales.

         <title>Fast Na+ Kinetics and Suppressed Voltage Hysteresis Enabled by a High&#8208;Entropy Strategy for Sodium Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy configuration within transition metal slabs helps to strengthen TMO2 skeleton and enlarge the sodium ion diffusion channel, which promotes fast Na+ kinetics, reversible TM redox and phase transition as well as decreased voltage hysteresis, thus achieving impressive electrochemical performance for sodium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na+ diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, this work proposes a high&#8208;entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verify that high&#8208;entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3&#8211;P3&#8211;O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na+ diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3&#8208;Na0.9Ni0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Mn0.2Ti0.15Cu0.05O2 material with high&#8208;entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (&lt;0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na+ diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>2D Catalytic Nanozyme Enables Cascade Enzyodynamic Effect&#8208;Boosted and Ca2+ Overload&#8208;Induced Synergistic Ferroptosis/Apoptosis in Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets with five enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities are rationally designed, engineered, and developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ overload for ferroptosis/apoptosis synergistic therapy of lung cancer.








Abstract
The introduction of glucose oxidase, exhibiting characteristics of glucose consumption and H2O2 production, represents an emerging antineoplastic therapeutic approach that disrupts nutrient supply and promotes efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the instability of natural enzymes and their low therapeutic efficacy significantly impede their broader application. In this context, 2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets (CMO NSs) designed and engineered to serve as a high&#8208;performance nanozyme, enhancing the enzyodynamic effect for a ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor therapy, are presented. In addition to mimicking activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, oxidase, and peroxidase, the engineered CMO NSs exhibit glucose oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities. This feature contributes to their antitumor performance through cascade catalytic reactions, involving the disruption of glucose supply, self&#8208;supply of H2O2, and subsequent efficient ROS generation. The exogenous Ca2+ released from CMO NSs, along with the endogenous Ca2+ enrichment induced by ROS from the peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of CMO NSs, collectively mediate Ca2+ overload, leading to apoptosis. Importantly, the ferroptosis process is triggered synchronously through ROS output and glutathione consumption. The application of exogenous ultrasound stimulation further enhances the efficiency of ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor treatment. This work underscores the crucial role of enzyodynamic performance in ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic therapy against tumors.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Charge Density Wave for Strongly Enhanced 2D Superconductivity in 1H&#8208;TaS2 Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3 &#215; 3 charge density wave (CDW) order and enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity (SC) are demonstrated in (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals superlattices, which exhibit monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics. The observed low&#8208;lying sulfur p band rearrangement implies a novel CDW driving force, providing new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and 2D SC in monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers offer a fertile platform for exploring unconventional Ising superconductivity (SC) and charge density waves (CDWs). However, the vulnerability of isolated monolayers to structural disorder and environmental oxidation often degrade their electronic coherence. Herein, an alternative approach is reported for fabricating stable and intrinsic monolayers of 1H&#8208;TaS2 sandwiched between SnS blocks in a (SnS)1.15TaS2 van der Waals (vdW) superlattice. The SnS block layers not only decouple individual 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers to endow them with monolayer&#8208;like electronic characteristics, but also protect the 1H&#8208;TaS2 layers from electronic degradation. The results reveal the characteristic 3 &#215; 3 CDW order in 1H&#8208;TaS2 sublayers associated with electronic rearrangement in the low&#8208;lying sulfur p band, which uncovers a previously undiscovered CDW mechanism rather than the conventional Fermi surface&#8208;related framework. Additionally, the (SnS)1.15TaS2 superlattice exhibits a strongly enhanced Ising&#8208;like SC with a layer&#8208;independent Tc of &#8776;3.0 K, comparable to that of the isolated monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 sample, presumably attributed to their monolayer&#8208;like characteristics and retained Fermi states. These results provide new insights into the long&#8208;debated CDW order and enhanced SC of monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2, establishing bulk vdW superlattices as promising platforms for investigating exotic collective quantum phases in the 2D limit.

Biocompatible and biodegradable 1D collagen nanofibers demonstrate excellent resistive switching properties. The collagen&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based device exhibits favorable resistive switching properties, showcasing voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior. The optimized device demonstrates reliable nonvolatile memory performance, mimicking biological synaptic learning, and displaying good biocompatibility and cytotoxicity properties. This underscores the potential of 1D collagen nanofibers for biocompatible and biodegradable electronics.








Abstract
Here, resistive switching (RS) devices are fabricated using naturally abundant, nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable biomaterials. For this purpose, 1D chitosan nanofibers (NFs), collagen NFs, and chitosan&#8211;collagen NFs are synthesized by using an electrospinning technique. Among different NFs, the collagen&#8208;NFs&#8208;based device shows promising RS characteristics. In particular, the optimized Ag/collagen NFs/fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide RS device shows a voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior and good nonvolatile memory properties. Moreover, it can also mimic various biological synaptic learning properties and can be used for pattern classification applications with the help of the spiking neural network. The time series analysis technique is employed to model and predict the switching variations of the RS device. Moreover, the collagen NFs have shown good cytotoxicity and anticancer properties, suggesting excellent biocompatibility as a switching layer. The biocompatibility of collagen NFs is explored with the help of NRK&#8208;52E (Normal Rat Kidney cell line) and MCF&#8208;7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation&#8208;7 cancer cell line). Additionally, the biodegradability of the device is evaluated through a physical transient test. This work provides a vital step toward developing a biocompatible and biodegradable switching material for sustainable nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Binary Solvent Induced Stable Interphase Layer for Ultra&#8208;Long Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, introducing 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) as a co&#8208;solvent to diglyme (Dig) leads to a more anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure even at low salt concentrations, thereby inducing a thin uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The thin, robust SEI layer formed can promote long&#8208;term stable electrochemical cycling of sodium metal anode, elucidating the critical role of anion stabilizing co&#8208;solvents for stable sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium foil, promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, faces reversibility challenges due to its inherent reactivity and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. In this study, a stable sodium metal battery (SMB) is achieved by tuning the electrolyte solvation structure through the addition of co&#8208;solvent 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) to diglyme (Dig). The introduction of cyclic ether&#8208;based MTHF results in increased anion incorporation in the solvation structure, even at lower salt concentrations. Specifically, the anion stabilization capabilities of the environmentally sustainable MTHF co&#8208;solvent lead to a contact&#8208;ion pair&#8208;based solvation structure. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy analysis reveals that a shift toward an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure promotes the formation of a thin and uniform SEI layer. Consequently, employing a NaPF6&#8208;based electrolyte with a Dig:MTHF ratio of 50% (v/v) binary solvent yields an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.72% for 300 cycles in Cu||Na cell cycling. Remarkably, at a C/2 cycling rate, Na||Na symmetric cell cycling demonstrates ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability exceeding 7000 h, and full cells with Na0.44MnO2 as a cathode retain 80% of their capacity after 500 cycles. This study systematically examines solvation structure, SEI layer composition, and electrochemical cycling, emphasizing the significance of MTHF&#8208;based binary solvent mixtures for high&#8208;performance SMBs.

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Robust Gel Electrolytes Built from A Charged Double Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) into a rigid&#8208;rod nanofibrillar polymer matrix forms a gel polymer electrolyte that has superior thermomechanical properties over poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), even when incorporating only 8% rigid&#8208;rod polymer. Lithium metal battery testing shows reversible cycling between discharging at ambient temperature and charging at 80&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C, enabling fast recharging and reduced thermal management for, e.g., electric vehicle batteries.








Abstract
Polymer electrolytes have received tremendous interest in the development of solid&#8208;state batteries, but often fall short in one or more key properties required for practical applications. Herein, a rigid gel polymer electrolyte prepared by immobilizing a liquid mixture of a lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether with only 8 wt% poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) is reported. The high charge density and rigid double helical structure of PBDT lead to formation of a nanofibrillar structure that endows this electrolyte with stronger mechanical properties, wider temperature window, and higher battery rate capability compared to all other poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. The ion transport mechanism in this rigid polymer electrolyte is systematically studied using multiple complementary techniques. Li/LiFePO4 cells show excellent capacity retention over long&#8208;term cycling, with thermal cycling reversibility between ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, demonstrating compelling potential for solid&#8208;state batteries targeting fast charging at high temperatures and slower discharging at ambient temperature.

         <title>Prevented Cell Clusters&#8217; Migration Via Microdot Biomaterials for Inhibiting Scar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles for inhibiting adhesion of injured tendon. By slowly releasing mitochondria&#8208;targeted functional polypeptides and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents in an inflammatory environment to promote the inflow of extracellular Ca2+, they can inhibit the N&#8208;cadherin expression and promote fibroblast apoptosis, synergistically inhibiting adhesion of injured tendons.








Abstract
Cluster&#8208;like collective cell migration of fibroblasts is one of the main factors of adhesion in injured tissues. In this research, a microdot biomaterial system is constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles, which are prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;N&#8208;carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) and lactide, respectively. The microdot biomaterial system slowly releases functionalized polypeptides targeting mitochondria and promoting the influx of extracellular calcium ions under the inflammatory environment, thus inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin mediating cell&#8211;cell interaction, and promoting apoptosis of cluster fibroblasts, synergistically inhibiting the migration of fibroblast clusters at the site of tendon injury. Meanwhile, the anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles are celecoxib (Cex) solubilized by PEG/polyester, which can improve the inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site for a long time. In vitro, the microdot biomaterial system can effectively inhibit the migration of the cluster fibroblasts by inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin between cell&#8211;cell and promoting apoptosis. In vivo, the microdot biomaterial system can promote apoptosis while achieving long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;inflammation effects, and reduce the expression of vimentin and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin (&#945;&#8208;SMA)&#160;in fibroblasts. Thus, this microdot biomaterial system provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of tendon adhesion by inhibiting the cluster migration of fibroblasts.

A locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque has been revealed and defined. A biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise motions along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling.








Abstract
Multimodal and controllable locomotion in complex terrain is of great importance for practical applications of insect&#8208;scale robots. Robust locomotion plays a particularly critical role. In this study, a locomotion mechanism for magnetic robots based on asymmetrical friction effect induced by magnetic torque is revealed and defined. The defined mechanism overcomes the design constraints imposed by both robot and substrate structures, enabling the realization of multimodal locomotion on complex terrains. Drawing inspiration from human walking and running locomotion, a biped robot based on the mechanism is proposed, which not only exhibits rapid locomotion across substrates with varying friction coefficients but also achieves precise locomotion along patterned trajectories through programmed controlling. Furthermore, apart from its exceptional locomotive capabilities, the biped robot demonstrates remarkable robustness in terms of load&#8208;carrying and weight&#8208;bearing performance. The presented locomotion and mechanism herein introduce a novel concept for designing magnetic robots while offering extensive possibilities for practical applications in insect&#8208;scale robotics.

         <title>In&#8208;Operando Spatiotemporal Imaging of Coupled Film&#8208;Substrate Elastodynamics During an Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising coherently coupled elastodynamics is observed between a VO2 film exhibiting an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) and a TiO2 substrate that &#160; also exhibits an IMT&#8208;like response in a micrometers deep surface layer, reveals by spatiotemporal X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy. Phase&#8208;field model points to native oxygen vacancy defects that respond to electric fields, a promising direction for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The drive toward non&#8208;von Neumann device architectures has led to an intense focus on insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal (IMT) and the converse metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator (MIT) transitions. Studies of electric field&#8208;driven IMT in the prototypical VO2 thin&#8208;film channel devices are largely focused on the electrical and elastic responses of the films, but the response of the corresponding TiO2 substrate is often overlooked, since it is nominally expected to be electrically passive and elastically rigid. Here, in&#8208;operando spatiotemporal imaging of the coupled elastodynamics using X&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy of a VO2 film channel device on TiO2 substrate reveals two new surprises. First, the film channel bulges during the IMT, the opposite of the expected shrinking in the film undergoing IMT. Second, a microns thick proximal layer in the substrate also coherently bulges accompanying the IMT in the film, which is completely unexpected. Phase&#8208;field simulations of coupled IMT, oxygen vacancy electronic dynamics, and electronic carrier diffusion incorporating thermal and strain effects suggest that the observed elastodynamics can be explained by the known naturally occurring oxygen vacancies that rapidly ionize (and deionize) in concert with the IMT (MIT). Fast electrical&#8208;triggering of the IMT via ionizing defects and an active &#8220;IMT&#8208;like&#8221; substrate layer are critical aspects to consider in device applications.

         <title>Reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Bis(hydroxymethyl)Furan at High Current Density using a Ga&#8208;Doped AgCu:Cationomer Hybrid Electrocatalyst</title>

Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and chemicals. A direct electroreduction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) has been developed using a hybrid catalyst. The utilization of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationomer achieves a BHMF faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and valorized chemicals. Thermochemical processes for biomass reduction typically employ hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperatures and pressures. Here, the authors investigate the direct electrified reduction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to a precursor to bio&#8208;polymers, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Noting a limited current density in prior reports of this transformation, a hybrid catalyst consisting of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationic ionomer, the latter purposed to increase local pH and facilitate surface proton diffusion, is investigated. This approach, when implemented using Ga&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Cu electrocatalysts designed for p&#8211;d orbital hybridization, steered selectivity to BHMF, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, the latter a doubling in rate compared to the best prior reports.

         <title>Facile Access to High Solid Content Monodispersed Microspheres via Dual&#8208;Component Surfactants Regulation toward High&#8208;Performance Colloidal Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;surfactants&#8208;mediated emulsion polymerization mechanism is proposed, where anionic and nonionic surfactants are employed due to their synergistic effect to guarantee the electrostatic and steric dual&#8208;stabilization balance. Thus, 55&#160;wt% high solid content poly(styrene&#8208;butyl acrylate&#8208;methacrylic acid) monodispersed colloidal latex is achieved, which can be used to construct metamaterials toward photoluminescence enhancement and passive cooling coatings.








Abstract
Monodispersed microspheres play a major role in optical science and engineering, providing ideal building blocks for structural color materials. However, the method toward high solid content (HSC) monodispersed microspheres has remained a key hurdle. Herein, a facile access to harvest monodispersed microspheres based on the emulsion polymerization mechanism is demonstrated, where anionic and nonionic surfactants are employed to achieve the electrostatic and steric dual&#8208;stabilization balance in a synergistic manner. Monodispersed poly(styrene&#8208;butyl acrylate&#8208;methacrylic acid) colloidal latex with 55&#160;wt% HSC is achieved, which shows an enhanced self&#8208;assembly efficiency of 280% compared with the low solid content (10&#160;wt%) latex. In addition, Ag&#8208;coated colloidal photonic crystal (Ag@CPC) coating with near&#8208;zero refractive index is achieved, presenting the characteristics of metamaterials. And an 11&#8208;fold photoluminescence emission enhancement of CdSe@ZnS quantum dots is realized by the Ag@CPC metamaterial coating. Taking advantage of high assembly efficiency, easily large&#8208;scale film&#8208;forming of the 55&#160;wt% HSC microspheres latex, robust Ag@CPC metamaterial coatings could be easily produced for passive cooling. The coating demonstrates excellent thermal insulation performance with theoretical cooling power of 30.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, providing practical significance for scalable CPC architecture coatings in passive cooling.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Atomic Order on Double&#8208;Stepped Al2O3(0001) Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely well&#8208;ordered surface is obtained by annealing sapphire (0001) substrates at ultrahigh temperatures. Electron diffraction reveals micrometer&#8208;scale atomic order on these surfaces. This order opens new avenues for engineering thin&#8208;film quality and harnessing the unique properties of advanced materials. A highly advantageous combination of material properties &#8208; ionic bonding character, high&#8208;temperature stability, and polar step edges &#8208; underlies the observed order.








Abstract
The deterministic preparation of highly ordered single&#8208;crystalline surfaces is a key step for studying and utilizing the physical properties of various advanced materials. This paper presents the fast and straightforward preparation of vicinal Al2O3(0001) surfaces with micrometer&#8208;scale atomic order. Crisp electron&#8208;diffraction spots up to at least 20th order evidence atomic coherence on terraces with widths exceeding 1 &#956;m. The unique combination of three properties of Al2O3(0001) underlie this remarkable coherence: its high&#8208;temperature stability; the differences in the ionic bonding systems of the surface as compared to the bulk; and the fact that the terraces are non&#8208;polar whereas the step edges have a polar character. The step edges are furthermore found to have alternating configurations, which drive a step&#8208;doubling transition. On double&#8208;stepped surfaces, the Al&#8208;rich (31&#215;31)R&#177;9$(\sqrt {31}\times \sqrt {31})\textrm {R}\pm 9$&#176; surface reconstruction attains a singular in&#8208;plane orientation.

     alt="Long-Range Atomic Order on Double-Stepped Al2O3(0001) Surfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extremely well-ordered surface is obtained by annealing sapphire (0001) substrates at ultrahigh temperatures. Electron diffraction reveals micrometer-scale atomic order on these surfaces. This order opens new avenues for engineering thin-film quality and harnessing the unique properties of advanced materials. A highly advantageous combination of material properties - ionic bonding character, high-temperature stability, and polar step edges - underlies the observed order.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deterministic preparation of highly ordered single-crystalline surfaces is a key step for studying and utilizing the physical properties of various advanced materials. This paper presents the fast and straightforward preparation of vicinal Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(0001) surfaces with micrometer-scale atomic order. Crisp electron-diffraction spots up to at least 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order evidence atomic coherence on terraces with widths exceeding 1 &#956;m. The unique combination of three properties of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(0001) underlie this remarkable coherence: its high-temperature stability; the differences in the ionic bonding systems of the surface as compared to the bulk; and the fact that the terraces are non-polar whereas the step edges have a polar character. The step edges are furthermore found to have alternating configurations, which drive a step-doubling transition. On double-stepped surfaces, the Al-rich (31&#215;31)R&#177;9$(\sqrt {31}\times \sqrt {31})\textrm {R}\pm 9$&#176; surface reconstruction attains a singular in-plane orientation. These results set a benchmark for high-quality surface preparation and thus expand the scope for both fundamental studies on and the technological utilization of exciting material&#160;systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Acoustic Beamshaping with Coupling&#8208;Immune Moir&#233; Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces are proposed by leveraging the interlayer coupling from propagating waves. Remote acoustic moir&#233; effects are theoretically and experimentally validated to be decoupled from the interlayer distance. The dynamic shaping of acoustic beams and vortices is successfully achieved, facilitating twisted moir&#233; devices of practical applications in remote dynamic detection and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication.








Abstract
Moir&#233; effects arising from mutually twisted metasurfaces have showcased remarkable wave manipulation capabilities, unveiling tantalizing emerging phenomena such as acoustic moir&#233; flat bands and topological phase transitions. However, the pursuit of strong near&#8208;field coupling in layers has necessitated acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces to be tightly stacked at narrow distances in the subwavelength range. Here, moir&#233; effects beyond near&#8208;field interlayer coupling in acoustics are reported and the concept of coupling&#8208;immune moir&#233; metasurfaces is proposed. Remote acoustic moir&#233; effects decoupled from the interlayer distance are theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrated. Tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane acoustic beam scanning is successfully achieved by dynamically controlling twist angles. The engineered coupling&#8208;immune properties are further extended to multilayered acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces and manipulation of acoustic vortices. Good robustness against external disturbances is also observed for the fabricated coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces. The presented work unlocks the potential of twisted moir&#233; devices for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane acoustic beam shaping, enabling practical applications in remote dynamic detection, and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication.

         <title>Anchoring Active Li Metal in Oriented Channel by In Situ Formed Nucleation Sites Enabling Durable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A vertical carbon vascular tissue preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles (VCVT/CoSe) host is designed for dendrite&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries. This Li host provides speedy Li+ transport channels and abundant lithiophilic sites guiding Li deposition behavior with uniform morphology, which ensure stable cycling capability over 3000 h and high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles in full&#8208;cell paired with a nickel&#8208;rich cathode.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the ultimate anode material for pursuing the increased energy density of rechargeable batteries. However, fatal dendrites growth and huge volume change seriously hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, a lithium host that preinstalled CoSe nanoparticles on vertical carbon vascular tissues (VCVT/CoSe) is designed and fabricated to resolve these issues, which provides sufficient Li plating space with a robust framework, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. Their inherent N sites coupled with the in situ formed lithiophilic Co sites loaded at the interface of VCVT not only anchor the initial Li nucleation seeds but also accelerate the Li+ transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the Li2Se originated from the CoSe conversion contributes to constructing a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with high ionic conductivity. This optimized Li/VCVT/CoSe composite anode exhibits a prominent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#160;h with a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a commercial nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathode, the full&#8208;cell presents substantially enhanced cycling performance with 81.7% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Thus, this work reveals the critical role of guiding Li deposition behavior to maintain homogeneous Li morphology and pave the way to stable LMBs.

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Mode Random Lasing of Tin Halide Perovskites Integrated in a Vertical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the tuning of the Random Lasing (RL) characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed, while single&#8208;mode RL is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy.








Abstract
The development of random lasing (RL) with predictable and controlled properties is an important step to make these cheap optical sources stable and reliable. However, the design of tailored RL characteristics (emission energy, threshold, number of modes) is only obtained with complex photonic structures, while the simplest optical configurations able to tune the RL are still a challenge. This work demonstrates the tuning of the RL characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity with low quality factor. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed. More importantly, single mode RL operation with the lowest threshold and a quality factor as high as 1&#160;000 (twenty times the quality factor of the resonator) is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy due to higher gain. These results can have important technological implications toward the development of low&#8208;cost RL sources without chaotic behavior.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Microsensors Inspired by Noctiluca Scintillans for Small&#8208;Defect Positioning and Electrical&#8208;Stress Visualization in Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by noctiluca scintillans for addressing the critical need to visualize small defects and electrical stress in dielectric polymers. The SRM couples nearby electric field energy to emit measurable fluorescence, presenting a distinct distribution of invisible electric field in polymers for the first time.








Abstract
Small defects induce concentrated electrical stress in dielectric polymers, leading to premature failure of materials. Existing sensing methods fail to effectively visualize these defects owing to the invisible&#8208;energy state of the electric field. Thus, it is necessary to establish a nondestructive method for the real&#8208;time detection of small defects in dielectric polymers. In this study, a self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by Noctiluca scintillans is designed to endow materials with the ability of self&#8208;detection for defects and electrical stress. The SRM leverages the energy of a nearby electric field to emit measurable fluorescence, enabling defect localization and diagnosis as well as electrical&#8208;stress visualization. A controllable dielectric microsphere is constructed to achieve an adjustable electroluminescence threshold for the SRM, thereby increasing its detection accuracy while decreasing the electroluminescence threshold. The potential degradation in the polymer performance owing to SRM implantation is addressed by assembling long molecular chains on the SRM surface to spontaneously generate an interpenetrating network. Results of finite element analyses and experiments demonstrate that the SRM can effectively realize nondestructive visualization and positioning of small defects and concentrated electrical stress in polymers, positioning it as a promising sensing method for monitoring the electric field and charge distribution in materials.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Ultrathin Perfect Absorber for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the cornea of the compound crab eye, an ultrathin perfect absorber with strong light&#8208;absorption and mechanical stability is proposed. A strong absorption (87%) is realized at subwavelength cross&#8208;section thickness (1/20 of the wavelength), which enables high&#8208;temperature hot&#8208;electron pumping. The absorber is promising for applications in advanced energy, catalysis, and photodetection.








Abstract
Ultrathin perfect absorber (UPA) enables efficient photothermal conversion (PC) in renewable chemical and energy systems. However, it is challenging so far to obtain efficient absorption with thickness significantly less than the wavelength, especially considering the common view that an ultrathin film can absorb at most 50% of incident light. Here, a highly light&#8208;absorbing and mechanically stable UPA is reported by learning from the honeycomb mirror design of the crab compound eyes. With the hollow apertures enclosed by the self&#8208;supporting ultrathin film of reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles, the absorber achieves spoof&#8208;plasmon enhanced broadband absorption in solar spectrum and low radiative decay in infrared. Specifically, a strong absorption (87%) is realized by the apertures with cross&#8208;section thickness of 1/20 of the wavelength, which is 7.3 times stronger than a planar counterpart with the identical material. Its high PC efficiency up to 64%, with hot&#8208;electron temperature as high as 2344&#8201;K, is also experimentally demonstrated. Utilizing its low thermal mass nature, a high&#8208;speed visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared converter is constructed. The absorber can enable high&#8208;performance PC processes for future interfacial catalysis and photon&#8208;detection.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multishelled ferromagnetic material with controllable shell numbers is presented. By strategically regulating the nanoscale intershell magnetic interactions, the magnetic properties of each shell are fine&#8208;tuned. This approach has revealed distinctive magnetic characteristics including regulated magnetic domain configurations and enhanced effective fields. The unique magnetic coupling markedly improves electromagnetic absorption for fifth&#8208;generation frequencies.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of van der Waals forces within 2D atomic layers allows for exact control over electron&#8211;phonon coupling, leading to the exceptional quantum properties. However, applying this technique to diverse structures such as 3D materials is challenging. Therefore, investigating new hierarchical structures and different interlayer forces is crucial for overcoming these limitations and discovering novel physical properties. In this work, a multishelled ferromagnetic material with controllable shell numbers is developed. By strategically regulating the magnetic interactions between these shells, the magnetic properties of each shell are fine&#8208;tuned. This approach reveals distinctive magnetic characteristics including regulated magnetic domain configurations and enhanced effective fields. The nanoscale magnetic interactions between the shells are observed and analyzed, which shed light on the modified magnetic properties of each shell, enhancing the understanding and control of ferromagnetic materials. The distinctive magnetic interaction significantly boosts electromagnetic absorption at low&#8208;frequency frequencies used by fifth&#8208;generation wireless devices, outperforming ferromagnetic materials without multilayer structures by several folds. The application of magnetic interactions in materials science reveals thrilling prospects for technological and electronic innovation.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Temperature Operated Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Stabilized by Thermal Barrier for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

The in situ engineered thermal barrier BaZrO3 layer and Zr ions doping for NCM811 cathode in this work, not only reveal a facile and practicable strategy for accelerating the large&#8208;scale commercial application through enhancing the structure and electrochemical stabilities under high operation temperature, but also provide guidance for the modification of various energy conversion and storage materials.








Abstract
The pursuit of high energy density batteries has expedited the fast development of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation induced by local thermal accumulation and anisotropic lattice strain is posing great obstacles for its wide applications. Herein, a highly&#8208;antioxidative BaZrO3 thermal barrier engineered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode through an in situ construction strategy is first reported to circumvent the above issues. It is found that the Zr ions are incorporated to Ni&#8208;rich material lattice and influence on the topotactic lithiation as well as enhance the oxygen electronegativity through the rigid Zr&#9472;O bonds, which effectively alleviates the lattice strain propagation and decreases the excessive oxidization of lattice oxygen for charge compensation. More importantly, the BaZrO3 thermal barrier with an ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity validly impedes the fast heat exchange between electrode and electrolyte to mitigate the severe surface side reactions. This helps an ultra&#8208;high mass loading Li&#8208;ion pouch cell deliver a specific energy density of 690&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at active material level and an excellent capacity retention of 92.5% after 1400 cycles under 1 C at 25&#160;&#176;C. Tested at a high temperature of 55&#160;&#176;C, the pouch type full&#8208;cell also exhibits 88.7% in capacity retention after 1200 cycles.

         <title>Unveiling the Synergistic Role of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Ni/NiOx Photothermal Cocatalyst for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density oxygen (VO) and nickel (VNi) vacancies are formed at the interface of Ni/NiOx encapsulated in graphitized carbon (Ni/NiOx@C) due to the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during polycrystalline annealing. These vacancies establish highly active frustrated Lewis pairs, which significantly enhance the processes of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the defect&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in Ni/NiOx@C facilitates efficient photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;density and closely spaced frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) is crucial for enhancing catalyst activity and accelerating reaction rates. However, constructing efficient FLPs by breaking classical Lewis bonds poses a significant challenge. Here, this work has made a pivotal discovery regarding the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the formation of grain boundaries in carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni/NiOx (Ni/NiOx@C). This effect facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density O (VO) and Ni (VNi) vacancy sites with different charge polarities, specifically FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C basic sites and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C acidic sites. The synergistic interaction between FLP&#8208;VO&#8208;C and FLP&#8208;VNi&#8208;C sites not only reduces energy barriers for water adsorption and splitting, but also induces a strong photothermal effect. This mutually reinforcing effect contributes to the exceptional performance of Ni/NiOx@C as a cocatalyst in photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic hydrogen production. Notably, the Ni/NiOx@C/g&#8208;C3N4 (NOCC) composite photocatalyst exhibits remarkable hydrogen production activity with a rate of 10.7 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing that of the Pt cocatalyst by 1.76 times. Moreover, the NOCC achieves an impressive apparent quantum yield of 40.78% at a wavelength of 380&#160;nm. This work paves the way for designing novel defect&#8208;state multiphase cocatalysts with high&#8208;density and adjacent FLP sites, which hold promise for enhancing various catalytic reactions.

This study introduces a new type of Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system that employs dual&#8208;functional electrostatic transducers constructed from fabric&#8208;based materials. Assisted by a machine learning algorithm, it is possible to translate the Braille alphabet and 40 commonly used words (extensible) into speech with an accuracy of 99.09% and 97.08%, respectively.








Abstract
A wearable Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system is of great importance for providing auditory feedback in assisting blind people and people with speech impairment. However, previous reported Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation systems still need to be improved in terms of comfortability or integration. Here, a Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system that uses dual&#8208;functional electrostatic transducers which are made of fabric&#8208;based materials and can be integrated into textiles is reported. Based on electrostatic induction, the electrostatic transducer can either serve as a tactile sensor or a loudspeaker with the same design. The proposed electrostatic transducers have excellent output performances, mechanical robustness, and working stability. By combining the devices with machine learning algorithms, it is possible to translate the Braille alphabet and 40 commonly used words (extensible) into speech with an accuracy of 99.09% and 97.08%, respectively. This work demonstrates a new approach for further developments of advanced assistive technology toward improving the lives of disabled people.

         <title>Top&#8208;Down Induced Crystallization Orientation toward Highly Efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down engineering strategy of perovskite crystallization is introduced via propylamine chloride (PACl) post treatment of perovskite wet film, inducing downward preferred crystallization orientation and realizing excellent homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 25.07% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PVSCs, as well as the enhanced thermal and operational stability.









Abstract
Crystallization orientation plays a crucial role in determining the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whereas effective strategies for realizing oriented perovskite crystallization is still lacking. Herein, a facile and efficient top&#8208;down strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization orientation via treating perovskite wet film with propylamine chloride (PACl) before annealing. The PA+ ions tend to be adsorbed on the (001) facet of the perovskite surface, resulting in the reduced cleavage energy to induce (001) orientation&#8208;dominated growth of perovskite film and then reduce the temperature of phase transition, meanwhile, the penetrating Cl ions further regulate the crystallization process. As&#8208;prepared (001)&#8208;dominant perovskite films exhibit the ameliorative film homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale, leading to alleviated lattice mismatch and lowered defect density. The resultant PVSC devices deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.07% with enhanced stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of operation at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Freestanding Serpentine Silicon Strips with Ultrahigh Stretchability over 300% for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy is proposed to achieve freestanding serpentine silicon strips with ultrahigh stretchability over 300%. The strips exhibit excellent stability and durability, and can keep conformal contact with the skin. Combined with the mature processing techniques and excellent semiconductor properties of silicon, freestanding serpentine silicon strips hold promise as core stretchable electronic materials for wearable electronics.








Abstract
Well&#8208;functionalized electronic materials, such as silicon, in a stretchable format are desirable for high&#8208;performance wearable electronics. However, obtaining Si materials that meet the required stretchability of over 100% for wearable applications remains a significant challenge. Herein, a rational design strategy is proposed to achieve freestanding serpentine Si strips (FS&#8208;Si strips) with ultrahigh stretchability, fulfilling wearable requirements. The self&#8208;supporting feature makes the strips get rid of excessive constraints from substrates and enables them to deform with the minimum strain energy. Micrometer&#8208;scale thicknesses enhance robustness, and large diameter&#8208;to&#8208;width ratios effectively reduce strain concentration. Consequently, the FS&#8208;Si strips with the optimum design could withstand 300% stretch, bending, and torsion without fracturing, even under rough manual operation. They also exhibit excellent stability and durability over 50,000 cycles of 100% stretching cycles. For wearable applications, the FS&#8208;Si strips can maintain conformal contact with the skin and have a maximum stretchability of 120%. Moreover, they are electrically insensitive to large deformations, which ensure signal stability during their daily use. Combined with mature processing techniques and the excellent semiconductor properties of Si, FS&#8208;Si strips are promising core stretchable electronic materials for wearable electronics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Photosensitizer Synergy Empowers Ambient Light Photoactivation of Indium Oxide for High&#8208;Performance NO2 Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of interface chemistry of Au&#8208;BixIn2&#8208;xO3 in green&#8208;light&#8208;activated NO2 sensing is systematically investigated. The synergistic interplay between Bi dopants and Au nanoparticles is the key to photosensitizing In2O3 to visible light, significantly reinforcing sensitivity and reversibility at ambient conditions. This meticulous study provides an understanding of the photoactivation mechanism mediated by two dissimilar photosensitizers.








Abstract
Light&#8208;activated chemiresistors offer a powerful approach to achieving lower&#8208;temperature gas sensing with unprecedented sensitivities. However, an incomplete understanding of how photoexcited charge carriers enhance sensitivity obstructs the rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors, impeding the practical utilization under commonly accessible light sources instead of ultraviolet&#160;or higher&#8208;energy sources. Here, a rational approach is presented to modulate the electronic properties of the parent metal oxide phase, exemplified by this model system of Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 nanofibers decorated with Au nanoparticles (NPs) that exhibit superior NO2 sensing performance. Bi doping introduces mid&#8208;gap energy levels into In2O3, promoting photoactivation even under visible blue light. Additionally, green&#8208;absorbing plasmonic Au NPs facilitate electron transfer across the heterojunction, extending the photoactive region toward the green light. It is revealed that the direct involvement of photogenerated charge carriers in gas adsorption and desorption processes is pivotal for enhancing gas sensing performance. Owing to the synergistic interplay between the Bi dopants and the Au NPs, the Au&#8208;BixIn2&#8208;xO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0.04) sensing layers attain impressive response values (Rg/Ra&#160;=&#160;104 at 0.6&#160;ppm NO2) under green light illumination and demonstrate practical viability through evaluation under simulated mixed&#8208;light conditions, all of which significantly outperforms previously reported visible light&#8208;activated NO2 sensors.

         <title>Overcoming the Incompatibility Between Electrical Conductivity and Electromagnetic Transmissivity: A Graphene Glass Fiber Fabric Design Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene glass fiber fabric is innovatively fabricated through the first&#8208;developed decoupling chemical vapor deposition growth strategy to controllably prepare high&#8208;quality, layer&#8208;limited graphene on the non&#8208;catalytic nonmetallic GFF, through which the desired compatibility of electrical conductivity and EM transmissivity can be realized; thus, helping get rid of the electrical conductivity&#8211;electromagnetic transmissivity&#8208;incompatible dilemma suffered by conventional conductive materials effectively.








Abstract
Conventional conductive materials such as metals are crucial functional components of conductive systems in diverse electronic instruments. However, their severe intrinsic impedance mismatch with air dielectric causes strong reflection of incident electromagnetic waves, and the resulting low electromagnetic transmissivity typically interferes with surrounding electromagnetic signal communications in modern multifunction&#8208;integrated instruments.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene glass fiber fabric is innovatively fabricated through the first-developed decoupling chemical vapor deposition growth strategy to controllably prepare high-quality, layer-limited graphene on the non-catalytic nonmetallic GFF, through which the desired compatibility of electrical conductivity and EM transmissivity can be realized; thus, helping get rid of the electrical conductivity&#8211;electromagnetic transmissivity-incompatible dilemma suffered by conventional conductive materials effectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional conductive materials such as metals are crucial functional components of conductive systems in diverse electronic instruments. However, their severe intrinsic impedance mismatch with air dielectric causes strong reflection of incident electromagnetic waves, and the resulting low electromagnetic transmissivity typically interferes with surrounding electromagnetic signal communications in modern multifunction-integrated instruments. Herein, graphene glass fiber fabric (GGFF) that merges intrinsic electrical and electromagnetic properties of graphene with dielectric attributes and highly porous macrostructure of glass fiber fabric (GFF) is innovatively developed. Using a novel decoupling chemical vapor deposition growth strategy, high-quality and layer-limited graphene is prepared on noncatalytic nonmetallic GFF in a controlled manner; this is pivotal to realizing GGFF with the desired compatibility among high conductivity, low electromagnetic reflectivity, and high electromagnetic transmissivity. At the same sheet resistance over a wide range of values (250&#8211;3000 &#937;&#183;sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the GGFF exhibits significantly lower electromagnetic reflectivity (by 0.42&#8211;0.51) and higher transmissivity (by 0.27&#8211;0.62) than those of its metal-based conductive counterpart (CuGFF). The material design strategy reported herein provides a constructive solution to eliminate the incompatibility between electrical conductivity and electromagnetic transmissivity faced by conventional conductive materials, spotlighting the applicability of GGFF in electric heating scenarios in radar, antenna, and stealth systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnet CaMnTeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Role of s0 versus s2 Electronic States in Competing Exchange Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates a framework to design triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals, and electronic states for CaMnTeO6 result in the realization of strong quantum fluctuations. This provides a powerful tool for enhancing coherent quantum dynamics in real materials.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric triangular magnets offer a unique platform for realizing strong quantum fluctuations. However, designing these quantum materials remains an open challenge attributable to a knowledge gap in the tunability of competing exchange interactions at the atomic level. Here, a new noncentrosymmetric triangular S&#160;=&#160;3/2 magnet CaMnTeO6 is created based on careful chemical and physical considerations. The model material displays competing magnetic interactions and features nonlinear optical responses with the capability of generating coherent photons. The incommensurate magnetic ground state of CaMnTeO6 with an unusually large spin rotation angle of 127&#176;(1) indicates that the anisotropic interlayer exchange is strong and competing with the isotropic interlayer Heisenberg interaction. The moment of 1.39(1)&#160;&#181;B, extracted from low&#8208;temperature heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements, is only 46% of the expected value of the static moment 3&#160;&#181;B. This reduction indicates the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in the half&#8208;integer spin S&#160;=&#160;3/2 CaMnTeO6 magnet, which is rare. By comparing the spin&#8208;polarized band structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties of AMnTeO6 (A&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Pb), how quantum&#8208;chemical interpretation can illuminate insights into the fundamentals of magnetic exchange interactions, providing a powerful tool for modulating spin dynamics with atomically precise control is demonstrated.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Synthesized Surfactant&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based NO2 Sensors: Unprecedentedly High Sensitivity and Fast Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO2 chemical sensors using aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes demonstrate unprecedently high sensitivity, ultrafast response/recovery, and low limit of detection. This is owing to the surfactant&#8208;free and high quality of the carbon nanotubes in terms of the tube diameter uniformity, tube length, bundling, and defect density. Solvent&#8208;free one&#8208;step facile lamination and industrial viability of the nanotube film is an added benefit.








Abstract
This study pioneers a chemical sensor based on surfactant&#8208;free aerosol&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Unlike conventional CNTs, the SWCNTs used in this study exhibit one of the highest surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. They show minimal bundling without the need for surfactants and have the lowest number of defects among reported CNTs. Furthermore, the dry&#8208;transferrable and facile one&#8208;step lamination results&#160;in promising industrial viability. When applied to devices, the sensor shows excellent sensitivity (41.6% at 500&#160;ppb), rapid response/recovery time (14.2/120.8&#160;s), a remarkably low limit of detection (below &#8776;0.161&#160;ppb), minimal noise, repeatability for more than 50 cycles without fluctuation, and long&#8208;term stability for longer than 6&#160;months. This is the best performance reported for a pure CNT&#8208;based sensor. In addition, the aerosol SWCNTs demonstrate consistent gas&#8208;sensing performance even after 5000 bending cycles, indicating their suitability for wearable applications. Based on experimental and theoretical analyses, the proposed aerosol CNTs are expected to overcome the limitations associated with conventional CNT&#8208;based sensors, thereby offering a promising avenue for various sensor applications.

         <title>Suppressing Ion Migration by Synergistic Engineering of Anion and Cation toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synergistic effect of dimethylammonium and trifluoroacetate, the perovskite solar cells and modules with DMATFA deliver a promising power conversion efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively. The modified device demonstrates excellent operational stability by maintaining 91% of its initial efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.









Abstract
Ion migration&#8208;induced intrinsic instability and large&#8208;area fabrication pose a tough challenge for the commercial deployment of perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, an interface heterojunction and metal electrode stabilization strategy is developed by suppressing ion migration via managing lead&#8208;based imperfections. After screening a series of cations and nonhalide anions, the ideal organic salt molecule dimethylammonium trifluoroacetate (DMATFA) consisting of dimethylammonium (DMA+) cation and trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) anion is selected to manipulate the surface of perovskite films. DMA+ enables the conversion of active excess and/or unreacted PbI2 into stable new phase DMAPbI3, inhibiting photodecomposition of PbI2 and ion migration. Meanwhile, TFA&#8722; can suppress iodide ion migration through passivating undercoordinated Pb2+ and/or iodide vacancies. DMA+ and TFA&#8722; synergistically stabilize the heterojunction interface and silver electrode. The DMATFA&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells and modules achieve a maximum efficiency of 25.03% (certified 24.65%, 0.1 cm2) and 20.58% (63.74 cm2), respectively, which is the record efficiency ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation technology. The DMATFA modification results in outstanding operational stability, as evidenced by maintaining 91% of its original efficiency after 1520 h of maximum power point continuous tracking.

         <title>Spacer Conformation Induced Multiple Hydrogen Bonds in 2D Perovskite toward Highly Efficient Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;spacer conformation induces multiple hydrogen bonds in new 2D DJ perovskite toward highly efficient optoelectronic devices with exceptional sensitivity to UV and X&#8208;ray photons, while also demonstrating excellent applicability for UV weak&#8208;light imaging.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites typically outperform Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) analogs in terms of photodetection (PD).

&lt;p&gt;Interlayer-spacer conformation induces multiple hydrogen bonds in new 2D DJ perovskite toward highly efficient optoelectronic devices with exceptional sensitivity to UV and X-ray photons, while also demonstrating excellent applicability for UV weak-light imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites typically outperform Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) analogs in terms of photodetection (PD). However, the mechanism behind this enhanced performance remains elusive. Theoretical calculations for elucidating interlayer spacer conformation-induced multiple hydrogen bonds in 2D perovskite are presented, along with the synthesis of DPAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (DPB) single crystals (SCs) and their PD properties under X-ray/ultraviolet (UV) excitation. The high-quality DPB SC enhances PD with exceptional photoresponse attributes, including a high on/off ratio (4.89&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), high responsivity (2.44 A&#160;W&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), along with large dynamic linear range (154 dB) and low detection limit (7.1 nW&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which are currently the best results among 2D perovskite SC detectors, respectively. Importantly, high-resolution images are obtained under UV illumination with weak light levels. The SC X-ray detector exhibits a high sensitivity of 663 &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 V and a detection limit of 1.44 &#181;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Anomalous Detachment Behavior and Directional Reconstruction Regulation of Leaching&#8208;Type Precatalysts for Industrial Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New reconstruction mechanisms and anomalous detachment behaviors of leaching&#8208;type oxygen&#8208;evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions are uncovered, different from the reported results obtained under traditional laboratory conditions. A targeted reconstruction via gradient test strategy is proposed to effectively solve the detachment issue. Dual&#8208;site regulation enables the reconstructed catalyst with high performance in a realistic electrolyzer.








Abstract
Current reconstruction chemistry studies are mainly operated at the laboratory scale, where the operating parameters are different from those used in industrial water electrolyzers. This gap leads to unclear reconstruction behaviors under industrial conditions and constrains the application of catalysts. Here, this work presents a new reconstruction mechanism and anomalous detachment phenomena observed in leaching&#8208;type oxygen&#8208;evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions, different from the reported results obtained under laboratory conditions. The identified detachment issues are closely linked to the production of a potassium salt separate phase, which proves sensitive to the local environment, and its instability easily leads to catalyst stripping from the substrate. By establishing detachment critical point and operating parameter&#8208;detachment correlation, a targeted reconstruction strategy is proposed to achieve smooth ligand leaching and effectively solve the detachment issue. Theoretical analyses validate the dual&#8208;site regulation in directionally reconstructed catalysts with optimized intermediate adsorption. Under industrial conditions, the coupled electrolyzer delivers an industrial&#8208;level current density at low cell voltage with prolonged durability, 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V for over 340 h. This work bridges the gap of leaching&#8208;type precatalysts between laboratory test conditions and industrial operating conditions.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Enabled Pneumatic Multiscale Shape Morphing for Adaptive, Programmable and Multimodal Radar&#8208;infrared Compatible Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and reverse engineering, the MXene&#8208;enabled pneumatic matrix demonstrates unprecedented radar&#8208;infrared compatible camouflage, including dynamic adaptability, multispectral compatibility, multi&#8208;pixel programmability, multi&#8208;modal switching, high responsiveness, performance robustness, and weak angular dependence. The approach establishes an upgradable solution and realistic platform for smart electromagnetic sheath and advanced electromagnetic functional materials.








Abstract
Achieving radar&#8208;infrared compatible camouflage with dynamic adaptability has been a long&#8208;sought goal, but faces significant challenges owing to the limited dispersion relations of conventional material systems operating in different wavelength ranges. Here, this work proposes the concept of pneumatic multiscale shape morphing and design a periodically arranged pneumatic unit consisting of MXene&#8208;based morphable conductors and intake platforms. During gas actuation, the morphable conductor transforms centimeter&#8208;scale 2D flat sheets into 3D balloon shapes to enhance microwave absorption behavior, and also reconfigures micrometer&#8208;scale MXene wrinkles into smooth planes in combination with cavity&#8208;induced low heat transfer to minimize infrared (IR) signatures. Through theory&#8208;guided reverse engineering, the final pneumatic matrix shows remarkable frequency tunability (2.64&#8211;18.0 GHz), moderate IR emissivity regulation (0.14 at 7&#8211;16.5 &#181;m), rapid responsiveness (&#8776;30 ms), wide&#8208;angle operation (&gt;45&#176;), and excellent environmental tolerance. Additionally, the multiplexed pneumatic matrix enables over 14 programmable coding sequences that independently alter thermal radiation without compromising radar stealth, and allows multimodal camouflage switching between three distinct compatible states. The approach may facilitate the evolution of camouflage techniques and electromagnetic functional materials toward multispectral, adaptability and intelligence.

         <title>Programmable, High&#8208;resolution Printing of Spatially Graded Perovskites for Multispectral Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ mixing and printing of micro/nanostructured perovskites with arbitrary spatial gradients with ultrahigh resolution (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is introduced for the first time, and high&#8208;performance multispectral photodetectors (Responsivity:&#160;69.88 A W&#8722;1, Detectivity: 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones) are constructed, opening new avenues for the fabrication of miniaturized perovskite spectrometer and hyperspectral imaging sensors.








Abstract
Micro/nanostructured perovskites with spatially graded compositions and bandgaps are promising in filter&#8208;free, chip&#8208;level multispectral, and hyperspectral detection. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution patterning of perovskites with controlled graded compositions is challenging. Here, a programmable mixed electrohydrodynamic printing (M&#8208;ePrinting) technique is presented to realize the one&#8208;step direct&#8208;printing of arbitrary spatially graded perovskite micro/nanopatterns for the first time. M&#8208;ePrinting enables in situ mixing and ejection of solutions with controlled composition/bandgap by programmatically varying driving voltage applied to a multichannel nozzle. Composition can be graded over a single dot, line or complex pattern, and the printed feature size is down to 1&#160;&#181;m, which is the highest printing resolution of graded patterns to the knowledge. Photodetectors based on micro/nanostructured perovskites with halide ions gradually varying from Br to I are constructed, which successfully achieve multispectral detection and full&#8208;color imaging, with a high detectivity and responsivity of 3.27 &#215; 1015 Jones and 69.88 A W&#8722;1, respectively. The presented method provides a versatile and competitive approach for such miniaturized bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite spectrometer platforms and artificial vision systems, and also opens new avenues for the digital fabrication of composition&#8208;programmable structures.

         <title>Biphase Pd Nanosheets with Atomic&#8208;Hybrid RhOx/Pd Amorphous Skins Disentangle the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphase Pd@PdRh nanosheets within the form of ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd{111} inner cores wrapped by &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins are innovatively designed and synthesized. The surface flexible atomic&#8208;coordination and enriched RhOx/Pd atomic&#8208;interfaces cooperatively endow the products with unprecedented electrocatalysis performance for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
The activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8776;1 nm thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade&#8208;off dilemma for alkaline ORR are developed. The superthin amorphous skins significantly amplify the quantity of flexibly low&#8208;coordinated atoms for electrocatalysis. An in situ selected oxidation of the top&#8208;surface Rh dopants creates atomically hybrid RhOx/Pd disorder surfaces. Detailed energy spectra and theoretical simulation confirm that these RhOx/Pd interfaces can arouse a surface charge redistribution, causing significant electron deficiency and lowered d&#8208;band center for surface Pd. Meanwhile, anticorrosive Rh/RhOx species can thermodynamically passivate the neighboring Pd atoms from oxidative dissolution. Thanks to these amplified interfacial effects, the biphase c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs simultaneously exhibit a superhigh ORR activity (5.92 A mg&#8722;1, 22.8 times that of Pt/C) and an outstanding long&#8208;lasting stability after 100k cycles of accelerated durability test, showcasing unprecedented electrocatalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of ORR. This work paves a bran&#8208;new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts through creating modulated amorphous skins on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Biphase Pd@PdRh nanosheets within the form of ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd{111} inner cores wrapped by &#8776;1 nm thin atomic-hybrid RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Pd amorphous skins are innovatively designed and synthesized. The surface flexible atomic-coordination and enriched RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Pd atomic-interfaces cooperatively endow the products with unprecedented electrocatalysis performance for breaking the activity-stability trade-off in oxygen reduction reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity-stability trade-off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin two-dimensional crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8776;1 nm thin atomic-hybrid RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a-Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade-off dilemma for alkaline ORR are developed. The superthin amorphous skins significantly amplify the quantity of flexibly low-coordinated atoms for electrocatalysis. An in situ selected oxidation of the top-surface Rh dopants creates atomically hybrid RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Pd disorder surfaces. Detailed energy spectra and theoretical simulation confirm that these RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Pd interfaces can arouse a surface charge redistribution, causing significant electron deficiency and lowered &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center for surface Pd. Meanwhile, anticorrosive Rh/RhO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species can thermodynamically passivate the neighboring Pd atoms from oxidative dissolution. Thanks to these amplified interfacial effects, the biphase c/a-Pd@PdRh NSs simultaneously exhibit a superhigh ORR activity (5.92 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 22.8 times that of Pt/C) and an outstanding long-lasting stability after 100k cycles of accelerated durability test, showcasing unprecedented electrocatalysts for breaking the activity-stability trade-off relationship of ORR. This work paves a bran-new strategy for designing high-performance electrocatalysts through creating modulated amorphous skins on low-dimensional nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;Dielectric for Droplet Manipulation on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (OEW), which is distinctive from the cross&#8208;electrode droplet manipulation in conventional electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric. Specially, the OEW enables precise, high&#8208;speed, residue&#8208;free, and durable droplet manipulation without electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control, which are favorable for upgrading electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric&#8208;based chemical and biological technologies.








Abstract
Electrowetting&#8208;on&#8208;dielectric (EWOD), recognized as the most successful electrical droplet actuation method, is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite significant advances, it remains challenging to achieve repeatability, high speed, and simple circuitry in EWOD&#8208;based droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, its efficient operation typically requires electrode arrays and sophisticated circuit control. Here, a newly observed droplet manipulation phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces with orbital EWOD (OEW) is reported. Due to the asymmetric electrowetting force generated on the orbit, flexible and versatile droplet manipulation is facilitated with OEW. It is demonstrated that OEW droplet manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits higher speed (up to 5 times faster), enhanced functionality (antigravity), and manipulation of diverse liquids (acid, base, salt, organic, e.g., methyl blue, artificial blood) without contamination, and good durability after 1000 tests. It is envisioned that this robust droplet manipulation strategy using OEW will provide a valuable platform for various processes involving droplets, spanning from microfluidic devices to controllable chemical reactions. The previously unreported droplet manipulation phenomenon and control strategy shown here can potentially upgrade EWOD&#8208;based microfluidics, antifogging, anti&#8208;icing, dust removal, and beyond.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Polyelectrolyte Complex Assembly of microRNA&#8208;Peptide Nanoparticles toward Treating Mesothelioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide design married with flash nanocomplexation affords highly stable and uniform polyelectrolyte complex microRNA&#8208;peptide nanoparticles (NPs). NP incorporation into a self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based surface&#8208;fill hydrogel allows local delivery to tumor and subsequent inhibition of genes responsible for the progression of mesothelioma cancer in mice.








Abstract
Broad size distributions and poor long&#8208;term colloidal stability of microRNA&#8208;carrying nanoparticles, especially those formed by polyelectrolyte complexation, represent major hurdles in realizing their clinical translation. Herein, peptide design is used alongside optimized flash nanocomplexation (FNC) to produce uniform peptide&#8208;based miRNA particles of exceptional stability that display anticancer activity against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo. Modulating the content and display of lysine&#8208;based charge from small intrinsically disordered peptides used to complex miRNA proves essential in achieving stable colloids. FNC facilitates kinetic isolation of the mechanistic steps involved in particle formation to allow the preparation of particles of discrete size in a highly reproducible, scalable, and continuous manner, facilitating pre&#8208;clinical studies. To the best of the authors knowledge, this work represents the first example of employing FNC to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes of miRNA and peptide. Encapsulation of these particles into an injectable hydrogel matrix allows for their localized in vivo delivery by syringe. A one&#8208;time injection of a gel containing particles composed of miRNA&#8208;215&#8208;5p and the peptide PKM1 limits tumor progression in a xenograft model of mesothelioma.

         <title>Supergravity&#8208;Steered Generic Manufacturing of Nanosheets&#8208;Embedded Nanocomposite Hydrogel with Highly Oriented, Heterogeneous Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supergravity&#8208;steered approach is designed to manipulate the assembly of arbitrary nanosheets from MXene to MoS2, GO, and C3N4 for fabricating oriented nanocomposite hydrogels with heterogeneous architecture. The resultant MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels showcase an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 55.2&#160;dB yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials.








Abstract
Designing nanocomposite hydrogels with oriented nanosheets has emerged as a promising toolkit to achieve preferential performances that go beyond their disordered counterparts. Although current fabrication strategies via electric/magnetic force fields have made remarkable achievements, they necessitate special properties of nanosheets and suffer from an inferior orientation degree of nanosheets. Herein, a facile and universal approach is discovered to elaborate MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels with highly oriented, heterogeneous architecture by virtue of supergravity to replace conventional force fields. The key to such architecture is to leverage bidirectional, force&#8208;tunable attributes of supergravity containing coupled orthogonal shear and centrifugal force field for steering high&#8208;efficient movement, pre&#8208;orientation, and stacking of MXene nanosheets in the bottom. Such a synergetic effect allows for yielding heterogeneous nanocomposite hydrogels with a high&#8208;orientation MXene&#8208;rich layer (orientation degree, f = 0.83) and a polymer&#8208;rich layer. The authors demonstrate that MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogels leverage their high&#8208;orientation, heterogeneous architecture to deliver an extraordinary electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 55.2&#160;dB at 12.4&#160;GHz yet using a super&#8208;low MXene of 0.3 wt%, surpassing most hydrogels&#8208;based electromagnetic shielding materials. This versatile supergravity&#8208;steered strategy can be further extended to arbitrary nanosheets including MoS2, GO, and C3N4, offering a paradigm in the development of oriented nanocomposites.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Coordinated Tin Halide Perovskites for Wearable Health Monitoring and Weak Light Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation via strong coordination interaction. Self&#8208;powered photodetectors based on the CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite film with CNI exhibit low dark current, high detectivity, fast response speed, and good stability. Consequently, wearable health monitoring and weak light imaging with zero power consumption are successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Low&#8208;toxicity tin halide perovskites with excellent optoelectronic properties are promising candidates for photodetection. However, tin halide perovskite photodetectors have suffered from high dark current owing to uncontrollable Sn2+ oxidation. Here, 2&#8208;cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced in CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation by the strong coordination interaction between the cyano group (C&#8801;N) and Sn2+. Consequently, FASnI3&#8208;CNI films exhibit reduced nonradiative recombination and lower trap density. The self&#8208;powered photodetector based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI exhibits low dark current (1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high detectivity (2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 785&#160;nm), fast response speed (2.62 &#181;s), and good stability. Mechanism studies show the increase in the activation energy required for thermal emission and generated&#160;carriers, leading to a lower dark current in the FASnI3&#8208;CNI photodetector. In addition, flexible photodetectors based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI, exhibiting high detectivity and fast response speed, are employed in wearable electronics to monitor the human heart rate under weak light and zero bias conditions. Finally, the FASnI3&#8208;CNI perovskite photodetectors are integrated with a 32&#160;&#215;&#160;32 thin&#8208;film transistor backplane, capable of ultraweak light (170 nW cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging with high contrast, and zero power consumption, demonstrating the great potential for image sensor applications.

Self-powered photodetectors based on the CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;3 (&lt;/sub&gt;FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3)&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film with CNI exhibit low dark current, high detectivity, fast response speed, and good stability. Consequently, wearable health monitoring and weak light imaging with zero power consumption are successfully demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-toxicity tin halide perovskites with excellent optoelectronic properties are promising candidates for photodetection. However, tin halide perovskite photodetectors have suffered from high dark current owing to uncontrollable Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation. Here, 2-cyanoethan-1-aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced in CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite films to inhibit Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation by the strong coordination interaction between the cyano group (C&#8801;N) and Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CNI films exhibit reduced nonradiative recombination and lower trap density. The self-powered photodetector based on FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CNI exhibits low dark current (1.04 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt; A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), high detectivity (2.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 785&#160;nm), fast response speed (2.62 &#181;s), and good stability. Mechanism studies show the increase in the activation energy required for thermal emission and generated&#160;carriers, leading to a lower dark current in the FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CNI photodetector. In addition, flexible photodetectors based on FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CNI, exhibiting high detectivity and fast response speed, are employed in wearable electronics to monitor the human heart rate under weak light and zero bias conditions. Finally, the FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CNI perovskite photodetectors are integrated with a 32&#160;&#215;&#160;32 thin-film transistor backplane, capable of ultraweak light (170 nW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) real-time imaging with high contrast, and zero power consumption, demonstrating the great potential for image sensor applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, juice vesicles bioreactors (JVBs) biotechnology is reported to produce hierarchically structured carbon composites on a large scale. The synthetic mechanism of carbon composites via JVBs is explained. The well&#8208;designed 3D carbonaceous architecture combined with NiCo nanoparticles endows pomelo vesicles crosslinked carbon/NiCo&#8208;S electrode with superior high&#8208;rate performance and good cycling stability.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;quality carbon&#8208;based energy materials through biotechnology has always been an eager goal of the scientific community. Herein, juice vesicles bioreactors (JVBs) bio&#8208;technology based on hesperidium (e.g., pomelo, waxberry, oranges) is first reported for preparation of carbon&#8208;based composites with controllable components, adjustable morphologies, and sizes. JVBs serve as miniature reaction vessels that enable sophisticated confined chemical reactions to take place, ultimately resulting in the formations of complex carbon composites. The newly developed approach is highly versatile and can be compatible with a wide range of materials including metals, alloys, and metal compounds. The growth and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of carbon composites via JVBs are explained. For illustration, NiCo alloy nanoparticles are successfully in situ implanted into pomelo vesicles crosslinked carbon (PCC) by JVBs, and their applications as sulfur/carbon cathodes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are explored. The well&#8208;designed PCC/NiCo&#8208;S electrode exhibits superior high&#8208;rate properties and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Synergistic reinforcement mechanisms on transportation of ions/electrons of interface reactions and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides arising from metal alloy and carbon architecture are proposed with the aid of DFT calculations. The research provides a novel biosynthetic route to rational design and fabrication of carbon composites for advanced energy storage.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Deep Eutectic Liquids Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Polarization Aluminum Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE) is constructed by diluting [AlCl3]1.3[Urea]1 with 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn). dFBn leads to better fluidity and ionic transport, without affecting the ionic dynamics. Al&#8208;graphite and Al&#8208;S batteries employing LC&#8208;DELEs exhibit weakened polarization and enhanced cyclic stability. This work demonstrates that LC&#8208;DELEs is a feasible strategy enabling low&#8208;polarization aluminum metal batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and nontoxic deep eutectic liquid electrolytes (DELEs), such as [AlCl3]1.3[Urea] (AU), are promising for rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AMBs). However, their high viscosity and sluggish ion transport at room temperature lead to high cell polarization and low specific capacity, limiting their practical application. Herein, non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent of DELEs using AU as model to construct a locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE). dFBn effectively improves the fluidity and ion transport without affecting the ionic dynamics in the electrolyte. Moreover, dFBn also modifies the solid electrolyte interphase growing on the aluminum metal anodes and reduces the interfacial resistance. As a result, the lifespan of Al/Al cells is improved from 210 to 2000&#160;h, and the cell polarization is reduced from 0.36 to 0.14&#160;V at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The rate performance of Al&#8208;graphite cells is greatly improved with a polarization reduction of 0.15 and 0.74&#160;V at 0.1 and 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. The initial discharge capacity of Al&#8208;sulfur cells is improved from 94 to 1640&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides a feasible solution to the high polarization of AMBs employing DELEs and a new path to high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost AMBs.

         <title>Ultrastable N&#8208;Type Semiconducting Fiber Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meticulously designed wet&#8208;spinning method successfully produces n&#8208;type semiconducting fibers with reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement. Organic electrochemical transistors based on these fibers exhibit superior performance and unprecedented stability, advancing the development of highly sensitive biosensors and fiber&#8208;based complementary logic circuits, and paving the way for fiber&#8208;based bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted increasing attention due to their merits of high transconductance, low operating voltage, and good biocompatibility, ideal for biosensors. However, further advances in their practical applications face challenges of low n&#8208;type performance and poor stability. Here, it is demonstrated that wet&#8208;spinning the commercially available n&#8208;type conjugated polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) into highly aligned and crystalline fibers enhances both OECT performance and stability. Although BBL is only soluble in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point strong acids, it can be wet&#8208;spun into high&#8208;quality fibers with adjustable diameters. The BBL fiber OECTs exhibit a record&#8208;high area&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,A) of 2.40 &#181;S &#181;m&#8722;2 and over 10 times higher figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) than its thin&#8208;film counterparts. More importantly, these fiber OECTs exhibit remarkable stability with no noticeable performance attenuation after 1500 cycles over 4&#160;h operation, outperforming all previously reported n&#8208;type OECTs. The superior performance and stability can be attributed to shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement in the fibers, endowing the BBL fiber OECT&#8208;based biosensors with outstanding sensitivity while keeping a miniaturized form factor. This work demonstrates that, beyond new material development, developing new fabrication technology is also crucial for addressing the performance and stability issues in n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>Phase Engineered CuxS&#8211;Ag2S with Photothermoelectric Activity for Enhanced Multienzyme Activity and Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous&#8208;crystalline hybrid material CuxS&#8211;Ag2S is explored for optimizing synergistic therapy. The characteristics of both amorphous and crystalline phases play a key role in thermoelectrodynamically enhancing enzyme catalytic activity. Thus, the catalytic active site is increased, site competition is avoided, and the temperature gradient is reasonably constructed.








Abstract
The insufficient exposure sites and active site competition of multienzyme are the two main factors to hinder its therapeutic effect. Here, a phase&#8208;junction nanomaterial (amorphous&#8208;crystalline CuxS&#8211;Ag2S) is designed and prepared through a simple room temperature ion&#8208;exchange process. A small amount of Ag+ is added into Cu7S4 nanocrystals, which transforms Cu7S4 into amorphous phased CuxS and produces crystalline Ag2S simultaneously. In this structure, the overhanging bonds on the amorphous CuxS surface provide abundant active sites for optimizing the therapeutic activity. Meanwhile, the amorphous state enhances the photothermal effect through non&#8208;radiative relaxation, and due to its low thermal resistance, phase&#8208;junction CuxS&#8211;Ag2S forms a significant temperature gradient to unlock the optimized thermo&#8208;electrodynamic therapy. Furthermore, benefiting from the high asymmetry of the amorphous state, the material forms a spin&#8208;polarized state that can effectively inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination. In this way, the thermoelectric effect can facilitate the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle by providing electrons and holes, enabling an enhanced coupling of thermoelectric therapy with multienzyme activity, which induces excellent anti&#8208;tumor performance. More importantly, the catalytic process simulated by density&#8208;functional theory proves that Ag+ alleviates the burden on the Cu sites through favorable adsorption of O2 and prevents active site competition.

&lt;p&gt;An amorphous-crystalline hybrid material Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8211;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is explored for optimizing synergistic therapy. The characteristics of both amorphous and crystalline phases play a key role in thermoelectrodynamically enhancing enzyme catalytic activity. Thus, the catalytic active site is increased, site competition is avoided, and the temperature gradient is reasonably constructed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insufficient exposure sites and active site competition of multienzyme are the two main factors to hinder its therapeutic effect. Here, a phase-junction nanomaterial (amorphous-crystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8211;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is designed and prepared through a simple room temperature ion-exchange process. A small amount of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is added into Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals, which transforms Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into amorphous phased Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S and produces crystalline Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S simultaneously. In this structure, the overhanging bonds on the amorphous Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S surface provide abundant active sites for optimizing the therapeutic activity. Meanwhile, the amorphous state enhances the photothermal effect through non-radiative relaxation, and due to its low thermal resistance, phase-junction Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8211;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S forms a significant temperature gradient to unlock the optimized thermo-electrodynamic therapy. Furthermore, benefiting from the high asymmetry of the amorphous state, the material forms a spin-polarized state that can effectively inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination. In this way, the thermoelectric effect can facilitate the enzyme-catalyzed cycle by providing electrons and holes, enabling an enhanced coupling of thermoelectric therapy with multienzyme activity, which induces excellent anti-tumor performance. More importantly, the catalytic process simulated by density-functional theory proves that Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; alleviates the burden on the Cu sites through favorable adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and prevents active site competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Light Outcoupling Efficiency via Anisotropic Low Refractive Index Electron Transporting Materials for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

An anisotropic anthracene derivative, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene, featuring a low extraordinary refractive index and high electron mobility, is developed as an efficient electron transporting material for perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) to enhance light outcoupling efficiency and carrier balance of the devices, which promotes green PeLEDs with a record EQE of 32.1%.








Abstract
Thanks to the extensive efforts toward optimizing perovskite crystallization properties, high&#8208;quality perovskite films with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield are successfully achieved. However, the light outcoupling efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by insufficient light extraction, which poses a challenge to the further advancement of PeLEDs. Here, an anisotropic multifunctional electron transporting material, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene (BPBiPA), with a low extraordinary refractive index (ne) and high electron mobility is developed for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs. The anisotropic molecular orientations of BPBiPA can result in a low ne of 1.59 along the z&#8208;axis direction. Optical simulations show that the low ne of BPBiPA can effectively mitigate the surface plasmon polariton loss and enhance the photon extraction efficiency in waveguide mode, thereby improving the light outcoupling efficiency of PeLEDs. In addition, the high electron mobility of BPBiPA can facilitate balanced carrier injection in PeLEDs. As a result, high&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 32.1% and a current efficiency of 111.7&#160;cd A&#8722;1 are obtained, which provides new inspirations for the design of electron transporting materials for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Modular Protein Fibers with Outstanding High&#8208;Strength and Acid&#8208;Resistance Performance Mediated by Copper Ion Binding and Imine Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust protein fibers are constructed from chimeric proteins consisting of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible elastin&#8208;like protein modules. The Cu2+ binding and imine crosslinking are introduced to construct the double networks, which endow the fibers with exceptional mechanical performance and acid resistance. Gastric perforation suturing is successfully investigated, greatly expanding their multi&#8208;scenario applications in complex environments.








Abstract
Engineered protein fibers are promising biomaterials with diverse applications due to their tunable protein structure and outstanding mechanical properties. However, it remains challenging at the molecular level to achieve satisfied mechanical properties and environmental tolerance simultaneously, especially under extreme acid conditions. Herein, the construction of artificial fibers comprising chimeric proteins made of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible cationic elastin&#8208;like protein (ELP) module is reported. The amyloid peptide readily assembles into highly organized &#946;&#8208;sheet structures that can be further strengthened by the coordination of Cu2+, while the flexible ELP module allows the formation of imine&#8208;based crosslinking networks. These double networks synergistically enhance the mechanical properties of the fibers, leading to a high tensile strength and toughness, overwhelming many reported recombinant spidroin fibers. Notably, the coordination of Cu2+ with serine residues could stabilize &#946;&#8208;sheet structures in the fibers under acidic conditions, which makes the fibers robust against acid, thus enabling their successful utilization in gastric perforation suturing. This work highlights the customization of double networks at the molecular level to create tailored high&#8208;performance protein fibers for various application scenarios.

The high charge density and strong electrostatic interactions of Al3+ present a significant challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a bipolar polymer with a long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton, high electronic/ionic conductivity, and a three&#8208;electron reaction mechanism is designed that enables high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance, even within a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;45 &#176;C).








Abstract
Achieving reversible insertion/extraction in most cathodes for aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) is a significant challenge due to the high charge density of Al3+ and strong electrostatic interactions. Organic materials facilitate the hosting of multivalent carriers and rapid ions diffusion through the rearrangement of chemical bonds. Here, a bipolar conjugated poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (PDAP) on carbon substrates prepared via a straightforward electropolymerization method is introduced as cathode for AAIBs. The integration of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active units endow PDAP with an increased number of sites for ions interaction. The long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton enhances electron delocalization and collaborates with carbon to ensure high conductivity. Moreover, the strong intermolecular interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding significantly enhance its stability. Consequently, the Al//PDAP battery exhibits a large capacity of 338 mAh g&#8722;1 with long lifespan and high&#8208;rate capability. It consistently demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performances even under extreme conditions with capacities of 155 and 348 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20 and 45&#160;&#176;C, respectively. In/ex situ spectroscopy comprehensively elucidates its cation/anion (Al3+/H3O+ and ClO4&#8722;) storage with 3&#8208;electron transfer in dual electroactive centers (C&#9552;N and &#8211;NH&#8211;). This study presents a promising strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic cathode for AAIBs over a wide temperature range.

Ru atomic clusters with controlled coordination number loaded on Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution. This atomically controllable cocatalyst strategy is significant for boosting photocatalysis.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have been exploited in various applications. Among them, cocatalyst supported on photocatalyst is essential for activation of photocatalysis. However, cocatalyst decoration in a controllable fashion to promote intrinsic activity remains challenging. Herein, a versatile method is developed for cocatalyst synthesis using an ice&#8208;templating (ICT) strategy, resulting in size control from single&#8208;atom (SA), and atomic clusters (AC) to nanoparticles (NP). Importantly, the coordination numbers (CN) of decorated AC cocatalysts are highly controllable, and this ICT method applies to various metals and photocatalytic substrates. Taking narrow&#8208;band gap Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 (LTCA) photocatalyst as an example, supported Ru AC/LTCA catalysts with regulable Ru CNs have been prepared, delivering significantly enhanced activities compared to Ru SA and Ru NPs supported on LTCA. Specifically, Ru(CN = 3.4) AC/LTCA with an average CN of Ru&#9472;Ru bond measured to be &#8776;3.4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (578&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the modeled Ru(CN = 3) atomic cluster cocatalyst possesses favorable electronic properties and available active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.

         <title>Weak Electrostatic Force on K+ in Gel Polymer Electrolyte Realizes High Ion Transference Number for Quasi Solid&#8208;State Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups is revealed. Thus, a unique K&#8208;ion conducting in situ multilayered gel polymer electrolyte (K&#8208;ISMGPE), which can enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics and inhibit the dendrite growth, is designed. These properties endow it with high ionic conductivity and ion transference number at room temperature. Potassium&#8208;ion batteries using K&#8208;ISMGPE possess superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SSPIBs) are of great potential for commercial use due to the abundant reserves and cost&#8208;effectiveness of resources, as well as high safety. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport are necessary for SSPIBs. Here, the weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups in the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer chains, which can promote fast migration of free K+, is revealed. To further enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics, a multilayered GPE by in situ growth of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) on ETPTA (PVDF&#8208;HFP|ETPTA|PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed to improve the interface contact and provide sufficient K+ concentration in PVDF&#8208;HFP. A high ion transference number (0.92) and a superior ionic conductivity (5.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) are achieved. Consequently, the SSPIBs with both intercalation&#8208;type (PB) and conversion&#8208;type (PTCDA) cathodes show the best battery performance among all reported SSPIBs of the same cathode. These findings demonstrate that potassium&#8208;ion batteries have the potential to surpass Li/Na ion batteries in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Tuning Surface Potential Polarization to Enhance N2 Affinity for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction is a sustainable method for ammonia synthesis, but the adsorption and activation process of N2 limits its reaction efficiency. This work demonstrates that tuning the surface potential polarization of Bi2WO6 can greatly enhance the adsorption and activation ability of N2 molecules, and improve the conversion efficiency under acidic reaction conditions.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia is a sustainable reaction that is expected to replace Haber Bosch process. Laminated Bi2WO6 has great potential as an NRR electrocatalyst, however, the effective activity requires that the inert substrate is fully activated. Here, for the first time, success is achieved in activating the Bi2WO6 basal planes with NRR activity through Ti doping. The introduction of Ti successfully tunes the surface potential distribution and enhances the N2 adsorption. The subsequently strong hybrid coupling of d(Ti)&#8208;p(N) orbitals fills the electronic state of N2 antibonding molecular orbital, which greatly weakens the bonding strength of N&#8801;N bonds. Further, in situ synchrotron radiation&#8208;based Fourier transform infrared&#160;(SR&#8208;FTIR) spectrum and theoretical calculations show that surface potential polarization enhances the adsorption of HNN* by Bi&#8208;Ti dual&#8208;metal sites, which is beneficial for the subsequent activation hydrogenation process. The Ti&#8208;Bi2WO6 nanosheets achieve 11.44% Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.2&#160;V vs. RHE), a NH3 yield rate of 23.14&#160;&#181;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (15N calibration), and satisfactory stability in 0.1&#160;M HCl environment. The mutual assistance of theory and experiment can help understand and develop of excellent two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for the NRR.

         <title>Synergizing Pyroelectric Catalysis and Enzyme Catalysis: Establishing a Reciprocal and Synergistic Model to Enhance Anti&#8208;Tumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>

ZnSnO3@MXene composites can effectively improve the enzymatic activity of MXene by fully utilizing the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3. Meanwhile, MXene provides an inducement for the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3 ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs). Combined with highly cell membrane permeability enhanced by polarized charge, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Nanozyme activity is greatly weakened by the microenvironment and multidrug resistance of tumor cells. Hence, a bi&#8208;catalytic nanoplatform, which promotes the anti&#8208;tumor activity through &#8220;charging empowerment&#8221; and &#8220;mutual complementation&#8221; processes involved in enzymatic and pyroelectric catalysis, by loading ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs) of pyroelectric ZnSnO3 onto MXene nanozyme (V2CTx nanosheets), is developed. Here, the V2CTx nanosheets exhibit enhanced peroxidase activity by reacting V3+ with H2O2 to generate toxic &#183;OH, accelerated by the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated heat effect. The resulting V4+ is then converted to V3+ by oxidizing endogenous glutathione (GSH), realizing an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle. However, the cycle will lose its persistence once GSH is insufficient; nevertheless, the pyroelectric charges generated by ZnSnO3 USNPs continuously support the V4+/V3+ conversion and ensure nanoenzyme durability. Moreover, the hyperthermia arising from the V2CTx nanosheets by NIR irradiation results in an ideal local temperature gradient for the ZnSnO3 USNPs, giving rise to an excellent pyroelectric catalytic effect by promoting band bending. Furthermore, polarized charges increase the tumor cell membrane permeability and facilitate nanodrug accumulation, thereby resolving the multidrug resistance issue. Thus, the combination of pyroelectric and enzyme catalysis together with the photothermal effect solves the dilemma of nanozymes and improves the antitumor efficiency.

         <title>Space&#8208;Efficient 3D Microalgae Farming with Optimized Resource Utilization for Regenerative Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of 3D bioprinting and vertical agriculture offers promising opportunities for cultivating microalgae as regenerative food resource. Biogenic systems that incorporate microalgae in rational design of hydrogels significantly boost microalgae yield for each unit of water consumed. This strategy addresses critical challenges including self&#8208;shading effects and inefficient space utilization, paving the way for more accessible and sustainable food production.








Abstract
Photosynthetic microalgae produce valuable metabolites and are a source of sustainable food that supports life without compromising arable land. However, the light self&#8208;shading, excessive water supply, and insufficient space utilization in microalgae farming have limited its potential in the inland areas most in need of regenerative food solutions. Herein, this work develops a 3D polysaccharide&#8208;based hydrogel scaffold for vertically farming microalgae without needing liquid media. This liquid&#8208;free strategy is compatible with diverse microalgal species and enables the design of living microalgal frameworks with customizable architectures that enhance light and water utilization. This approach significantly increases microalgae yield per unit water consumption, with an 8.8&#8208;fold increase compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the dehydrated hydrogels demonstrate a reduced size and weight (&#8776;70% reduction), but readily recover their vitality upon rehydration. Importantly, valuable natural products can be produced in this system including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and carotenoids. This study streamlines microalgae regenerative farming for low&#8208;carbon biomanufacturing by minimizing light self&#8208;shading, relieving water supply, and reducing physical footprints, and democratizing access to efficient aquatic food production.

         <title>Achieving Bright and Long&#8208;Lived Aqueous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Carbon Nitrogen Dots Through In Situ Host&#8211;Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study successfully develops an efficient in situ host&#8211;guest approach for synthesizing water&#8208;boosted phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots through a one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of cyanuric acid. This material exhibits bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, even in fully aqueous environments, thereby demonstrating significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo, as well as advanced information encryption applications.








Abstract
The development of bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials holds paramount importance in broadening the application scope of RTP material system. However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, an in situ host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed to achieve cyanuric acid (CA)&#8208;derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots (CNDs) composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilize triplet excitons and suppress nonradiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9&#8208;fold increase) and 951.25&#160;ms (5.5&#8208;fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions. Even in fully aqueous environments (with up to 400 wt% water added), CNDs@CA exhibits persistent water&#8208;boosted RTP properties, demonstrating exceptional stability. The robust water&#8208;boosted RTP property of CNDs@CA in aqueous solutions presents significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging as well as advanced information encryption.

         <title>570 Wh&#160;kg&#8315;1&#8208;Grade Lithium Metal Pouch Cell with 4.9V Highly Li+ Conductive Armor&#8208;Like Cathode Electrolyte Interphase via Partially Fluorinated Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly Li+ conductive armor&#8208;like CEI formed in partially fluorinated electrolyte with 0.5&#160;wt% TMSB additive is designed for 570 Wh&#160;kg&#8315;1&#8208;grade Li||LRMO pouch cells. Such armor&#8208;like CEI composed of LiBxOy and LixPOyFz outer layer and LiF and Li3PO4 inner part can reduce lattice oxygen loss, improve mechanical strength, and promote the conductivity of Li+ for enhanced performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) are promisingly used in high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells due to high specific capacity/working voltage. However, the interfacial stability of LRMOs remains challenging. To address this question, a novel armor&#8208;like cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) model is proposed for stabilizing LRMO&#160;cathode at 4.9&#160;V by exploring partially fluorinated electrolyte formulation. The fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and tris (trimethylsilyl) borate (TMSB) in formulated electrolyte largely contribute to the formation of 4.9&#160;V armor&#8208;like CEI with LiBxOy and LixPOyFz outer layer and LiF&#8208; and Li3PO4&#8208;rich inner part. Such CEI effectively inhibits lattice oxygen loss and facilitates the Li+ migration smoothly for guaranteeing LRMO cathode to deliver superior cycling and rate performance. As expected, Li||LRMO batteries with such electrolyte achieve capacity retention of 85.7% with high average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 99.64% after 300 cycles at 4.8&#160;V/0.5 C, and even obtain capacity retention of 87.4% after 100 cycles at higher cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.9&#160;V. Meanwhile, the 9 Ah&#8208;class Li||LRMO pouch cells with formulated electrolyte show over thirty&#8208;eight stable cycling life with high energy density of 576&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Synthetic Sulfonamide&#8208;Based Solvent and Electrochemically Active Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are strategically designed by optimizing the electrolyte solvents and constructing stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine effectively mitigates the drawbacks of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane and facilitates the construction of a well&#8208;designed multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.








Abstract
Considering practical viability, Li&#8208;metal battery electrolytes should be formulated by tuning solvent composition similar to electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;ion batteries to enable the facile salt&#8208;dissociation, ion&#8208;conduction, and introduction of sacrificial additives for building stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Although 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane with a high&#8208;donor number enables the implementation of ionic compounds as effective interface modifiers, its ubiquitous usage is limited by its low&#8208;oxidation durability and high&#8208;volatility. Regulation of the solvation structure and construction of well&#8208;structured interfacial layers ensure the potential strength of electrolytes in both Li&#8208;metal and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). This study reports the build&#8208;up of multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by utilizing different electron&#8208;accepting tendencies of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBP), lithium nitrate, and synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine. Furthermore, a well&#8208;structured cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface from LiDFBP effectively addresses the issues with NCM811. The developed electrolyte based on a framework of highly&#8208; and weakly&#8208;solvating solvents with interface modifiers enables the operation of Li|NCM811 cells with a high areal capacity cathode (4.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 4.4&#160;V versus Li/Li+.

         <title>Building Stable Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) for SPMBs activates the potassium channels in the PEO chain; the functional ions in situ construct a stable interlayer. The ISPE exhibits high ionic conductivity, high K+ ion transference number, and high electrochemical stability voltage, exhibiting stable electrochemical performance. A novel strategy for electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance stable SPMB pouch cells is presented.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (SPMBs) are promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems for their low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, full SPMBs are not yet reported due to the K dendrites, interfacial incompatibility, and limited availability of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Here, stable SPMBs using a new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE) are presented. The functional ions reconstruct ion transport channels, providing efficient potassium ion transport. ISPE shows a combination of high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial compatibility, and electrochemical stability. In situ alloying and iodinated interlayer increase K metal compatibility for prolonged cycling with low polarization. Moreover, the ISPE enables SPMBs with Prussian blue cathode stable operation at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V, a superior rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling over 3000 cycles (4.2&#160;V vs K+/K) with an ultra&#8208;high coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. More importantly, a classic solid&#8208;state potassium metal pouch cell achieves 4.2&#160;V stable cycling over 800 cycles with a high retention of 93.6%, presenting a new development strategy for secure and high&#8208;performance rechargeable solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries.

         <title>Flexible Indoor Perovskite Solar Cells by In Situ Bottom&#8208;Up Crystallization Modulation and Interfacial Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular bridge is introduced at the flexible SnO2/perovskite interface to simultaneously achieve in situ bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation and interfacial passivation utilizing organic bifunctional passivator sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC). The flexible indoor perovskite solar cells deliver an exceptional 41.33% at 1000 lux with a high fill factor of 84.32%.








Abstract
A robust perovskite&#8208;buried interface is pivotal for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaics as it significantly influences charge transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, a molecular bridge strategy is introduced utilizing sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC) additive at the perovskite&#8208;buried interface to simultaneously achieve in situ passivation of interfacial defects and bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, resulting in high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaic applications. Supported by both theoretical calculations and experimental evidences, it illustrates how SZCs serve as molecular bridges, establishing robust bonds between SnO2 transport layer and perovskite, mitigating oxygen vacancy defects and under&#8208;coordinated Pb defects at interface during flexible fabrication. This, in turn, enhances interfacial energy level alignment and facilitates efficient carrier transport. Moreover, this in situ investigation of perovskite crystallization dynamics reveals bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, extending perovskite growth at the buried interface and influencing subsequent surface recrystallization. This results in larger crystalline grains and improved lattice strain of the perovskite during flexible fabrication. Finally, the optimized flexible solar cells achieve an impressive efficiency exceeding 41% at 1000 lux, with a fill factor as high as 84.32%. The concept of the molecular bridge represents a significant advancement in enhancing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based flexible indoor photovoltaics for the upcoming era of Internet of Things (IoT).

         <title>Programmed Targeting Pyruvate Metabolism Therapy Amplified Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme&#8208;Activated Pyroptosis for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric N, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx) is developed to enhance cellular immunogenicity and reshape the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) for effective antitumor immunotherapy. Not only does it trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells but also remodels the immunosuppressive TME by a programmed targeting of pyruvate metabolism.








Abstract
Increasing cellular immunogenicity and reshaping the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial for antitumor immunotherapy. Herein, this work develops a novel single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator: UK5099 and pyruvate oxidase (POx)&#8208;co&#8208;loaded Cu&#8208;NS single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx), that not only trigger pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells, but also remodel the immunosuppressive TME by targeting pyruvate metabolism. By replacing N with weakly electronegative S, the original spatial symmetry of the Cu&#8208;N4 electron distribution is changed and the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process is effectively regulated. Compared to spatially symmetric Cu&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;N4 SA), the S&#8208;doped spatially asymmetric single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;NS SA) exhibit stronger oxidase activities, including peroxidase (POD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOx), L&#8208;cysteine oxidase (LCO), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), which can cause enough reactive oxygen species (ROS) storms to trigger pyroptosis. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;NS SA, UK5099, and POx can target pyruvate metabolism, which not only improves the immune TME but also increases the degree of pyroptosis. This study provides a two&#8208;pronged treatment strategy that can significantly activate antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, NADH/glutathione/L&#8208;cysteine consumption, pyruvate oxidation, and lactic acid (LA)/ATP depletion, triggering pyroptosis and regulating metabolism. This work provides a broad vision for expanding antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Microalgae&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Associated Anxiety and Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral microalgae&#8208;based hydrogel is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease and its associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. The hydrogel can reduce intestinal inflammation, maintain intestinal homeostasis, and inhibit neuroinflammation, then significantly alleviate the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the etiology of psychiatric disorders associated with IBD remains uncertain, and an efficacious treatment approach has yet to be established. Herein, an oral hydrogel strategy (SP@Rh&#8208;gel) is proposed for co&#8208;delivery of Spirulina platensis and rhein to treat IBD and IBD&#8208;associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. SP@Rh&#8208;gel improves the solubility, release characteristics and intestinal retention capacity of the drug, leading to a significant improvement in the oral therapeutic efficacy. Oral administration of SP@Rh&#8208;gel can reduce intestinal inflammation and rebalance the disrupted intestinal microbial community. Furthermore, SP@Rh&#8208;gel maintains intestinal barrier integrity and reduces the release of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and their entry into the hippocampus through the blood&#8208;brain barrier, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining neuroplasticity. SP@Rh&#8208;gel significantly alleviates the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors, in a chronic colitis mouse model. This study demonstrates the significant involvement of the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis in the development of IBD with psychiatric disorders and proposes a safe, simple, and highly efficient therapeutic approach for managing IBD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Leveraging the differences in binding energy after coordination between anions in DES and transition metals, as well as the differences in Gibbs free energy of different coordination structures in acetone, an efficient and cost&#8208;effective system is designed for the selective recovery of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Owing to continuing global use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in particular in electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need for sustainable recycling of spent LIBs. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are reported as &#8220;green solvents&#8221; for low&#8208;cost and sustainable recycling. However, the lack of understanding of the coordination mechanisms between DESs and transition metals (Ni, Mn and Co) and Li makes selective separation of transition metals with similar physicochemical properties practically difficult. Here, it is found that the transition metals and Li have a different stable coordination structure with the different anions in DES during leaching. Further, based on the different solubility of these coordination structures in anti&#8208;solvent (acetone), a leaching and separation process system is designed, which enables high selective recovery of transition metals and Li from spent cathode LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111), with recovery of acetone. Recovery of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode is also evidenced and a significant selective recovery for Co and Li is established, together with recovery and reuse of acetone and DES. It is concluded that the tuning of cation&#8211;anion coordination structure and anti&#8208;solvent crystallization are practical for selective recovery of critical metal resources in the spent LIBs recycling.

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the differences in binding energy after coordination between anions in DES and transition metals, as well as the differences in Gibbs free energy of different coordination structures in acetone, an efficient and cost-effective system is designed for the selective recovery of transition metal ions.

         <title>COF/In2S3 S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst with Enhanced Light Absorption and H2O2&#8208;Production Activity and fs&#8208;TA Investigation</title>

The S&#8208;scheme covalent organic framwork (COF)/In2S3 photocatalysts prepared in this work exhibit remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and high&#8208;performance H2O2 synthesis from air and pure water. Experimental and theoretical results reveal the formation of hybrid energy levels that greatly extends the photoresponse range. The S&#8208;scheme carrier transfer mechanism and multipathways for H2O2 formation are identified. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction and extended light&#8208;harvesting range result in exceptional photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis from water and O2 is an economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable route for H2O2 production. However, single&#8208;component photocatalysts are subjected to limited light&#8208;harvesting range, fast carrier recombination, and weak redox power. To promote photogenerated carrier separation and enhance redox abilities, an organic/inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is fabricated by in situ growing In2S3 nanosheets on a covalent organic framwork (COF) substrate for efficient H2O2 production in pure water. Interestingly, compared to unitary COF and In2S3, the COF/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts exhibit significantly larger light&#8208;harvesting range and stronger visible&#8208;light absorption. Partial density of state calculation, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveal that the coordination between In2S3 and COF induces the formation of mid&#8208;gap hybrid energy levels, leading to smaller energy gaps and broadened absorption. Combining electron spin resonance spectroscopy, radical&#8208;trapping experiments, and isotope labeling experiments, three pathways for H2O2 formation are identified. Benefited from expanded light&#8208;absorption range, enhanced carrier separation, strong redox power, and multichannel H2O2 formation, the optimal composite shows an impressive H2O2&#8208;production rate of 5713.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. This work exemplifies an effective strategy to ameliorate COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by building S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into their impact on energy level modulation.

Dynamic Acoustic Beamshaping
Coupling&#8208;immune acoustic moir&#233; metasurfaces are first proposed in acoustics to achieve remote moir&#233; effects decoupled from the interlayer distance. Twist&#8208;angle&#8208;controlled dynamic acoustic beam shaping will significantly enhance the practical applications of moir&#233; devices in remote dynamic detection and multiplexed underwater acoustic communication. More details can be found in article number 2313004 by Yan&#8208;Feng Wang, Yue&#8208;Sheng Wang, Cheng&#8208;Wei Qiu, and co&#8208;workers.

Space&#8208;Efficient Microalgae Farming
Photosynthetic microalgae are a sustainable food source without using arable land. However, challenges such as light self&#8208;shading, excessive water use, and insufficient space utilization hinder their farming as regenerative food solutions. In article number 2401172, Jiajing Zhou, Wei Lin, Joseph J Richardson, and co&#8208;workers develop a hydrogel scaffold for vertical microalgae farming, which enables the rational design of culture systems with improved light, water, and space utilization to reduce physical footprints of food production.

In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202401172"&gt;2401172&lt;/a&gt;, Jiajing Zhou, Wei Lin, Joseph J Richardson, and co-workers develop a hydrogel scaffold for vertical microalgae farming, which enables the rational design of culture systems with improved light, water, and space utilization to reduce physical footprints of food production.

Topological Spin Textures
Implementation of magnets with low&#8208;damping, minimum Joule heating and tunable topological spin properties consist one of the main goals towards novel information storage technologies. In article number 2311949, Sergey Grebenchuk, Elton J. G. Santos, Maciej Koperski, and co&#8208;workers report that a wide variety of topological magnetic textures can be created and controlled on&#8208;demand on CrBr3 van der Waals magnet insulators at different thicknesses, temperatures and external excitations, such as energy&#8208;efficient optical excitations.

Self&#8208;Assembled Lipidated Peptide Nanomaterials
&#946;&#8208;Peptides have great potential as novel biomaterials and therapeutic agents due to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into low dimensional nanostructures resistant to degradation in vivo. Irene Yarovsky and co&#8208;workers develop a computational approach to model self&#8208;assembled &#946;&#8208;peptide nanostructures in all atom detail showing good agreement with X&#8208;ray fiber diffraction and AFM data. The synergistic approach will be useful for designing peptide nanomaterials for biomedical and engineering applications. More details can be found in article number 2311103.

Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnets
In article number 2313763, Xudong Huai, Thao Tran, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a framework for designing triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals and electronic states for CaMnTeO6 result in strong quantum fluctuations. This work provides a powerful tool for enhancing coherent quantum dynamics in innovative materials, a necessary step for future solid&#8208;state quantum computing.

         <title>Biocompatible 2D Materials via Liquid Phase Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials can be effectively produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) using different conditions. LPE generates 2D materials in aqueous solutions, represented by graphene, black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, and possess a huge potential in the biomedical domain, spanning cancer therapy, drug delivery as well as antimicrobial and biosensing.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs), such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (BP), have been proposed for different types of bioapplications, owing to their unique physicochemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), as one of the most effective up&#8208;scalable and size&#8208;controllable methods, is becoming the standard process to produce high quantities of various 2DM types as it can benefit from the use of green and biocompatible conditions. The resulting exfoliated layered materials have garnered significant attention because of their biocompatibility and their potential use in biomedicine as new multimodal therapeutics, antimicrobials, and biosensors.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks Toward Advanced Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the relationship between COF structures and their applications in different zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs), outlining the optimal mechanisms in improving electrochemical performance. Taking the structural diversity as a starting point, it is an opportune time to summarize the similarities among different COF&#8208;correlated materials to suppress electrode&#8208;related issues and delineate their distinctions in different&#160;ZBBs.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have demonstrated considerable potential among secondary batteries, attributing to their advantages including good safety, environmental friendliness, and high energy density. However, ZBBs still suffer from issues such as the formation of zinc dendrites, occurrence of side reactions, retardation of reaction kinetics, and shuttle effects, posing a great challenge for practical applications. As promising porous materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives have rigid skeletons, ordered structures, and permanent porosity, which endow them with great potential for application in ZBBs. This review, therefore, provides a systematic overview detailing on COFs structure pertaining to electrochemical performance of ZBBs, following an in depth discussion of the challenges faced by ZBBs, which includes dendrites and side reactions at the anode, as well as dissolution, structural change, slow kinetics, and shuttle effect at the cathode. Then, the structural advantages of COF&#8208;correlated materials and their roles in various ZBBs are highlighted. Finally, the challenges of COF&#8208;correlated materials in ZBBs are outlined and an outlook on the future development of COF&#8208;correlated materials for ZBBs is provided. The review would serve as a valuable reference for further research into the utilization of COF&#8208;correlated materials in ZBBs.

         <title>General Design Concept of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects, electronic properties, support and interface effects, coordination environment of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) and SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts play an important role in the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship of SASCs in 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR are discussed by combining characterization techniques and theoretical calculation.








Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environment&#8208;friendly features. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalysts for the in&#8208;depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship. In this review, the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&#8722; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years, are summarized. First, the elementary steps of the two pathways and the roles of key intermediates (*OOH and *OH) in the reactions are systematically discussed. Next, the influence of the size effect, electronic structure regulation, the support/interfacial effect, the optimization of coordination microenvironments, and the SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts applied in 2e&#8722; ORR are systematically analyzed. Besides, the developments of SASCs in 2e&#8722; WOR are also overviewed. Finally, the research progress of H2O2 electrosynthesis on SASCs is concluded, and an outlook on the rational design of SASCs is presented in conjunction with the design strategies and characterization techniques.

&lt;p&gt;The size effects, electronic properties, support and interface effects, coordination environment of single-atom-site catalysts (SASCs) and SASCs-derived catalysts play an important role in the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mechanism and structure-performance relationship of SASCs in 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR are discussed by combining characterization techniques and theoretical calculation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environment-friendly features. Single-atom-site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalysts for the in-depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure-performance relationship. In this review, the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years, are summarized.

         <title>Structural Design for EMI Shielding: From Underlying Mechanisms to Common Pitfalls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 24, June 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve absorption&#8208;dominant electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields, detailed structural design is essential. This review examines various shielding configurations such as polymer nanocomposites, thin films, porous frameworks, multilayer constructs, and 3D&#8208;printed structures. It highlights key considerations for creating effective shields, explains fundamental shielding mechanisms, and addresses common misconceptions in EMI shielding science.








Abstract
Modern human civilization deeply relies on the rapid advancement of cutting&#8208;edge electronic systems that have revolutionized communication, education, aviation, and entertainment. However, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by digital systems poses a significant threat to the society, potentially leading to a future crisis. While numerous efforts are made to develop nanotechnological shielding systems to mitigate the detrimental effects of EMI, there is limited focus on creating absorption&#8208;dominant shielding solutions. Achieving absorption&#8208;dominant EMI shields requires careful structural design engineering, starting from the smallest components and considering the most effective electromagnetic wave attenuating factors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of shielding structures, emphasizing the critical elements of absorption&#8208;dominant shielding design, shielding mechanisms, limitations of both traditional and nanotechnological EMI shields, and common misconceptions about the foundational principles of EMI shielding science. This systematic review serves as a scientific guide for designing shielding structures that prioritize absorption, highlighting an often&#8208;overlooked aspect of shielding science.

         <title>Phospholipid Membranes as Chemically and Functionally Tunable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular membranes feature a couple of unique properties to control various biological functions at this interface. Protein function can be modulated by specific lipids directly or by bulk membrane properties. Using this principle, a number of advanced membrane&#8208;based applications are conceivable where the membrane acts as a modulator of biological function.








Abstract
The sheet&#8208;like lipid bilayer is the fundamental structural component of all cell membranes. Its building blocks are phospholipids and cholesterol. Their amphiphilic structure spontaneously leads to the formation of a bilayer in aqueous environment. Lipids are not just structural elements. Individual lipid species, the lipid membrane structure, and lipid dynamics influence and regulate membrane protein function. An exciting field is emerging where the membrane&#8208;associated material properties of different bilayer systems are used in designing innovative solutions for widespread applications across various fields, such as the food industry, cosmetics, nano&#8208; and biomedicine, drug storage and delivery, biotechnology, nano&#8208; and biosensors, and computing. Here, the authors summarize what is known about how lipids determine the properties and functions of biological membranes and how this has been or can be translated into innovative applications. Based on recent progress in the understanding of membrane structure, dynamics, and physical properties, a perspective is provided on how membrane&#8208;controlled regulation of protein functions can extend current applications and even offer new applications.

         <title>Mixing Insulating Commodity Polymers with Semiconducting n&#8208;type Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating commodity polymers are mixed with an n&#8208;type conjugated polymer to increase the performance of organic electrochemical transistors. Blending the conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with large amounts of 10 kDa polystyrene (1:6 in monomer weight) led to an increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude and device stability by 65% with respect to the pristine conjugated polymer.








Abstract
Diluting organic semiconductors with a host insulating polymer is used to increase the electronic mobility in organic electronic devices, such as thin film transistors, while considerably reducing material costs. In contrast to organic electronics, bioelectronic devices such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) rely on both electronic and ionic mobility for efficient operation, making it challenging to integrate hydrophobic polymers as the predominant blend component. This work shows that diluting the n&#8208;type conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with high molecular weight polystyrene (10&#160;KDa) leads to OECTs with over three times better mobility&#8208;volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) with respect to the pristine p(N&#8208;T) (from 4.3 to 13.4 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) while drastically decreasing the amount of conjugated polymer (six times less). This improvement in &#181;C* is due to a dramatic increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude, from 0.059 to 1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p(N&#8208;T):Polystyrene 10 KDa 1:6. Moreover, devices made with this polymer blend show better stability, retaining 77% of the initial drain current after 60 minutes operation in contrast to 12% for pristine p(N&#8208;T). These results open a new generation of low&#8208;cost organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors where the bulk of the film is made by a commodity polymer.

&lt;p&gt;Insulating commodity polymers are mixed with an n-type conjugated polymer to increase the performance of organic electrochemical transistors. Blending the conjugated polymer p(N-T) with large amounts of 10 kDa polystyrene (1:6 in monomer weight) led to an increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude and device stability by 65% with respect to the pristine conjugated polymer.

         <title>3D Nanostructuring of Phase&#8208;Change Materials Using Focused Ion Beam toward Versatile Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local nanostructuring of phase&#8208;change thin films using a focused ion beam (FIB) is reported. The accurate control of FIB's milling/sputtering power for height/depth variations produces vibrant structural colors. The phase&#8208;switching of the active Sb2Se3 thin film provides additional contrast formation. The reported technique allows for the formation of super&#8208;resolution images with small pixel sizes.








Abstract
In recent&#160;years, phase&#8208;change materials have gained importance in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. Sizable optical contrast and added degree of freedom from phase switching drive the use of phase&#8208;change materials in various optical devices with outstanding results and potential for real&#8208;world applications. The local crystallization/amorphization of phase&#8208;change materials and the corresponding reflectance tuning by the crystallized/amorphized region size have potential applications, for example, for future dynamic display devices. Although the resolution is much higher than in current display devices, the pixel sizes in those devices are limited by the locally switchable structure size. Here, the spot sizes are further reduced by using ion beams instead of laser beams, dramatically increasing pixel density, demonstrating superior resolution. In addition, the power to sputter away materials can be utilized in creating nanostructures with relative height differences and local contrast. The experiment focuses on one archetypal phase&#8208;change material, Sb2Se3, prepared by pulsed&#8208;laser deposition on a reflective gold substrate. This study demonstrates that structural colors can be produced and reflectance tuning can be achieved by focused ion beam milling/sputtering of phase&#8208;change materials at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the local structuring of phase&#8208;change materials by focused ion beam can produce high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density display devices with superior resolutions.

         <title>Engineering of Local Coordination Microenvironment in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enabling Sustainable Conversion of Biomass into a Broad Range of Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst with highly active Pd&#8208;N3&#8208;Bx sites is facilely synthesized via a supramolecular controlled pyrolysis strategy. The local coordination microenvironment between Pd and N guarantees the formation of Pd&#8208;N3 active sites, whereas the self&#8208;doping B effectively adjusts the charge distribution around Pd&#8208;N3 sites. The resulting Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits outstanding activity toward converting the lignocellulosic biomass into amines.








Abstract
Utilizing renewable biomass as a substitute for fossil resources to produce high&#8208;value chemicals with a low carbon footprint is an effective strategy for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Production of chemicals via single&#8208;atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, a supramolecular&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy is employed to fabricate a palladium single&#8208;atom (Pd1/BNC) catalyst with B&#8208;doped Pd&#8208;Nx atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes/ketones. Thorough characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly polar metal&#8208;N&#8208;B site, formed between the central Pd single atom and its adjacent N and B atoms, promotes hydrogen activation from the donor (reductants) and hydrogen transfer to the acceptor (C&#9552;O group), consequently leading to exceptional selectivity. This system can be further extended to directly synthesize various aromatic and furonic amines from renewable lignocellulosic biomass, with their greenhouse gas emission potentials being negative in comparison to those of fossil&#8208;fuel resource&#8208;based amines. This research presents a highly effective and sustainable methodology for constructing C&#9472;N bonds, enabling the production of a diverse array of amines from carbon&#8208;neutral biomass resources.

         <dc:description>
Anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;resistive switching with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated in a device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO.








Abstract
Exploring potential spintronic functionalities in resistive switching (RS) devices is of great interest for creating new applications, such as multifunctional resistive random&#8208;access memory and novel neuromorphic computing devices. In particular, the importance of the spin&#8208;triplet state of cation vacancies in oxide materials, which is induced by localized and strong O&#8211;2p on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions, in RS devices has been overlooked. d0 ferromagnetism sometimes appears due to the spin&#8208;triplet state and ferromagnetic Zener's double exchange interactions between cation vacancies, which are occasionally strong enough to make nonmagnetic oxides ferromagnetic. Here, for the first time, anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;RS (CMRS) with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated by utilizing an unconventional RS device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The device shows colossal and unusual behavior as the threshold voltage and ON/OFF ratio strongly depend on a magnetic field, which is controllable with an applied voltage. This new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO. The findings will allow the development of energy&#8208;efficient CMRS devices with multifield susceptibility.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy Reveals Na Infiltration into Separator Pore Free&#8208;Volume as a Degradation Mechanism in Na Anode:Liquid Electrolyte Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;sectional cryo&#8208;electron microscopy of full intact Na anode electrochemical cells reveals deeper understanding of degradation mechanism during electrochemical plating and stripping with liquid electrolytes. Na is observed to infiltrate the separator by growing into the free volume space of its pores rather than mechanical puncturing by dendrites.








Abstract
Batteries utilizing a sodium (Na) metal anode with a liquid electrolyte are promising for affordable large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, a deep understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanisms is limited by challenges in accessing the buried interfaces. Here, cryogenic electron microscopy&#160;of intact electrode:separator:electrode stacks is performed and degradation and failure of symmetric Na||Na coin cells occurs through the infiltration of Na metal through the&#160;pores of the separator rather than by mechanical puncturing by dendrites is revealed. It is shown the interior structure of the cell (electrode:separator:electrode) must be preserved and&#160;deconstructing the cell into different layers for characterization results in artifacts. In intact cell stacks, minimal liquid is found between the electrodes and separator, leading to intimate electrode:separator interfaces. After electrochemical cycling, Na infiltrates into the pore free&#8208;volume, growing through the separator to create electrical shorts and degradation. The Na infiltration occurs at interfacial regions devoid of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), revealing SEI plays an important role in preventing Na from growing into the separator by being a physical barrier that the plated Na cannot penetrate.

     alt="Cryo-Electron Microscopy Reveals Na Infiltration into Separator Pore Free-Volume as a Degradation Mechanism in Na Anode:Liquid Electrolyte Electrochemical Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional cryo-electron microscopy of full intact Na anode electrochemical cells reveals deeper understanding of degradation mechanism during electrochemical plating and stripping with liquid electrolytes. Na is observed to infiltrate the separator by growing into the free volume space of its pores rather than mechanical puncturing by dendrites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries utilizing a sodium (Na) metal anode with a liquid electrolyte are promising for affordable large-scale energy storage. However, a deep understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanisms is limited by challenges in accessing the buried interfaces. Here, cryogenic electron microscopy&#160;of intact electrode:separator:electrode stacks is performed and degradation and failure of symmetric Na||Na coin cells occurs through the infiltration of Na metal through the&#160;pores of the separator rather than by mechanical puncturing by dendrites is revealed. It is shown the interior structure of the cell (electrode:separator:electrode) must be preserved and&#160;deconstructing the cell into different layers for characterization results in artifacts. In intact cell stacks, minimal liquid is found between the electrodes and separator, leading to intimate electrode:separator interfaces. After electrochemical cycling, Na infiltrates into the pore free-volume, growing through the separator to create electrical shorts and degradation. The Na infiltration occurs at interfacial regions devoid of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), revealing SEI plays an important role in preventing Na from growing into the separator by being a physical barrier that the plated Na cannot penetrate. These results shed new light on the fundamental failure mechanisms in Na batteries and demonstrate the importance of preserving the cell structure and buried interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silk&#8208;Fabric Reinforced Silk for Artificial Bones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) is prepared via a hot&#8208;pressing approach with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. SFS with a perfect interface has excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. SFS has great potential to replace commercial metal or ceramic implants to be used in the field of medical fracture repair.








Abstract
Bone implants for different body parts require varying mechanical properties, dimensions, and biodegradability rates. Currently, it is still challenging to produce artificial bones with perfect compatibility with human bones. In this study, a silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) composed of pure silk with exceptional biocompatibility, osteogenesis, and biodegradability is reported, and demonstrates its outstanding performance as a bone implant material. The SFS is fabricated using a simple hot&#8208;pressing technique, with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. The SFS as a self&#8208;reinforced composite, has exceptional mechanical properties due to the almost perfect interface between the matrix and reinforcement. More importantly, its mechanical properties, biodegradability rates, and density can be tailored by adjusting the reinforcement structure and the ratio of the reinforcement to the matrix to align with the requirements for bone implantation in different parts of the human body. Besides, the SFS can improve osteoblastic proliferation and increase osteogenic activity, which is not the case with clinically used titanium alloy artificial bone. Therefore, the SFS holds significant potential to replace conventional metal or ceramic implants in the field of medical fracture repair.

         <title>Overcoming the Unfavorable Effects of &#8220;Boltzmann Tyranny:&#8221; Ultra&#8208;Low Subthreshold Swing in Organic Phototransistors via One&#8208;Transistor&#8208;One&#8208;Memristor Architecture</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the 60&#160;mV/dec limit in the subthreshold swing (SS) in conventional organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SS of 18&#160;mV/decade.








Abstract
Organic phototransistors (OPTs), as photosensitive organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), have gained significant attention due to their pivotal roles in imaging, optical communication, and night vision. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, which constrains the average subthreshold swing (SSave) to a minimum of 60&#160;mV/decade at room temperature. In this study, an innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the Boltzmann limit in conventional OFETs. By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SSave of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 109&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 104&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra&#8208;low SSave devices in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Bioengineered Ionic Liquid for Catheter&#8208;Directed Tissue Ablation, Drug Delivery, and Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catheter&#8208;directed ILE is bioengineered and tested in animal models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, achieving chemical segmentectomy, improving the delivery of therapeutics, preventing infectious complications, and potentially increasing chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.








Abstract
Delivery of therapeutics to solid tumors with high bioavailability remains a challenge and is likely the main contributor to the ineffectiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, a catheter&#8208;directed ionic liquid embolic (ILE) is bioengineered to achieve durable vascular embolization, uniform tissue ablation, and drug delivery in non&#8208;survival and survival porcine models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. To simulate the clinical scenario, rabbit VX2 orthotopic liver tumors are treated showing successful trans&#8208;arterial delivery of Nivolumab and effective tumor ablation. Furthermore, similar results are also observed in human ex vivo tumor tissue as well as significant susceptibility of highly resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria is seen to ILE, suggesting that ILE can prevent abscess formation in embolized tissue. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, improve the delivery of therapeutics, prevent infectious complications, and potentially increase chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.

         <title>Actuating Liquid Crystals Rapidly and Reversibly by Using Chemical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical energy (fuels) and catalysis are used to drive reversible microactuation of liquid crystals and microbeads dispersed within them. Surface catalyzed reactions between H2 and O2 on Pd/Au surfaces are shown to drive rapid (occur within a second) and reversible reorientation of LCs over many cycles, resulting in reversible microactuation of beads using LC elastic forces.








Abstract
Microtubules and catalytic motor proteins underlie the microscale actuation of living materials, and they have been used in reconstituted systems to harness chemical energy to drive new states of organization of soft matter (e.g., liquid crystals (LCs)). Such materials, however, are fragile and challenging to translate to technological contexts. Rapid (sub&#8208;second) and reversible changes in the orientations of LCs at room temperature using reactions between gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are catalyzed by Pd/Au surfaces are reported. Surface chemical analysis and computational chemistry studies confirm that dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Pd/Au films reduces preadsorbed O and generates 1 ML of adsorbed H, driving nitrile&#8208;containing LCs from a perpendicular to a planar orientation. Subsequent exposure to O2 leads to oxidation of the adsorbed H, reformation of adsorbed O on the Pd/Au surface, and a return of the LC to its initial orientation. The roles of surface composition and reaction kinetics in determining the LC dynamics are described along with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of microactuation of beads. These results provide fresh ideas for utilizing chemical energy and catalysis to reversibly actuate functional LCs on the microscale.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an injectable T cell&#8208;stimulating scaffold, the artificial lymph node (aLN), is developed that works with the host immune system to create an immunostimulatory niche. The aLN&#160;can activate and expand rare, antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells from fully na&#239;ve, endogenous populations. aLN stimulated cells are fully functional and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival.








Abstract
T cells are critical mediators of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for immunotherapy. Biomaterial scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix is created, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation, as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild&#8208;type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

         <title>Spatial Photo&#8208;Patterning of Nematic Liquid Crystal Pretilt and its Application in Fabricating Flat Gradient&#8208;Index Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for 3D control of liquid crystal mesogens' orientation. A two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process sets both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation, enabling smooth orientational patterns, and can generate stable gradient&#8208;index lenses without the need for an applied fields. The method shows promise for creating advanced photonics, re&#8208;configurable optical devices, and actuated materials.








Abstract
Liquid crystals offer a dynamic platform for developing advanced photonics and soft actuation systems due to their unique and facile tunability and reconfigurability. Achieving precise spatial patterning of the liquid crystal alignment is critical to developing electro&#8208;optical devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling active matter. Here, a simple method is demonstrated to achieve continuous 3D control of the directions of liquid crystal mesogens using a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process. In the first step, polarized light sets the orientation in the plane of confining substrates; the second step uses unpolarized light of a prescribed dose to set the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. The method enables smoothly varying orientational patterns with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. As a demonstration, the setup is used to create gradient&#8208;index lenses with parabolic refractive index profiles that remain stable without external electric fields. The lenses' focal length and sensitivity to light polarization are characterized through experimental and numerical methods. The findings pave the way for developing next&#8208;generation photonic devices and actuated materials, with potential applications in molecular self&#8208;assembly, re&#8208;configurable optics, and responsive&#160;matter.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Manganese&#8208;Based Bacterial Materials Synergistically Activate the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG) that exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is successfully engineered. This work provides valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Stimulating the cyclic guanosine monophophate(GMP)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a crucial strategy by which bacteria activate the tumor immune system. However, the limited stimulation capability poses significant challenges in advancing bacterial immunotherapy. Here, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG (polyethylene glycol)) is engineered successfully, which exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by elevated ATP levels, this biohybrid material degrades, resulting in the release of divalent manganese ions (Mn2+) and subsequent bacteria exposure. This combination synergistically activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, as Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to the extracellular DNA (eDNA) secreted by the bacteria. The results of the in vivo experiments demonstrate that the biohybrid materials E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG and VNP20009@PDMC&#8208;PEG effectively inhibit the growth of subcutaneous melanoma in mice and in situ liver cancer in rabbits. Valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are provided here.

         <title>Molecular Design for Vertical Phase Distribution Modulation in High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effect of side&#8208;chain polarity on organic solar cells (OSCs) performance by synthesizing two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E. It shows that side&#8208;chain polarity influences component distribution within the photoactive layer, affecting excitation energy levels and charge transport. Incorporating ITIC&#8208;E significantly enhances power conversion efficiency to 19.4%, highlighting side&#8208;chain manipulation as a key strategy for OSC enhancement.








Abstract
Component distribution within the photoactive layer dictates the morphology and electronic structure and substantially influences the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a molecular design strategy is introduced to manipulate component and energetics distribution by adjusting side&#8208;chain polarity. Two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E, are synthesized by introducing different polar functional substituents onto the side chains of ITIC. The alterations result in different distribution tendencies in the bulk heterojunction film: ITIC&#8208;16F with intensified hydrophobicity aligns predominantly with the top surface, while ITIC&#8208;E with strong hydrophilicity gravitates toward the bottom. This divergence directly impacts the vertical distribution of the excitation energy levels, thereby influencing the excitation kinetics over extended time periods and larger spatial ranges including enhanced diffusion&#8208;mediated exciton dissociation and stimulated charge carrier transport. Benefitting from the favorable energy distribution, the device incorporating ITIC&#8208;E into the PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl blend showcases an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.4%. This work highlights side&#8208;chain polarity manipulation as a promising strategy for designing efficient NFA molecules and underscores the pivotal role of spatial energetics distribution in OSC performance.

         <title>The LiV3O8 Superlattice Cathode with Optimized Zinc Ion Insertion Chemistry for High Mass&#8208;Loading Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of zinc&#8208;ion batteries depends on resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ and enhancing mass&#8208;loading performance. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets with enlarged interlayer spacing are manufactured to provide a large&#8208;rate and stable lifetime due to optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry. Superior high mass&#8208;loading performance highlights superlattice electrode design strategy and PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 cathode application potential.








Abstract
Resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ in the cathode lattice and improving mass&#8208;loading performance are crucial for advancing the zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) application. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets (PEO&#8208;LVO) with expanded interlayer spacing (1.16&#160;nm) are fabricated to provide a high&#8208;rate, stable lifetime, and large mass&#8208;loading cathode. The steady in&#8208;plane expansion without shrinkage after the first cycle, but reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion in PEO&#8208;LVO are demonstrated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ characterizations. Moreover, the large capacity of PEO&#8208;LVO is traced back to the optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry with increased Zn2+ storage ratio, which is facilitated by the interlayer PEO in lowering the Zn2+ diffusion barrier and increased number of active sites from additional interfaces, as anticipated by density functional theory. Due to the optimized ion insertion resulting in stalled interfacial byproducts and rapid kinetics, PEO&#8208;LVO achieves excellent high mass&#8208;loading performance (areal capacity up to 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2 for freestanding electrode with 24&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading and 2.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 130&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for conventional electrode with 27&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped AZIBs with high mass&#8208;loading woven into a fabric can power an electronic watch, highlighting the application potential of PEO&#8208;LVO cathode.

         <title>Engineered Surfaces That Promote Capture of Latent Proteins to Facilitate Integrin&#8208;Mediated Mechanical Activation of Growth Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta&#8208;1 for its subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.








Abstract
Conventional osteogenic platforms utilize active growth factors to repair bone defects that are extensive in size, but they can adversely affect patient health. Here, an unconventional osteogenic platform is reported that functions by promoting capture of inactive osteogenic growth factor molecules to the site of cell growth for subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation, using a recombinant fragment of latent transforming growth factor beta&#8208;binding protein&#8208;1 (rLTBP1). It is shown that rLTBP1 binds to the growth&#8208;factor&#8208; and integrin&#8208;binding domains of fibronectin on poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces, which immobilizes rLTBP1 and promotes the binding of latency associated peptide (LAP), within which inactive transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) is bound. rLTBP1 facilitates the interaction of LAP with integrin &#946;1 and the subsequent mechanically driven release of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 to stimulate canonical TGF&#8208;&#946;1 signaling, activating osteogenic marker expression in vitro and complete regeneration of a critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Nanoribbons and Their Heterostructures via Assembly of Mass&#8208;Selected Inorganic Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottom&#8208;up fabrication of materials inaccessible by conventional thermal sublimation techniques is demonstrated. Mass&#8208;selected ionic building blocks generated by electrospray ionization are soft&#8208;landed at a substrate, generating nanostructures that are subsequently examined by electron microscopy. As the first example, MoS and WS ions are used to show fabrication of micrometer&#8208;long and nanometer&#8208;wide MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene.








Abstract
Control of nanomaterial dimensions with atomic precision through synthetic methods is essential to understanding and engineering of nanomaterials. For single&#8208;layer inorganic materials, size and shape controls have been achieved by self&#8208;assembly and surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions of building blocks deposited at a surface. However, the scope of nanostructures accessible by such approach is restricted by the limited choice of building blocks that can be thermally evaporated onto surfaces, such as atoms or thermostable molecules. Herein this limitation is bypassed by using mass&#8208;selected molecular ions obtained via electrospray ionization as building blocks to synthesize nanostructures that are inaccessible by conventional evaporation methods. As the first example, micron&#8208;scale production of MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene are shown by the self&#8208;assembly of asymmetrically shaped building blocks obtained from the electrospray. It is expected that judicious use of electrospray&#8208;generated building blocks would unlock access to previously inaccessible inorganic nanostructures.

         <title>Revealing Seed&#8208;Mediated Structural Evolution of Copper&#8208;Silicide Nanostructures: Generating Structured Current Collectors for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth mechanism behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures directly on Cu foil is elucidated, where the temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The Cu diffusion kinetics guide the morphological progression of silicides, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide nanowires proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process.








Abstract
Metal silicide thin films and nanostructures typically employed in electronics have recently gained significant attention in battery technology, where they are used as active or inactive materials. However, unlike thin films, the science behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures, especially 1D nanowires (NWs), is a key missing aspect. CuxSiy nanostructures synthesized by solvent vapor growth technique are studied as a model system to gain insights into metal silicide formation. The temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy structures proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The role of Cu diffusion kinetics on the morphological progression of Cu silicides is studied, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide NWs proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process. The different CuxSiy morphologies synthesized are utilized as structured current collectors for K&#8208;ion battery anodes. Sb deposited by thermal evaporation upon Cu15Si4 tripod NWs and cube architectures exhibit reversible alloying capacities of 477.3 and 477.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at a C/5 rate. Furthermore, Sb deposited Cu15Si4 tripod NWs anode tested in Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries demonstrate reversible capacities of &#8776;518 and 495 mAh g&#8722;1.

A hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ)&#160;is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds, which can target tumors and achieve specific drug release in tumors. The powerful nanotherapy system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy possesses satisfactory oncolytic efficacy for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD&#8208;SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C70 consuming O2 for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C70&#8208;mediated PDT and hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia&#8208;sensitive system&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD&#8208;SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene&#8208;based hypoxia&#8208;sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors can provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction between Metal Single&#8208;Atoms and Defective WO3&#8722;x Nanosheets for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of a strong synergistic effect between metal single&#8208;atoms and oxygen vacancies of WO3&#8722;x nanosheets can effectively boost the sonodyanimc therapy performance under ultrasound irradiation, thus realizing highly efficient cancer treatment.








Abstract
Although metal single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based nanomaterials are explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to generate a synergistic effect for efficient SDT is reported. Crystalline WO3 and OV&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets are first prepared by simple calcination of the WO3&#183;H2O nanosheets under an air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Pt, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni metal SAs are then deposited on WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to obtain metal SA&#8208;decorated WO3&#8722;x nanocomposites (M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x). Importantly, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x sonosensitizer exhibits a much higher activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced production of reactive oxygen species than that of the WO3&#8722;x and Cu SA&#8208;decorated WO3, which is also higher than other M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the excellent SDT performance of the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu SAs and WO3&#8722;x OVs. Therefore, after polyethylene glycol modification, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x can quickly kill cancer cells in vitro and effectively eradicate tumors in vivo under US irradiation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation suggest that the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x&#8208;mediated SDT&#8208;activated apoptosis and TNF signaling pathways are potential drivers of tumor apoptosis induction.

         <title>Ptychographic Nanoscale Imaging of the Magnetoelectric Coupling in Freestanding BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferroelectric and magnetic structure of a freestanding thin film of multiferroic bismuth ferrite are imaged with soft x&#8208;ray ptychography at the Fe L&#8208;edge. This scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique directly visualizes the strong magnetoelectric coupling between the antiferromagnetic spin cycloid and ferroelectric domains on the nanoscale.








Abstract
Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X&#8208;ray ptychography is employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80&#160;nm thin freestanding film of the room&#8208;temperature multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64&#160;nm is resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X&#8208;ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic&#8208;like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L3 edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in&#8208;plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71&#176;&#160;between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain&#8208;free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non&#8208;collinear magnetic materials with soft&#160;X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Octadecyl Gallate and Lipid&#8208;Modified MnSe2 Nanoparticles Enhance Radiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Promote Radioprotection in Normal Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using transcriptome data. Therefore, MnSe2&#8208;lipid with uniform sphere morphology and pH&#8208;responsive property is designed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosenstivity and Se element reduces side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a widely used therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is always limited by radioresistance of tumor tissues and side&#8208;effects on normal tissues. Herein, a signature based on four core genes of cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, is developed to predict prognosis and assess immune cell infiltration, indicating that the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in ESCC. A novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness is developed to simultaneously overcome radioresistance and reduce side&#8208;effects of radiation. The uniform MnSe2 encapsulated lipid effectively achieves tumor accumulation. Octadecyl gallate on surface of MnSe2 forming pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;phenolic covalent realizes rapid degradation in TME. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response by promoting secretion of cytokines and increasing white blood cells, and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy. Overall, this multifunctional remedy which is responsive to TME is capable of providing radiosensitivity by cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated immunostimulation and chemodynamic therapy, and radioprotection of normal tissues, is highlighted here to optimize ESCC treatment.

         <title>Supramolecular Lipid Nanoparticles Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition: A New Generation Delivery System of mRNA Vaccines For Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) are developed to codeliver mRNA and an adjuvant (R848) through host&#8722;guest recognition, showing brilliant potentials in cancer immunotherapy. SMLNP@mRNAOVA/R848 significantly increases the translation efficiency, stimulates DC maturation, and promotes antigen presentation, thus eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Excitingly, the antitumor performances of mRNA vaccine are further potentiated by synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is a crucial process for antigen presentation and the initiation of T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses. Toll&#8208;like receptors play pivotal roles in stimulating DC maturation and promoting antigen presentation. Here, a novel message RNA (mRNA) cancer vaccine is reported that boosts antitumor efficacy by codelivering an mRNA encoding tumor antigen and a TLR7/8 agonist (R848) to DC using supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) as a delivery platform, in which a new ionizable lipid (N2&#8208;3L) remarkably enhances the translation efficiency of mRNA and a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified ionizable lipid (Lip&#8208;CD) encapsulates R848. The incorporation of R848 adjuvant into the mRNA vaccine through noncovalent host&#8211;guest complexation significantly promotes DC maturation and antigen presentation after vaccination, thus resulting in superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy is further boosted synergized with immune checkpoint blockade by potentiating the anticancer capability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrated in tumor sites. This work indicates that SMLNP shows brilliant potential as next&#8208;generation delivery system in the development of mRNA vaccines with high efficacy.

         <title>Designing Ultratough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels with Centimeter&#8208;Scale Fractocohesive Lengths via Inelastic Crack Blunting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractocohesive length measures the flaw sensitivity of materials. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant the material is. Synthetic soft materials have short fractocohesive lengths, often around 1 mm. Highly flaw&#8208;insensitive single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous network of distributed chain lengths are designed, demonstrating a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels.








Abstract
Fractocohesive length, defined as the ratio of fracture toughness to work of fracture, measures the sensitivity of materials to fracture in the presence of flaws. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant and crack&#8208;resistant the hydrogel. For synthetic soft materials, the fractocohesive length is short, often on the scale of 1&#8197;mm. Here, highly flaw&#8208;insensitive (HFI) single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous polymer network of widely distributed chain lengths are designed. The HFI hydrogels demonstrate a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length of 2.21&#160;cm, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels, and an unprecedented fracture toughness of &#8776;13&#160;300 J m&#8722;2. The uncommon flaw insensitivity results from the inelastic crack blunting inherent to the highly inhomogeneous network. When the HFI hydrogel is stretched, a large number of short chains break while coiled long chains can disentangle, unwind, and straighten, producing large inelastic deformation that substantially blunts the crack tip in a plastic manner, thereby deconcentrating crack&#8208;tip stresses and blocking crack extension. The flaw&#8208;insensitive design strategy is applicable to various hydrogels such as polyacrylamide and poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels and enables the development of HFI soft composites.

         <title>Defect Passivation Refinement in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Achieving Efficiency over 45% under Low&#8208;Light and Low&#8208;Temperature Dual Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. The shift of molecular bonding upon cooling down the film leads to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability is obtained.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have emerged as the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;to&#8208;electricity technology. However, their practical application still suffers from energy loss induced by intrinsic defects within the perovskite lattice. Here, a refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. Interestingly, a shift of molecular bonding is observed upon cooling down the film, leading to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability (T90 &gt; 4000&#160;h) is obtained. The pioneer application of perovskite solar cells in above dual extreme conditions in this work reveals the key principles of designing functional groups for the passivators, and also demonstrates the capability of perovskites for diverse terrestrial energy conversion applications in demanding environments such as polar regions and outer space.

A feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs is proposed to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment. Under the catalysis of carboxylesterase, Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic ciprofloxacin derivative and chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
The presence of bacteria in tumor results in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and weakens the immune response in colorectal cancer. To overcome bacterium&#8208;induced chemotherapeutic drug resistance and potentiate antitumor immunity, herein a novel molecule Biotin&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;Cip&#8208;OH)&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;CPT)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Nap (Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap) is rationally designed containing four functional motifs (i.e., a biotin motif for targeting, Phe&#8208;Phe(&#8208;Nap) motif for self&#8208;assembly, ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) motif for antibacterial effect, and camptothecin (CPT) motif for chemotherapy). Using the designed molecule, a novel strategy of intracellular enzymatic nanofiber formation and synergistic antibacterium&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and immunotherapy is achieved. Under endocytosis mediated by highly expressed biotin receptor in colorectal cancer cell membrane and the catalysis of highly expressed carboxylesterase in the cytoplasm, this novel molecule can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic Cip&#8208;OH and chemotherapeutic drug CPT are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy towards colorectal cancer. This work offers a feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

         <title>Nanofluid&#8208;Guided Janus Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoconfined ionic liquids&#8208;guided evaporation power generator achieves high&#8208;efficiency performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and an ultra&#8208;high continuous operating time of 180 h, providing a new strategy for clean power generation technologies.








Abstract
Harvesting electricity from widespread water evaporation provides an alternative route to cleaner power generation technology. However, current evaporation power generation (EPG) mainly depends on the dissociation process of certain functional groups (e.g., SO3H) in water, which suffers from low power density and short&#8208;term output. Herein, the Janus membrane is prepared by combining nanofluid and water&#8208;grabbing material for EPG, where the nanoconfined ionic liquids (NCILs) serve as ion sources instead of the functional groups. Benefiting from the selective and fast transport of anions in NCILs, such EPG demonstrates excellent power performance with a voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and a maximum power density of 16.55 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 while operating for at least 180 h consistently. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and surface potential analysis reveal the molecular mechanism, that is, the diffusion of Cl&#8722; anions during evaporation is much faster than that of cations, generating the voltage and current across the membrane. Furthermore, the device performs well in varying environmental conditions, including different water temperatures and sources of evaporating water, showcasing its adaptability and integrability. Overall, the nanofluid&#8208;guided Janus membrane can efficiently transform low&#8208;grade thermal energy in evaporation into electricity, showing a competitive advantage over other sustainable applied approaches.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Efficiency of Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with In&#8208;Situ Interfacial Cross&#8208;Linked Modifier</title>

Moisture&#8208;assisted crosslink of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane forms a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) protective layer that not only effectively passivates perovskite surface defect, but also significantly enhances device moisture stability.








Abstract
Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is potential as the top cells in tandem configurations, owing to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs through surface treatment of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS), is reported. The silane groups in MPTS can in situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) network by Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, &#8208;SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibit superior stability when soaking in water. The optimized PSC maintains 91% of its initial efficiency after aging 1000 h in ambient atmosphere, and 86% in 800 h of operational stability testing.

         <title>Sustained and Localized Drug Depot Release Using Radiation&#8208;Activated Scintillating Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical cancer treatment often involves X&#8208;ray radiation therapy, and spatially precise radiation treatment offers the possibility of improving the therapeutic window of systemic chemotherapies designed to be activated by irradiation. This work presents scintillating nanoparticles that generate light in response to irradiation, uncaging a reservoir of sustained chemotherapy release within tumor tissue while sparing off&#8208;target sites of toxicity.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of cancer commonly incorporates X&#8208;ray radiation therapy (XRT), and developing spatially precise radiation&#8208;activatable drug delivery strategies may improve XRT efficacy while limiting off&#8208;target toxicities associated with systemically administered drugs. Nevertheless, achieving this has been challenging thus far because strategies typically rely on radical species with short lifespans, and the inherent nature of hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments may encourage spatially heterogeneous effects. It is hypothesized that the challenge could be bypassed by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit light upon X&#8208;ray absorption, locally forming therapeutic drug depots in tumor tissues. Thus a nanoparticle platform (Scintillating nanoparticle Drug Depot; SciDD) that enables the local release of cytotoxic payloads only after activation by XRT is developed, thereby limiting off&#8208;target toxicity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, SciDD is used to deliver a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing payload MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). With as little as a 2&#160;Gy local irradiation to tumors, MMAE payloads are released effectively to kill tumor cells. XRT&#8208;mediated drug release is demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models and showed efficacy over XRT alone (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001). This work shows that SciDD can act as a local drug depot with spatiotemporally controlled release of cancer therapeutics.

Orbital&#8208;interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher&#8208;order corner states and orbital&#8208;dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital&#8208;related topological physics and sound&#8208;wave interaction beyond the single&#8208;orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.








Abstract
The discovery of higher&#8208;order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed&#8208;matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics. A common way of inducing higher&#8208;order topological wave phenomena is through pseudo&#8208;spins, which mimic the electron spins as a symmetry&#8208;breaking degree of freedom. Here, this work exploits degenerate orbitals in acoustic resonant cavities to demonstrate versatile, orbital&#8208;selective, higher&#8208;order topological corner states. Type&#8208;II corner states are theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated based on tailored orbital interactions, without the need for long&#8208;range hoppings that has so far served as a key ingredient for Type&#8208;II corner states in single&#8208;orbital systems. Due to the orthogonal nature of the degenerate p orbitals, this work also introduces a universal strategy to realize orbital&#8208;dependent edge modes, featuring high&#8208;Q edge states identified in bulk bands. These findings provide an understanding of the interplay between acoustic orbitals and topology, shedding light on orbital&#8208;related topological wave physics, as well as its applications for acoustic sensing and trapping.

         <title>Reversible Optical Control of Polarization in Epitaxial Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is accomplished in epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT) thin films using UV light. For single&#8208;domain films, a transient modulation of the polarization magnitude occurs, mediated by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the Schottky interface. In PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary, room&#8208;temperature remanent optical poling is realized that can be reversed via thermal annealing.








Abstract
Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials passively, that is, non&#8208;invasively, for example, via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward active control of the polarization. In this work, optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated&#160;in prototypical epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT)&#8208;based heterostructures. This is accomplished in three steps, using above&#8208;bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, it is found that UV&#8208;light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward&#8208; or downward&#8208;oriented polarization, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, by taking advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics, remanent optical poling from a pristine multi&#8208;domain into a single&#8208;domain configuration is accomplished. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, a complete reversibility of the optical poling is further achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Reversible optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is accomplished in epitaxial PbZr&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PZT) thin films using UV light. For single-domain films, a transient modulation of the polarization magnitude occurs, mediated by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the Schottky interface. In PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary, room-temperature remanent optical poling is realized that can be reversed via thermal annealing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials &lt;i&gt;passively&lt;/i&gt;, that is, non-invasively, for example, via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt; control of the polarization. In this work, optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated&#160;in prototypical epitaxial PbZr&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PZT)-based heterostructures. This is accomplished in three steps, using above-bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, it is found that UV-light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward- or downward-oriented polarization, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, by taking advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics, remanent optical poling from a pristine multi-domain into a single-domain configuration is accomplished. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, a complete reversibility of the optical poling is further achieved. Hence, this work paves the way for the all-optical control of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric thin&#160;films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling&#8208;Mediated Sequential Drug Delivery Potentiates Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) to specifically remodel the tumor microenvironment by combining coagulation and hypoxia. Apitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3, a nanocarrier for immunotherapy, subsequently recognizes and targets tumor coagulation. Under hypoxia, IMDQ is selectively activated. This strategy boosts delivery efficacy and reduces systemic toxicity of IMDQ. It successfully eradicates 4T1 and CT26 tumors (500 mm3) without recurrence.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the de novo priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off&#8208;target toxicity. Here, this work describes a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4&#8208;NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide&#8208;decorated poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 conjugate, termed apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3). CA4&#8208;NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb&#8208;IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ is activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;&#8208;N3&#8221; to &#8220;&#8208;NH2&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirm their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8776;500 mm3 are eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.

         <title>Orbital Occupancy Modulation to Optimize Intermediate Absorption for Efficient Electrocatalysts in Water Electrolysis and Zinc&#8211;Ethanol&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the coordinating environment (coordinated atoms substitution and crystalline symmetry change) of the o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is successfully regulated to optimize its dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy. Additionally, the transformation of the ligand field caused by the reconstruction further modulates the spin configuration of the catalyst and the moderate dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy enhances the ethanol oxidiation.








Abstract
Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the metal d&#8208;orbital and the intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is prepared as pre&#8208;catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co3O4 is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites are introduced by Ni doping which enables the co&#8208;existence of four&#8208;coordinated sites and six&#8208;coordination sites in o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni. The dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy decreases after the atomic substitution, while increases after replacing the CoSe6&#8208;Oh field with CoSe6&#8208;Oh/CoSe4&#8208;Td. This work explores a new direction for the preparation of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis and innovative zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery.

Organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril as the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The 1D ion migration channel achieves the Li+ fast conduction and the noncovalent interactions facilitate the immobilization of anions, realizing Li+ uniform distribution, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries have been widely recognized as one of the candidates for the next&#8208;generation of energy storage batteries. However, the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been hindered by the lack of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high Li+ transference number, and the high stability to air. Herein, the organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#160;ion migration channels is developed as the SSE for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Taking advantage of the 1D ion migration channel for Li+ conduction, CB[7] SSE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the noncovalent interactions facilitated the immobilization of anions, realizing a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.81) and Li+ uniform distribution. The CB[7] SSE also shows a wide electrochemical stability window of 0&#8211;4.65&#160;V and high thermal stability and chemical stability, as well as realizes stable Li+ plating/stripping (more than 1000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). As a result, the CB[7] SSE endows solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (up to 500&#160;h). This design strategy of CB[7] SSE paves the way for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Van der Waals Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals (vdW) force has been regarded as a versatile and universal potential. Nevertheless, whether vdW force can be used as an attractive potential for the crystallization of colloids remains to be proven. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids can reconfigure vdW force to optimal range in terms of colloidal crystallizations.








Abstract
A general guiding principle for colloidal crystallization is to tame the attractive enthalpy such that it slightly overwhelms the repulsive interaction. As&#8208;synthesized colloids are generally designed to retain a strong repulsive potential for the high stability of suspensions, encoding appropriate attractive potentials into colloids has been key to their crystallization. Despite the myriad of interparticle attractions for colloidal crystallization, the van der Waals (vdW) force remains unexplored. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids and the resulting vdW force can reconfigure the pair potential well depth to the optimal range between &#8722;1 and &#8722;4 kBT at tens of nanometer&#8208;scale colloidal distances. As such, colloidal crystals with a distinct liquid gap can be formed, which is evidenced by photonic bandgap&#8208;based diffractive colorization.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanostructured Viologen&#8208;Siloxane Materials for Controllable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach for tunable properties of viologen&#8208;siloxane block molecules is presented, where the counterion dictates morphology, domain spacing, and conductivity. A light&#8208;responsive counterion is used to reduce the viologen in situ, enhancing its conductivity. The radical cation is stable for several days and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. Repeated pulsed&#8208;light irradiation results in a continuum of conductive states, exhibiting behavior resemblant to long&#8208;term potentiation.








Abstract
Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well&#8208;defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multistate reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials. Here, a modular and scalable approach is presented to obtain switchable phase&#8208;separated viologen&#8208;siloxane nanostructures with sub&#8208;5&#160;nm features. The domain spacing, morphology, and conductivity of these materials can be tuned by ion exchange, repeated pulsed photoirradiation and electric stimulation. Counterion exchange triggers a postsynthetic modification in domain spacing of up to 10%. Additionally, in some cases, 2D to 1D order&#8211;order transitions are observed with the latter exhibiting a sevenfold decrease in conductivity with respect to their 2D lamellar counterparts. Moreover, the combination of the viologen core with tetraphenylborate counterions enables reversible and in situ reduction upon light irradiation. This light&#8208;driven reduction provides access to a continuum of conducting states, reminiscent of long&#8208;term potentiation. The repeated voltage sweeps improve the nanostructures alignment, leading to increased conductivity in a learning effect. Overall, these results highlight the adaptivity of phase&#8208;separated nanostructures for the next generation of organic electronics, with exciting applications in smart sensors and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Ultraflexible Temperature&#8208;Strain Dual&#8208;Sensor Based on Chalcogenide Glass&#8208;Polymer Film for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is developed for fabricating ultraflexible thermoelectric films with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance, and a prototypical robotic hand for intelligent action feedback and temperature alarm is demonstrated. This work not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic thermoelectric devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing functions are highly desirable for human&#8208;machine interaction systems and wearable devices. However, current TE films still face challenges in achieving high flexibility and excellent sensing performance simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is proposed to fabricate an ultraflexible chalcogenide glass&#8208;polytetrafluoroethylene composite film with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance. The unique reticular network of the composite film endows it with efficient Seebeck effect and flexibility, leading to a high Seebeck coefficient (731 &#181;V/K), rapid temperature response (&#8776;0.7 s), and excellent strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 836). Based on this high&#8208;performance composite film, an intelligent robotic hand for action feedback and temperature alarm is fabricated, demonstrating its great potential in human&#8208;machine interaction. Such TE film fabrication strategy not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic TE devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Fast Li Replenishment Channels&#8208;Assisted Recycling of Degraded Layered Cathodes with Enhanced Cycling Performance and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiCo0.5Mn0.5BO3 (LCMB) coating bonds with the rock salt/spinel phase on degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523), forming new Li replenishment channels with a reduced diffusion energy barrier. Therefore, a very small amount of LiOH and short&#8208;time sintering are adequate for fully regeneration. The repaired LCMB&#8208;NCM523 presents high discharge specific capacity and excellent cycling performance and thermal stability.








Abstract
The direct recycling of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is important for environmental protection and resource conservation. The key regeneration processes are composition replenishment and atom rearrangement, both of which depend on the migration and diffusion of atoms. However, for the direct recycling of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (D&#8208;NCM523) cathode, the irreversible phase transitions that accumulate during the long&#8208;term cycles block the Li diffusion channels with a high diffusion energy barrier, making it difficult to fully repair the layered structure and resulting in rapid capacity decay. To address the challenge, fast Li replenishment channels are rebuilt to regulate the surface phase and effectively assist the regeneration process with a reduced energy barrier. This method reduces the amount of Li supplement by &gt;75% and shortens the sintering time (only 2&#160;h) to fully regenerate D&#8208;NCM523, compared to general direct recycling methods. The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB&#8208;NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles. In addition, LCMB&#8208;NCM523 is recycled with improved thermal decomposition peak temperature and enables 200 cycles even at 60&#160;&#176;C, greatly improving safety. This work proposes a promising way for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of layered cathodes.

         <title>Polymeric Conductive Adhesive&#8208;Based Ultrathin Epidermal Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Electrophysiological Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin conductive adhesive&#8208;based epidermal electrode with enhanced adhesion and intrinsic stretchability, optimizing conformity even during movement and ensuring prolonged sustainability, is demonstrated. A theoretical analysis is also conducted to design the electrode materials and design. By these efforts, continuous monitoring of ECG signals is conducted for 168 h (1 week) without any significant motion artifacts and signal degradation.








Abstract
Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices and epidermal electrodes. However, addressing the challenges of the electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long&#8208;term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, an ultrathin polymeric conductive adhesive,&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d&#8208;sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability, is presented. The skin conformability and stability of electrodes is designed by theoretical criteria obtained by mechanical analysis.&#160;Thus, impedance stability is obtained over 1&#8208;week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high&#8208;intensity exercise, the wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week&#8208;long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices and epidermal electrodes. However, addressing the challenges of the electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long-term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, an ultrathin polymeric conductive adhesive,&#160;poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d-sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability, is presented. The skin conformability and stability of electrodes is designed by theoretical criteria obtained by mechanical analysis.&#160;Thus, impedance stability is obtained over 1-week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high-intensity exercise, the wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week-long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers with Locally Varying Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ink composed of jammed precursor&#8208;loaded elastomeric microparticles that can be direct ink written into double network granular elastomers that can attain a wide range of stiffnesses and ultimate tensile strains is presented. Inks with different stiffnesses can be 3D printed into cm&#8208;sized structures with locally varying compositions and hence mechanical properties using commercial multinozzle 3D printers.








Abstract
Fast advances in the design of soft actuators and robots demand for new soft materials whose mechanical properties can be changed over short length scales. Elastomers can be formulated as highly stretchable or rather stiff materials and hence, are attractive for these applications. They are most frequently cast such that their composition cannot be changed over short length scales. A method that allows to locally change the composition of elastomers on hundreds of micrometer lengths scales is direct ink writing (DIW). Unfortunately, in the absence of rheomodifiers, most elastomer precursors cannot be printed through DIW. Here, 3D printable double network granular elastomers (DNGEs) whose ultimate tensile strain and stiffness can be varied over an unprecedented range are introduced. The 3D printability of these materials is leveraged to produce an elastomer finger containing rigid bones that are surrounded by a soft skin. Similarly, the rheological properties of the microparticle&#8208;based precursors are leveraged to cast elastomer slabs with locally varying stiffnesses that deform and twist in a predefined fashion. These DNGEs are foreseen to open up new avenues in the design of the next generation of smart wearables, strain sensors, prosthesis, soft actuators, and robots.

         <title>Anisotropic Morphing in Bistable Kirigami through Symmetry Breaking and Geometric Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry breaking of slit pattern in bistable kirigami metamaterials is leveraged to generate geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape deployment. The role played by symmetry groups in the nonuniform scaling of bistable kirigami metamaterials is first mapped in the entire morphing space and then harnessed as design strategy for demonstrating arbitrary scaled bistable deployment.








Abstract
Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi&#8208;rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confer isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi&#8208;analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation and Cascaded Sum Frequency Generation from a Surface Crystallized Glass Ceramic Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation (CSFG) are demonstrated in microspheres made of surface crystallized glass ceramics. Owing to random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm is demonstrated. The microspheres also boost the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of CSFG.








Abstract
The development of novel materials and structures for efficient second&#8208;order nonlinear micro/nano devices remains a significant challenge. In this study, the remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation in whispering gallery mode microspheres made of surface&#8208;crystallized glass with a 6&#8208;&#181;m Ba2TiSi2O8 crystal layer are demonstrated. Attributed to the core&#8211;shell design, the Ba2TiSi2O8 located on the surface can be efficiently coupled with whispering gallery modes, resulting in a highly efficient micron&#8208;scale cavity&#8208;enhanced second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Greatly enhanced SHG of the microcavity is observed, which is up to 80 times stronger than that of a non&#8208;resonant sample. Furthermore, owing to the wavelength non&#8208;selectivity of random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm and high&#8208;contrast polarization characteristics is demonstrated. The glass&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based microsphere cavity also boosts the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of cascaded sum frequency generation. This work delineates an efficient strategy for boosting nonlinear optical response in glass ceramics, which will open up new opportunities for applications in photonics and optical communications.

         <title>Enhanced Piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 by the Introduction of MXene and Its Utilization in Boosting High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research details a strategy to boost the piezoelectric performance of MAPbI3 by using a MXene substrate. It is demonstrated that the surface OH groups on the MXene induce a stronger polarization of the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 compared to that of the O and F groups, leading to a much more enhanced piezoelectric effect. An innovative type of flexible photodetector (PD) based on a piezoelectric MXene/MAPbI3 heterostructure is crafted, which can be enhanced simultaneously by the piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects. Utilizing MXene to boost the piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 reveals wide&#8208;range potentials for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Recently, perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are risen to prominence due to substantial research interest. Beyond merely tweaking the composition of materials, a cutting&#8208;edge advancement lies in leveraging the innate piezoelectric polarization properties of perovskites themselves. Here, the investigation shows utilizing Ti3C2Tx, a typical MXene, as an intermediate layer for significantly boosting the piezoelectric property of MAPbI3 thin films. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced polarization of the methylammonium (MA+) groups within MAPbI3, induced by the OH groups present in Ti3C2Tx. A flexible PD based on the MAPbI3/MXene heterostructure is then fabricated. The new device is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths, displays greatly enhanced performance owing to the piezo&#8208;phototronic coupling. Moreover, the device is endowed with a greatly reduced response time, down to millisecond level, through the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro&#8208;phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects can be employed to design high&#8208;performance flexible perovskite PDs.

The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro-phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo-phototronic and pyro-phototronic effects can be employed to design high-performance flexible perovskite PDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Stress and Strain Polymer Nanocomposite Actuators Incorporating a Mutually&#8208;Interpenetrated, Collective&#8208;Deformation Carbon Nanotube Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collective strategy for fabricating nanocomposites is demonstrated by incorporating a carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge into a SMP matrix. The synergistic deformation and actuation lead to extraordinary performance, including high output stress, strain, and fast response, surpassing the majority of conventional SMP&#8208;based composites and suggesting promising applications such as artificial muscles and low&#8208;temperature biomedical devices.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;based actuators are extensively studied, with the challenging goal of achieving comprehensive performance metrics that include large output stress and strain, fast response, and versatile actuation modes. The design and fabrication of nanocomposites offer a promising route to integrate the advantages of both polymers and nanoscale fillers, thus ensuring superior performance. Here, it is started from a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous sponge to fabricate a mutually interpenetrated nanocomposite, in which the embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) network undergoes collective deformation with the shape memory polymer (SMP) matrix during large&#8208;degree stretching and releasing, increases junction density with polymer chains and enhances molecular orientation. These features result in substantial improvement of the overall mechanical properties and during thermally actuated contraction, the bulk SMP/CNT composites exhibit output stresses up to 19.5 &#177; 0.97&#160;MPa and strains up to 69%, accompanied by a rapid response and high energy density, exceeding the majority of recent reports. Furthermore, electrical actuation is also demonstrated via uniform Joule heating across the self&#8208;percolated CNT network. Applications such as low&#8208;temperature thermal actuated vascular stent and wound dressing are explored. These findings lay out a universal blueprint for developing robust and highly deformable SMP/CNT nanocomposite actuators with broad potential applications.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Attention Network Based Spectral Reconstruction with Snapshot Near&#8208;Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact near&#8208;infrared (NIR) metasurface composed of 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures is proposed, and a novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the hyperspectral images. By leveraging the system, the NIR spectral images which exhibit precise textures and negligible crosstalk are precisely reconstructed.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral information is important for detecting and analyzing material compositions. However, snapshot NIR spectral imaging systems still pose significant challenges owing to the lack of high&#8208;performance NIR filters and bulky setups, preventing effective encoding and integration with mobile devices. This study introduces a snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact NIR metasurface featuring 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures. Benefitting from the sufficient spectral variety and low correlation coefficient among these structures, center&#8208;wavelength accuracy of 0.05&#160;nm and full width at half maximum accuracy of 0.13&#160;nm are realized. The system maintains good performance within an incident angle of 1&#176;. A novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction (MAN&#8208;IDR) algorithm is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality NIR spectral imaging. By leveraging the designed metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR, the NIR spectral images, exhibiting precise textures, minimal artifacts in the spatial dimension, and little crosstalk between spectral channels, are reconstructed from a single grayscale recording image. The proposed NIR metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR hold great promise for further integration with smartphones and drones, guaranteeing the adoption of NIR spectral imaging in real&#8208;world scenarios such as aerospace, health diagnostics, and machine vision.

         <title>Spatial Structure Design of Thioether&#8208;Linked Naphthoquinone Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The naphthoquinone derivative isomers with nonplanar and partially conjugated structures have been designed to guarantee high structure stability and redox unit independence, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with high achievable capacity, stable cycling performance, and ultrarapid rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have gathered extensive attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their structural diversity and molecular designability. However, the reported research mainly focuses on the design of the planar configuration of OEMs and does not take into account the important influence of the spatial structure on the electrochemical properties, which seriously hamper the further performance liberation of OEMs. Herein, this work has designed a series of thioether&#8208;linked naphthoquinone&#8208;derived isomers with tunable spatial structures and applied them as the cathodes in AZIBs. The incomplete conjugated structure of the elaborately engineered isomers can guarantee the independence of the redox reaction of active groups, which contributes to the full utilization of active sites and high redox reversibility. In addition, the position isomerization of naphthoquinones on the benzene rings changes the zincophilic activity and redox kinetics of the isomers, signifying the importance of spatial structure on the electrochemical performance. As a result, the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenedithio) bis(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) (p&#8208;PNQ) with the smallest steric hindrance and the most independent redox of active sites exhibits a high specific capacity (279 mAh g&#8722;1), an outstanding rate capability (167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and a long&#8208;term cycling lifetime (over 2800&#160;h at 0.05 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Eliminating the Burn&#8208;in Loss of Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells by Applying Dimer Acceptors as Supramolecular Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable dimer supramolecular stabilizer strategy is developed to eliminate the burn&#8208;in loss of organic solar cells (OSCs). More mechanism studies reveal that the restricted molecular diffusion, robust morphology, and low&#8208;level trap state density are keys to address the burn&#8208;in loss, resulting in a long T98 lifetime over 600 h under the maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking (MPPT) with a PCE over 19%.








Abstract
The meta&#8208;stable active layer morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs) is identified as the main cause of the rapid burn&#8208;in loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) during long&#8208;term device operation. However, effective strategies to eliminate the associated loss mechanisms from the initial stage of device operation are still lacking, especially for high&#8208;efficiency material systems. Herein, the introduction of molecularly engineered dimer acceptors with adjustable thermal transition properties into the active layer of OSCs to serve as supramolecular stabilizers for regulating the thermal transitions and optimizing the crystallization of the absorber composites is reported. By establishing intimate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with small&#8208;molecule acceptors, these stabilizers can effectively reduce the trap&#8208;state density (Nt) in the devices to achieve excellent PCEs over 19%. More importantly, the low Nt associated with an initially optimized morphology can be maintained under external stresses to significantly reduce the PCE burn&#8208;in loss in devices. This research reveals a judicious approach to improving OPV stability by establishing a comprehensive correlation between material properties, active&#8208;layer morphology, and device performance, for developing burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OSCs.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Performance in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Through Hydrogen Bond Suppression of Organic Cation Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High background carrier density in FASnI3 transistors is elucidated, originating from both Sn2+ oxidation and FA+ ion migration. The development of a hydrogen bond strategy through the integration of fluorine&#8208;substituted additives effectively suppresses cation migration, thereby reducing background carrier density and enhancing operational stability of the transistors. An impressive effective mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI3 FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn2+ but also from the migration of FA+ ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA+ and F&#8722; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine&#8208;substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn&#8208;on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with an Ion/off ratio of 107 is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin&#8208;based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Template&#8208;Assisted Mechanical Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area 2D Layers Enables Efficient and Precise Construction of Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of large&#8208;area 2D monolayers or few layers, including semiconductors, superconductors, and magnets, with high production yield are successfully exfoliated by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. Various moir&#233; superlattices, including twisted homobilayers, twisted heterobilayers, and twisted multilayer superlattices, are efficiently and precisely constructed by picking&#8208;up and stacking these 2D layers using a dry&#8208;transfer method.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, consisting of rotationally aligned 2D atomically thin layers, provide a highly novel platform for the study of correlated quantum phenomena. However, reliable and efficient construction of moir&#233; superlattices is challenging because of difficulties to accurately angle&#8208;align small exfoliated 2D layers and the need to shun wet&#8208;transfer processes. Here, efficient and precise construction of various moir&#233; superlattices is demonstrated by picking up and stacking large&#8208;area 2D mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer crystals with predetermined crystal axes, made possible by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D layers are semiconductors, superconductors, or magnets and their high quality is confirmed by photoluminescence and Raman spectra and by electrical transport measurements of fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors and Hall devices. Twisted homobilayers with angle&#8208;twisting accuracy of &#8776;0.3&#176;, twisted heterobilayers with sub&#8208;degree angle&#8208;alignment accuracy, and multilayer superlattices are precisely constructed and characterized by their moir&#233; patterns, interlayer excitons, and second harmonic generation. The present study paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena in moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Area&#8208;Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an area&#8208;selective chemical vapor deposition of gold is demonstrated. A metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 is used to create an autocatalytically active seed layer by electron beam deposition for further film growth at sub&#8208;100 &#176;C temperatures. In addition, this process provides a novel method for determining local temperature increases during electron beam writing.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high&#8208;purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre&#8208; and post&#8208;processing using a mask to produce structures. This study presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area&#8208;selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD process without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 &#176;C, over 200&#160;K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of &#8776;40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, by using the onset of the autocatalytic CVD growth, for the first time the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam can be precisely&#160;determined.

         <title>Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. This work opens opportunities to harness straintronics effects in 2DM quantum technologies.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro&#8208;mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain can completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic&#8208;angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. The data are measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low&#8208;temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6%). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and&#160;technologies.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Hindrance Engineering of A Cation toward &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskite with Minimized Tilting and High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D&#160;EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) perovskite with minimized tilting and interlayer distance is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group pushes Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The EPZPbBr4 X&#8208;ray detector exhibits specific detectivity of 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented Dion&#8211;Jacobson or Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are widely recognized as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, the large interlayer spacing significantly hinders the carrier transport. &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites naturally exhibit reduced interlayer spacings, but the tilting of metal halide octahedra is typically serious and leads to poor charge transport. Herein, a &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) with minimized tilting is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group enters the space enclosed by the three [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedra, pushing Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting as well as electron&#8211;phonon coupling. Meanwhile, the ethyl group is located between layers and contributes an extremely reduced effective interlayer distance (2.22 &#197;), further facilitating the carrier transport. As a result, EPZPbBr4 simultaneously demonstrates high &#181;&#964; product (1.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) and large resistivity (2.17 &#215; 1010 &#937; cm). The assembled X&#8208;ray detector achieves low dark current of 1.02 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2 and high sensitivity of 1240 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under the same bias voltage. The realized specific detectivity (ratio of sensitivity to noise current density, 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2) is the highest among all reported perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Femtosecond Electron Diffraction Reveals Local Disorder and Local Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and TDDFT&#8208;MD simulations, the local disorder and local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively, indicating a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel. The use of femtosecond electron diffraction is demonstrated to detect nonequilibrium structural dynamics in crystalline&#8208;disordered materials and reveal the intrinsic local disorder and local anharmonicity with femtosecond&#8208;picometer temporospatial resolution.








Abstract
In addition to long&#8208;range periodicity, local disorder, with local structures deviating from the average lattice structure, dominates the physical properties of phonons, electrons, and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials. Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such a local disorder and correlating it with advanced functions remains challenging. Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, the static local disorder and its local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively. The ultrafast structural dynamics reveal that the crystalline SnSe is composed of multiple locally correlated configurations dominated by the static off&#8208;symmetry displacements of Sn (&#8776;0.4 &#197;) and such a set of locally correlated structures is termed local disorder. Moreover, the anharmonicity of this local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs, indicating the signature of probable THz Einstein oscillators. The identified local disorder and local anharmonicity suggest a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel, which updates the fundamental insight into the long&#8208;debated ultralow thermal conductivity of SnSe. The method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the locally correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad interest in the construction of structure&#8211;property relationships in material science.

         <title>Rational Design of Multinary Metal Chalcogenide Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifetime potassium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics of anode materials for large&#8208;sized K&#8208;ion storage. In this study, a ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene composite is designed with exceptional electronic/ionic conductivity, limited volume changes, enabling high K&#8208;storage capacity, ultrafast and highly durable potassium storage.








Abstract
Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high&#8208;energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, a design featuring a layered ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb, is presented. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and structure, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/depotassiation process and demonstrates facile K+ ion transfer kinetics, enabling long&#8208;term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. In addition, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K+ migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K+. These findings provide insight in the design of durable high&#8208;energy multinary tellurides for potassium storage.

         <title>Touchless Thermosensation Enabled by Flexible Infrared Photothermoelectric Detector for Temperature Prewarning Function of Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize the touchless thermosensation function of e&#8208;skin, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is developed, based on the photothermoelectric coupling of tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate, which exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation from hot and cold stimuli. Moreover, the integration of wearable infrared detector with a soft robotic gripper for temperature prewarning is demonstrated.








Abstract
Artificial skin, endowed with the capability to perceive thermal stimuli without physical contact, will bring innovative interactive experiences into smart robotics and augmented reality. The implementation of touchless thermosensation, responding to both hot and cold stimuli, relies on the construction of a flexible infrared detector operating in the long&#8208;wavelength infrared range to capture the spontaneous thermal radiation. This imposes rigorous requirements on the photodetection performance and mechanical flexibility of the detector. Herein, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is presented, on basis of the photothermoelectric coupling of the tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and the infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate. By suppressing the optical reflection loss and aligning the destructive interference position with the absorption peak of polyimide, the fabricated thermopile detector exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation over a broad source temperature range from &#8722;50 to 110&#160;&#176;C, even capable of resolving 0.05&#160;&#176;C temperature change. Spatially resolved radiation distribution sensing is also achieved by constructing an integrated thermopile array. Furthermore, an established temperature prewarning system is demonstrated for soft robotic gripper, enabling the identification of noxious thermal stimuli in a contactless manner. A feasible strategy is offered here to integrate the infrared detection technique into the sensory modality of electronic skin.

         <title>Photoactivation Inducing Multifunctional Coupling of Fluorophore for Efficient Tumor Therapy In Situ</title>

A photoactivatable sensor for in situ formation of near infrared fluorochrome is reported. Importantly, the photoactivation process involves the generation of superoxide anion radicals, which is highly promising for photodynamic therapy. Besides, the photochemically generated product possess ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%. Importantly, BI and Cy&#9472;BI are identified as efficient CHK1 inhibitor.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules, with high&#8208;precision spatialtemporal control, have largely promoted bioimaging and phototherapy applications of fluorescent dyes. Here, the first photoactivatable sensor (BI) is described that can be triggered by broad excitation light (405&#8211;660 nm), which further undergoes intersystem crossing and H&#8208;atom transfer processes to forming superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and carbon radicals. Particularly, the photoinduced gain of carbon&#8208;centered radicals (BI&#8226;) allows for radical&#8208;radical coupling to afford the combined crosslink product (BI&#9472;BI), which would be oxidized in the presence of O2&#8722;&#8226; to produce an extended conjugate system with near infrared emission (820 nm). Besides, the photochemically generated product (Cy&#9472;BI) possesses ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%, which optimized phototherapy potential. What&#8242;s more, Western Blot assay reveals that both BI and the photoproduct Cy&#9472;BI can efficiently inhibit the expression of CHK1, and the irradiation of BI and Cy&#9472;BI further induces apoptosis and ultimately enhances the phototherapeutic effects. Thus, the combination of cell cycle block inducing apoptosis, photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy treatments significantly suppress solid tumor in vivo antitumor efficacy explorations. This is a novel finding in developing photoactivatable molecules, as well as the broad applicability of photoimaging and phototherapy in tumor&#8208;related areas.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Interfacial Confined Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots Quasisuperlattice Microcavities for High&#8208;Resolution Full&#8208;Color Microlaser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly method is developed for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of quasisuperlattice CQD microstructure arrays by controlling dewetting dynamics. CQD microring arrays exhibit high&#8208;Q laser resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable laser emission modes. Surface treatment and liquid dynamics control enable on&#8208;chip integration of multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are considered a promising material for the next generation of integrated display devices due to their designable optical bandgap and low energy consumption. Owing to their dispersibility in solvents, CQD micro/nanostructures are generally fabricated by solution&#8208;processing methods. However, the random mass transfer in liquid restricts the programmable construction in macroscopy and ordered assembly in microscopy for the integration of CQD optical structures. Herein, a multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly strategy is developed to fabricate CQDs programmable microstructure arrays with a quasisuperlattice configuration through controlling the dynamics of three&#8208;phase contact lines (TPCLs). The motion of TPCLs dominates the division of liquid film for precise positioning of CQD microstructures, while pinned TPCLs control the solvent evaporation and concentration gradient to directionally drive the mass transfer and packing of CQDs. Owing to their long&#8208;range order and adjustable structural dimensions, CQD microring arrays function as high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor (high&#8208;Q) lasing resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable lasing emission modes. Through the further surface treatment and liquid dynamics control, the on&#8208;chip integration of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays are demonstrated. The technique establishes a new route to fabricate large&#8208;area, ultrahigh&#8208;definition, and full&#8208;color CQD laser displays.

         <title>Insight into Multiple Intermolecular Coordination of Composite Solid Electrolytes via Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a simple and effective composite solid electrolyte with multiple coordination to stabilize high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries is discovered, and the interface formation mechanism is visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The multiple coordination prevents the continuous decomposition of the polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites and establishing stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through the preferential decomposition of anions, thereby ensuring the long&#8208;term cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Polymer/ceramic&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSE) are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SLBs), benefiting from the combined mechanical robustness of polymeric electrolytes and the high ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes. However, the interfacial instability and poorly understood interphases of CSE hinder their application in high&#8208;voltage SLBs. Herein, a simple but effective CSE that stabilizes high&#8208;voltage SLBs by forming multiple intermolecular coordination interactions between polyester and ceramic electrolytes is discovered. The multiple coordination between the carbonyl groups in poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and the fluorosulfonyl groups in anions with Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 nanoparticles is directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation. Importantly, the multiple coordination in CSE not only prevents the continuous decomposition of polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites but also establishes stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through preferential decomposition of anions. The stable CSE and its inorganic&#8208;rich interphases enable Li||Li symmetric cells with an exceptional lifespan of over 4800 h without dendritic shorting at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high&#8208;voltage SLB with LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode displays excellent cycling stability over 1100 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. This work reveals the underlying mechanism behind the excellent stability of coordinating composite electrolytes and interfaces in high&#8208;voltage SLBs.

         <dc:description>
A conceptually new, coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by integrating acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction is developed, leading to a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.057&#160;V. More specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode demonstrates a high electricity output and excellent durability, far superior to the conventional fuel cells.








Abstract
Conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells suffer from the low output voltage, insufficient durability, and high&#8208;cost catalysts (e.g., noble metals). Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly&#8208;developed CF&#8208;FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81&#160;V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110&#160;h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, &lt; 1.0&#160;V, &lt; 50% retention over 20&#160;h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF&#8208;FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel&#8208;series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Thus, this study provides a platform to transform conventional fuel cell technology through the rational design and development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices by coupling different electrocatalytic reactions.

The co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit markedly improved stability and facilitate prolonged, sustained drug release following minimally invasive subconjunctival administration, so as to successfully mitigate the progression of age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) by harnessing a synergistic combination of anti&#8208;angiogenesis, anti&#8208;oxidative stress, anti&#8208;fibrosis and anti&#8208;inflammation actions.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) disease has become a worldwide senile disease, and frequent intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) is the mainstream treatment in the clinic, which is associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. Herein, nintedanib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, and lutein, a potent antioxidant, can co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles through multiple noncovalent interactions. Interestingly, the co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit significantly improved stability and achieve long&#8208;term sustained release of two drugs for at least two months in mice. Interestingly, in rabbit eyeball with a more complete barrier system, the L/N NPs still successfully distribute in the retina and choroid for a month. In the laser&#8208;induced mouse choroidal neovascularization model, the L/N NPs after a minimally invasive subconjunctival administration can successfully inhibit angiogenesis and achieve comparable and even better therapeutic results to that of standard intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;VEGF. Therefore, the subconjunctival injection of L/N NPs with long&#8208;term sustained drug release behavior represents a promising and innovative strategy for AMD treatment. Such minimally invasive administration together with the ability to effectively inhibit angiogenesis reduce inflammation and counteract oxidative stress and holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from this debilitating eye condition.

         <title>PROTAC Prodrug&#8208;Integrated Nanosensitizer for Potentiating Radiation Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;loaded nanosensitizer, featuring PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) prodrug and HfO2 nanoparticles, is engineered to sensitize radiotherapy in head and neck cancer by amplifying DNA damage and inactivating RAD51&#8208;associated protein 1 through bromodomain protein 4 degradation. 








Abstract
Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary options for clinical cancer therapy, in particular advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, the crucial role of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4)&#8208;RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) axis in sensitizing RT of HNSCC is revealed. A versatile nanosensitizer (RPB7H) is thus innovatively engineered by integrating a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) prodrug (BPA771) and hafnium dioxide (HfO2) nanoparticles to downregulate BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 pathway and sensitize HNSCC tumor to RT. Upon intravenous administration, the RPB7H nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor tissue and internalize into tumor cells by recognizing neuropilin&#8208;1 overexpressed in the tumor mass. HfO2 nanoparticles enhance RT effectiveness by amplifying X&#8208;ray deposition, intensifying DNA damage, and boosting oxidative stress. Meanwhile, BPA771 can be activated by RT&#8208;induced H2O2 secretion to degrade BRD4 and inactivate RAD51AP1, thus impeding RT&#8208;induced DNA damage repair. This versatile nanosensitizer, combined with X&#8208;ray irradiation, effectively regresses HNSCC tumor growth in a mouse model. The findings introduce a PROTAC prodrug&#8208;based radiosensitization strategy by targeting the BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 axis, may offer a promising avenue to augment RT and more effective HNSCC therapy.

         <title>Gradiently Foaming Ultrasoft Hydrogel with Stop Holes for Highly Deformable, Crack&#8208;Resistant and Sensitive Conformal Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the challenges of simultaneously achieving ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness, and high sensitivity for wearable sensing applications, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels with stop holes as ultrasoft, high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance, and sensitive conformal HMIs for remote disease diagnosis and smart aquaculture.








Abstract
Hydrogels are considered as promising materials for human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs) owing to their merits of tailorable mechanical and electrical properties; nevertheless, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness and high sensitivity, which are the pre&#8208;requisite requirements for wearable sensing applications. Herein, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate ultrasoft gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels (FSHs) with stop holes for high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance and sensitive conformal HMIs. As a typical system, the FSH based on polyacrylamide/sodium alginate system shows an ultralow Young's modulus (1.68&#160;kPa), increased sustainable strain (1411%), enhanced fracture toughness (915.6 J&#160;m&#8722;2), improved tensile sensitivity (21.77), and compressive sensitivity (65.23 kPa&#8722;1). The FSHs are used for precisely acquiring and identifying gesture commands of the operator to remotely control a surgical robot for endoscopy and an electric ship in a first&#8208;person perspective for cruising, feeding crabs and monitoring the environmental change in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Viscoelasticity&#8208;Controlled Relaxation in Wrinkling Surface for Multistage Time&#8208;Resolved Optical Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; wrinkling system with controllable polymer interaction networks. By regulating the viscoelasticity of polymer interaction networks, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. Consequently, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved, which can be further utilized to develop a practical encryption label.








Abstract
As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity&#8208;controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time&#8208;resolved encryption materials in utilization potential. Besides, the dynamic hydrogen bond networks are extended to various dynamic interaction networks, demonstrating the versatility of the dynamic encryption strategy. This work not only provides an additional dimension for dynamic information encryption in daily practical use, but also offers theoretical guidance for the development of advanced optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and smart display materials in the future.

         <title>Dynamically Reconstructed Triple&#8208;Copper&#8208;Vacancy Associates Confined in Cu Nanowires Enabling High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates are first constructed through electroreduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations disclose the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which favor *CO adsorption and dimerization.








Abstract
Electrochemically reconstructed Cu&#8208;based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO2&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ reactivity. Herein, Cu vacancies are first constructed through electrochemical reduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, in which high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations unravel the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV.

&lt;p&gt;Triple-copper-vacancy associates are first constructed through electroreduction of Cu-based nanowires, demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy image. In situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density-functional-theory calculations disclose the triple-copper-vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which favor *CO adsorption and dimerization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically reconstructed Cu-based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; reactivity. Herein, Cu vacancies are first constructed through electrochemical reduction of Cu-based nanowires, in which high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple-copper-vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple-copper-vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density-functional-theory calculations unravel the triple-copper-vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the triple-copper-vacancy associates confined in Cu nanowires achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of over 80% for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products in a wide current density range of 400&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming most reported Cu-based electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Electron Migration Polarization Boosting Electromagnetic Wave Absorption Based on Ce Atoms Modulated yolk@shell FexN@NGC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs system is constructed to demonstrate the electron migration mechanism, where the Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) with +3 valence state can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles through conductive network under EMW. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance.








Abstract
The electron migration polarization is considered as a promising approach to optimize electromagnetic waves (EMW) dissipation. However, it is still difficult to realize well&#8208;controlled electron migration and elucidate the related EMW loss mechanisms for current researches. Herein, a novel FexN@NGC/Ce system to construct an effective electron migration model based on the electron leaps among the 4f/5d/6s orbitals of Ce ions is explored. In Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs, Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) mainly represent a +3 valence state, which can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a conductive network under EMW, leading to the electron migration polarization. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance with a minimum reflection loss exceeds &#8722;85.1&#160;dB and a broadened absorption bandwidth up to 7.5&#160;GHz at 1.5&#160;mm. This study clarifies the in&#8208;depth relationship between electron migration polarization and EMW dissipation, providing profound insights into developing well&#8208;coordinated magnetic&#8211;dielectric nanocomposites for EMW absorption engineering.

         <title>High&#8208;Safety Electrolytes with an Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structure Tuned by Difluorinated Cations for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel medium concentration electrolyte is designed based on the gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid with ultrahigh safety, high voltage stability, high temperature stability, and excellent Ni&#8208;rich cathode compatibility.








Abstract
As next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high&#8208;voltage resistance, and a long life span. Electrolyte engineering is a facile strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs. In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle&#8208;concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultrahigh safety, high&#8208;voltage stability, and excellent ternary&#8208;cathode compatibility. Novel gem&#8208;difluorinated cations first synthesized for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anion&#8211;solvent and ionic liquid (IL) cation&#8211;solvent pairs are first revealed, which are beneficial for promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process. Benefiting from the unique anion&#8208;rich solvation structure, a stable hetero&#8208;SEI structure is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high&#8208;voltage ternary cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.

         <title>Gradient Pores Enhance Charge Storage Density of Carbonaceous Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge density of Zn&#8208;ion capacitor (ZIC)&#160;is significantly enhanced by deploying an activated meso&#8208;microporous shell&#160;carbon (MMSC&#8208;A) nanofibers. The tailored pore size and gradient&#8208;pore structure endow the nanofibers with unusual charge storage mechanism, as elucidated by multiple in situ means.








Abstract
Engineering carbonaceous cathode materials with adequately accessible active sites is crucial for unleashing their charge storage potential. Herein, activated meso&#8208;microporous shell carbon (MMSC&#8208;A)&#160;nanofibers are constructed to enhance the zinc ion storage density by forming a gradient&#8208;pore structure. A dominating pore size of 0.86&#160;nm is tailored to cater for the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+. Moreover, these gradient porous nanofibers feature rapid ion/electron dual conduction pathways and offer abundant active surfaces with high affinity to electrolyte. When employed in Zn&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs), the electrode delivers significantly enhanced capacity (257 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 78&#160;W kg&#8722;1), and cyclic stability (95% retention after 10&#160;000 cycles) compared to nonactivated carbon nanofibers electrode. A series of in situ characterization techniques unveil that the improved Zn2+ storage capability stems from size compatibility between the pores and [Zn(H2O)6]2+, the co&#8208;adsorption of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722;, as well as reversible surface chemical interaction. This work presents an effective method to engineering meso&#8208;microporous carbon materials toward high energy&#8208;density storage, and also offers insights into the Zn2+ storage mechanism in such gradient&#8208;pore structures.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvating Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolyte is developed to enhance the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promote more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+. This new type of ionic liquid electrolyte improves Li+ transport ability and stabilizes the interface between the electrolyte and high&#8208;nickel cathode, rendering the practical application toward high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li+ transport due to increased ions&#8217; clustering caused by Coulombic interactions.

&lt;p&gt;An anion-reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolyte is developed to enhance the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promote more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This new type of ionic liquid electrolyte improves Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport ability and stabilizes the interface between the electrolyte and high-nickel cathode, rendering the practical application toward high-safety and high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high-safety and high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport due to increased ions&#8217; clustering caused by Coulombic interactions. Here a type of anion-reinforced solvating ILEs (ASILEs) is discovered, which reduce ions&#8217; clustering by enhancing the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promoting more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to address this concern. The designed ASILEs, incorporating chlorinated hydrocarbons and two anions, bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), aim to enhance Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport ability, stabilize the interface of the high-nickel cathode material (LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NCM811), and retain fire-retardant properties. With these ASILEs, the Li/NCM811 cell exhibits high initial specific capacity (203 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C), outstanding capacity retention (81.6% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C), and excellent average Coulombic efficiency (99.9% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). Furthermore, an Ah-level Li/NCM811 pouch cell achieves a notable energy density of 386&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating the practical feasibility of this electrolyte.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete hardware&#8208;based and secure user authentication scheme using public key cryptography with integrated circuits constructed using monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is demonstrated. A key highlight of this study involves exploiting the unique properties of homomorphic encryption where computations are performed on the encrypted data while preserving the integrity of the underlying information.








Abstract
User authentication is a critical aspect of any information exchange system&#160;which verifies the identities of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this approachrelies on establishing robust digital signature protocols&#160;which employ asymmetric encryption techniques involving a key pair consisting of a public key and its matching private key. In this article, a user verification platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is presented. First, generation of secure cryptographic keys is demonstrated by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites. Subsequently, the ability to manipulate the functionality of logical NOR is leveraged to create a secure one&#8208;way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct digital signatures. These signatures when subsequently decrypted, verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, the advantages of implementing a NOR&#8208;based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR&#8208;based encryption method are established. This demonstration highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;based ICs in developing critical hardware information security primitives.

         <title>Strain Regulation of Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites Enables High&#8208;Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rb+ fills the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the MA volatilization, relieving shrinkage strain of perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion increases the halide migration barrier, resulting a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase, and suppressing nonradiative recombination. As a result, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap mixed&#8208;halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, it is shown that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride&#8208;assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low Voc. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high Voc of 1.22&#160;V. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun illumination conditions.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Interphase with Energy Dissipation and Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Capacity Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [an]daisy chain (DC)&#8208;based mechanically interlocked network (DCMIN) is used as the artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) for stabilizing the lithium metal anode. The synergistic contractile and large&#8208;amplitude molecular motion of the [an]DC enable the DCMIN not only an effective energy dissipation function but also a fast Li&#8208;ion transport behavior, thus realizing a stable 2800&#160;h of Li&#8208;symmetrical cycling.








Abstract
Constructing an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) on Li metal anodes (LMAs) is a potential strategy for addressing the dendrite issues. However, the mechanical fatigue of the ASEI caused by stress accumulation under the repeated deformation from the Li plating/stripping is not taken seriously. Herein, this work introduces a mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) into the ASEI to stabilize the Li metal/ASEI interface by combining the functions of energy dissipation and fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The DCMIN featured by large&#8208;range molecular motions is cross&#8208;linked via efficient thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry; thus, the DCMIN has flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. As an ASEI, the crown ether units in DCMIN not only interact with the dialkylammonium of a flexible chain, forming the energy dissipation behavior but also coordinate with Li ion to support the fast Li&#8208;ion transport in DCMIN. Therefore, a stable 2800&#160;h&#8208;symmetrical cycling (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and an excellent 5 C&#8208;rate (full cell with LiFePO4) performance are achieved by DCMIN&#8208;based ASEI. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell (LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2 cathode) with DCMIN&#8208;coated LMA exhibits improved capacity retention (88%) relative to the Control. The molecular design of DCMIN provides new insights into the optimization of an ASEI for high&#8208;energy LMAs.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Induced Amorphization of Cobalt&#8208;Based Catalyst for Boosted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide with optimized band structure and catalytic energetics is&#160;theoretically proposed and successfully prepared in an amorphous state. The Se,O co&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets are capable of photocatalyzing CO2 to CO with satisfactory activity and selectivity, superior to other Co&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to energy carriers is intriguing in the industry but kinetically hard to fulfil due to the lack of rationally designed catalysts. A promising way to improve the efficiency and selectivity of such reduction is to break the structural symmetry of catalysts by manipulating coordination. Here, inspired by analogous CoO6 and CoSe6 octahedral structural motifs of the Co(OH)2 and CoSe, a hetero&#8208;anionic coordination strategy is proposed to construct a symmetry&#8208;breaking photocatalyst prototype of oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide upon first&#8208;principles calculations. Such involvement of large&#8208;size Se atoms in CoO6 octahedral frameworks experimentally lead to the switching of semiconductor type of cobalt hydroxide from p to n, generation of oxygen defects, and amorphization. The resultant oxygen&#8208;deficient Se,O&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets exhibit impressive photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO with a generation rate of 60.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of photosensitizer and scavenger, superior to most of the Co&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work establishes a correlation between the symmetry&#8208;breaking of catalytic sites and CO2 photoreduction performances, opening up a new paradigm in the design of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-deficient Se-doped cobalt hydroxide with optimized band structure and catalytic energetics is&#160;theoretically proposed and successfully prepared in an amorphous state. The Se,O co-coordinated Co-based amorphous nanosheets are capable of photocatalyzing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with satisfactory activity and selectivity, superior to other Co-based catalysts.

         <title>Printable Block Molecular Assemblies with Controlled Exciton Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of molecular heterostructure is successfully fabricated, with precise control over exciton dynamics in each block (including singlet and triplet excitons featuring ns, &#181;s, and ms emission lifetimes). Moreover, these heterostructures are printable and can be accurately positioned using a Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, leading to programable patterns.








Abstract
Creating hierarchical molecular block heterostructures, with the control over size, shape, optical, and electronic properties of each nanostructured building block can help develop functional applications, such as information storage, nanowire spectrometry, and photonic computing. However, achieving precise control over the position of molecular assemblies, and the dynamics of excitons in each block, remains a challenge. In the present work, the first fabrication of molecular heterostructures with the control of exciton dynamics in each block, is demonstrated. Additionally, these heterostructures are printable and can be precisely positioned using Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, resulting in programable patterns. Singlet excitons with emission lifetimes on nanosecond or microsecond timescales and triplet excitons with emission lifetimes on millisecond timescales appear simultaneously in different building blocks, with an efficient energy transfer process in the heterojunction. These organic materials also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive emission by changing the power or wavelength of the excitation laser. Potential applications of these organic heterostructures in integrated photonics, where the versatility of fluorescence, phosphorescence, efficient energy transfer, printability, and stimulus sensitivity co&#8208;exist in a single nanowire, are foreseen.

         <title>Customized Enhancement of Thermal Sensitivity of Tumors at Different Subcutaneous Depths by Multichannel Lanthanide Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated hydrophilic multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobe, the depth of a tumor can be evaluated through fluorescence imaging. The probe enables tunable release of a heat shock protein inhibitor to enhance thermal sensitivity of tumors for customized photothermal therapy. An optimized nonuniform light field enables efficient ablation of tumors at different subcutaneous depths while minimizing injury to surrounding tissues.








Abstract
The photothermal therapeutic effect on tumors located at different subcutaneous depths varies due to the attenuation of light by tissue. Here, based on the wavelength&#8208;dependent optical attenuation properties of tissues, the tumor depth is assessed using a multichannel lanthanide nanocomposite. A zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;coated nanocomposite is able to deliver high amounts of the hydrophilic heat shock protein 90 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network formed by the encapsulated highly polarized polyoxometalate guest. It is superior to both bare and PEGylated ZIF&#8208;8 for drug delivery. With the assessment of tumor depth and accumulated amount of nanocomposite by fluorescence, an irradiation prescription can be customized to release sufficient HSP90 inhibitor and generate heat for sensitized photothermal treatment of tumors, which not only ensured therapeutic efficacy but also minimized damage to the surrounding tissues.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering of Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Single Atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 Electrocatalyst for PET Upcycling at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading is designed for the highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen. This process allows the valuable chemicals production at the ampere&#8208;level current density with high efficiency and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET).








Abstract
The plastic waste issue has posed a series of formidable challenges for the ecological environment and human health. While conventional recycling strategies often lead to plastic down&#8208;cycling, the electrochemical strategy of recovering valuable monomers enables an ideal, circular plastic economy. Here a corrosion synthesized single atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading for highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen is reported. Electro&#8208;oxidation of PET hydrolysate, ethylene glycol (EG), to formate is processed with high Faraday efficiency (FE) and selectivity (&gt;90%) at the current density close to 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1.444&#160;V vs RHE). The in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the mechanism and the understanding of the high efficiency. Remarkably, the electro&#8208;oxidation of EG at the ampere&#8208;level current density is also successfully illustrated by using a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly with high FEs to formate integrated with hydrogen production for 500&#160;h of continuous operation. This process allows valuable chemical production at high space&#8208;time yield and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET), showing an industrial perspective on single&#8208;atom catalysis of electrochemical plastic upcycling.

         <title>Reversible Mechanical Contraception and Endometriosis Treatment Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implant for reversible fallopian tube occlusion, offering an alternative to permanent sterilization and endometriosis treatment, is introduced. These hydrogel implants mechanically block the tubes with high effectiveness and are removable within 30 min using UV light or a glutathione solution. Demonstrating in ex vivo and in vivo models, this multifunctional system provides a potential method for on&#8208;demand contraception and a mechanical approach to prevent and treat abdominal endometriosis.








Abstract
Female sterilization via fallopian tube ligation is a common procedure; However, after the operation, over 10% of women seek re&#8208;fertilization, which is frequently unsuccessful. In addition, there is evidence that fallopian tubes contribute to the spread of endometriotic tissue as they serve as channels for proinflammatory media entering the abdominal cavity via retrograde menstruation. Here, stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implants are presented for the functional, biocompatible, and reversible occlusion of fallopian tubes. The hydrogel implants, designed with customized swelling properties, mechanically occlude fallopian tubes in a high&#8208;performance manner with burst pressures reaching 255&#8211;558&#160;mmHg, exceeding normal abdominal pressures (95&#160;mmHg). Their damage&#8208;free removal can be achieved within 30 min using near&#8208;visible UV light or a glutathione solution, employing a method akin to standard fallopian tube perfusion diagnostics. Ultrasound&#8208;guided implant placement is demonstrated using a clinical hysteroscope in a human&#8208;scale uterus model and biocompatibility in a porcine in vivo model. Importantly, the prevention of live sperm as well as endometrial cell passage through blocked fallopian tubes is demonstrated. Overall, a multifunctional system is presented that constitutes a possible means of on&#8208;demand, reversible contraception along with the first&#8208;ever mechanical approach to abdominal endometriosis prevention and treatment.

Ultrasound-guided implant placement is demonstrated using a clinical hysteroscope in a human-scale uterus model and biocompatibility in a porcine in vivo model. Importantly, the prevention of live sperm as well as endometrial cell passage through blocked fallopian tubes is demonstrated. Overall, a multifunctional system is presented that constitutes a possible means of on-demand, reversible contraception along with the first-ever mechanical approach to abdominal endometriosis prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Secondary Amines Functionalized Organocatalytic Iodine Redox for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalytic mechanism of secondary amine functionalized phenylamine&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymer (PA&#8208;CMP) cathode on iodine redox through H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bridging is systematically investigated. The I&#8722; anion based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance with ultrahigh capacity of 730/516 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, ultralow overpotential of 47/129 mV at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, and stable long&#8208;term performance for over 5000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) based on the cooperative redox of cations and iodine anions at the anode and cathode respectively, are attracting increasing interest because of high capacity and safety. However, the full&#8208;cell performance is limited by the sluggish iodine redox kinetics between iodide and polyiodide involving multiple electron transfer steps, and the undesirable shuttling effect of polyiodides. Here, this work reports a versatile conjugated microporous polymer functionalized with secondary amine groups as an organocatalytic cathode for ADIB, which can be positively charged and electrostatically adsorb iodide, and organocatalyze iodine redox reactions through the amine groups. Both theoretical calculations and controlled experiments confirm that the secondary amine groups confine (poly)iodide species via hydrogen bonding, which is essential for accelerating iodine redox kinetics and reducing the polyiodide shuttling effect. The ADIB achieves an ultrahigh capacity of 730 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ultrasmall overpotential of 47&#160;mV at 1 A g&#8722;1, which also exhibits excellent rate performance and long cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8201;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the promise of developing organocatalysts for accelerating electrochemical processes, which remains a virtually unexplored area in electrocatalyst design for clean energy applications.

         <title>RhNi Bimetallenes with Lattice&#8208;Compressed Rh Skin towards Ultrastable Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
RhNi bimetallenes with a Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability for over 400 h towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction, which also reveals an excellent catalytic performance, including a high NH3 yield (13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and a commendable NH3 Faradaic efficiency (98.4%).








Abstract
Harvesting recyclable ammonia (NH3) from acidic nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;containing wastewater requires the utilization of corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalytic materials with high activity and selectivity towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3ER). Herein, ultrathin RhNi bimetallenes with Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) are fabricated towards acidic NO3ER. The Rh&#8208;skin atoms on the surface of RhNi@Rh BMLs experience the lattice compression&#8208;induced strain effect, resulting in shortened Rh&#8211;Rh bond and downshifted d&#8208;band center. Experimental and theoretical calculation results corroborate that Rh&#8208;skin atoms can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability of RhNi@Rh BMLs (over 400 h) towards acidic NO3ER. RhNi@Rh BMLs also reveal an excellent catalytic performance, boasting a 98.4% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and a 13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 NH3 yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in NO3ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid zinc&#8208;nitrate battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density. This work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high&#8208;efficiency corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and environment.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Intrinsic High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric 2D CuCrSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 single crystal. The ultrathin CuCrSe2 nanosheet exhibits a high Curie temperature TC of 800 K. The in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in 2D CuCrSe2 are characterized by piezo&#8208;response force microscopy measurements and confirmed by the lateral and vertical devices.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature are critical for multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization is consistently broken by the strong thermal fluctuations at high temperature, resulting in the rare discovery of high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity in 2D materials. Here, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets. The crystal structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization. The measured ferroelectric phase transition temperature of ultrathin CuCrSe2 is about &#8776;800 K. Significantly, the switchable ferroelectric polarization is observed in &#8776;5.2&#160;nm nanosheet. Moreover, the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric response are modulated by different maximum bias voltage. This work provides a new insight into the construction of 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.

         <title>Homeostatic Solid Solution Reaction in Phosphate Cathode: Breaking High&#8208;Voltage Barrier to Achieve High Energy Density and Long Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homeostatic solid solution characteristics drive the phosphate with multilevel redox (MLNP) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), breaking through the high barrier of intrinsic mono&#8208;redox center with sluggish reactivity&#160;by differentiating each redox couple. This establishes fast and stable reaction kinetics, balancing multi&#8208;electron transfer and low strain to develope high energy&#8208;density and durable NASICON cathodes for SIBs.








Abstract
The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium&#8208;based polyanions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard&#8208;to&#8208;access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron&#8208;transfer process (&#8776;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance cathodes in SIBs.

And the electron transfer between V&lt;sup&gt;3+/4+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V&lt;sup&gt;4+/5+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple is still in hard-to-access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V&lt;sup&gt;4+/5+&lt;/sup&gt; at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron-transfer process (&#8776;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high-performance cathodes in SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple&#8208;Structured Acceptor with Highly Interconnected Electron&#8208;Transport Pathway Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport plays a significant role in determining the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a highly interconnected electron&#8208;transport pathway in simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) is achieved by manipulating the alkyl&#8208;chain topology. Therefore, the 3TTB&#8208;4F with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certified 16.59%), establishing it as the highest efficiency among NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
Achieving desirable charge&#8208;transport highway is of vital importance for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, it is shown how molecular packing arrangements can be regulated via tuning the alkyl&#8208;chain topology, thus resulting in a 3D network stacking and highly interconnected pathway for electron transport in a simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains. As a result, a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA&#8208;based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

Hardware Security
In article number 2400661, Akshay Wali, Harikrishnan Ravichandran, and Saptarshi Das present a novel hardware security authentication system that employs programmable integrated circuits (ICs) crafted from atomically thin monolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a two&#8208;dimensional material. It capitalizes on the inherent randomness of charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping in 2D memtransistors to generate cryptographic keys. Additionally, it utilizes the properties of a NOR gate to establish a secure one&#8208;way hash function.

Immunotherapy
The image demonstrates the ionic liquid embolic exiting the tip of a catheter and filling the arteries of the tumor. The purple color depicts the ablation of the vessel wall and the adjacent tumor tissue as the ionic liquid diffuses across the vessel wall. As the ionic liquid diffuses trans&#8208;arterially, it carries its payload, which in this case is Nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. Along the margins of the tumor ablation, Nivolumab is seen interacting with cells enabling immunotherapy to occur. More details can be found in article number 2309412 by Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers.

Radiotherapy Adjuvant
In article number 2311291, Yuliang Zhao, Zhihua Liu, Chunying Chen, and co&#8208;workers report that a novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment responsiveness is developed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.

Reversible hydrogel implants for fallopian tube occlusion offer a potential solution for both reversible contraception and mechanical prevention of endometriosis. The soft hydrogel implant effectively blocks fallopian tubes, prevents sperm and endometrial cell crossing, and can be safely removed on demand by hysteroscopic light application. More details can be found in article number 2310301 by Alexandre H.C. Anthis, Inge K. Herrmann, and co&#8208;workers.

Van Der Waals Colloidal Crystals
In article number 2312748, Seungwoo Lee and co&#8208;workers report a method for the unexplored van der Waals force&#8208;driven colloidal crystallization. This study demonstrates how to modulate their inter&#8208;particle interaction, enabling the colloidal crystallization with liquid gap. The diffractive colors of the colloidal crystals have been visualized through optical microscopy, correlate with their SEM image.

3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers
The frontispiece showcases a granular ink composed of elastomeric microparticles that is 3D printed through direct ink writing (DIW) into the iconic Matterhorn, the Swiss mountain landmark. In article number 2313189, Eva Baur, Benjamin Tiberghien, and Esther Amstad solidify the granular structure without compromising the shape fidelity of the printed object by forming a 2nd percolating elastomer network across the microparticles to result in double network granular elastomers (DNGEs).

Artificial Lymph Node
In article number 2310043, Hai&#8208;Quan Mao, Jonathan P. Schneck, and co&#8208;workers report an artificial lymph node (aLN) biomatrix composed of a hydrogel conjugated with T cell stimulating signals. Following subcutaneous injection, this aLN biomatrix develops into a complex immune niche in vivo. Na&#239;ve, adoptively transferred T cells are stimulated within the aLN in an antigen&#8208;specific manner through direct interaction with the matrix. The cover art depicts a novel aLN hydrogel biomatrix which when injected subcutaneously, is capable of simulating adoptively transferred na&#239;ve T cells and recruiting an array of endogenous immune cells. Upon entering the porous biomatrix, na&#239;ve T cells (green) bind to the antigen&#8208;specific stimulating signals conjugated to the hydrogel matrix and are activated (yellow) and interact with the recruited cells in the dynamic immune microenvironment, which facilitate the expansion and differentiation into effector and memory T&#8208;cells (orange). The activated T cells then emigrate and travel to the tumor where they can directly kill the tumor cells and lead to increased survival of animals with established tumors.

         <title>Structuring and Shaping of Mechanically Robust and Functional Hydrogels toward Wearable and Implantable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable similarities to living tissues make hydrogels especially suitable for biointegrated applications that closely interact with human bodies. Recent progress in polymer science and advanced processing technologies that enable the mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels are reviewed. Moreover, perspectives on further development of mechanically reliable, adaptive biointegrated hydrogel devices for practical use are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man&#8208;made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.

         <title>Roadmap for Clinical Translation of Mobile Microrobotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical use of medical microrobots gets closer to reality with the rapidly growing biomedical research on them. However, the clinical translation of microrobots has several challenges and obstacles, including scalability, biocompatibility, and imaging. In this review article, a realistic roadmap for medical microrobots is conceptualized with the collaborative efforts of microrobot researchers and&#160;clinicians.








Abstract
Medical microrobotics is an emerging field to revolutionize clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics of various diseases. On the other hand, the mobile microrobotics field has important obstacles to pass before clinical translation. This article focuses on these challenges and provides a roadmap of medical microrobots to enable their clinical use. From the concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; to the physicochemical interactions of microrobots in complex biological environments in medical applications, there are several translational steps to consider. Clinical translation of mobile microrobots is only possible with a close collaboration between clinical experts and microrobotics researchers to address the technical challenges in microfabrication, safety, and imaging. The clinical application potential can be materialized by designing microrobots that can solve the current main challenges, such as actuation limitations, material stability, and imaging constraints. The strengths and weaknesses of the current progress in the microrobotics field are discussed and a roadmap for their clinical applications in the near future is&#160;outlined.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk sericin, as an advanced biomedical material, exhibits well cytocompatibility, low immunogenicity, cell function&#8208;regulating activities, etc. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances and biomedical applications of this natural sericin bioactive material and discusses unsolved issues, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
Sericin, a protein derived from silkworm cocoons, is considered a waste product derived from the silk industry for thousands of years due to a lack of understanding of its properties. However, in recent decades, a range of exciting properties of sericin are studied and uncovered, including cytocompatibility, low&#8208;immunogenicity, photo&#8208;luminescence, antioxidant properties, as well as cell&#8208;function regulating activities. These properties make sericin&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for biomedical applications. This review summarizes the properties and bioactivities of silk sericin and highlights the latest developments in sericin in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the extended application of sericin in developing flexible electronic devices and 3D bioprinting is also discussed. It is believed that sericin&#8208;based biomaterials have great potential of being developed into novel tissue engineering products and smart implantable devices for various medical applications toward improving clinical outcomes.

         <title>Recent Progress in Implantable Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the recent progress of implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs) with spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled drug release capabilities. The stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms, including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, electricity, magnetism, etc.) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of various IDDSs, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are discussed.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous effort is devoted to developing platforms, such as implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), with temporally and spatially controlled drug release capabilities and improved adherence. IDDSs have multiple advantages: i) the timing and location of drug delivery can be controlled by patients using specific stimuli (light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Some intelligent &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS can even realize self&#8208;management without human participation. ii) IDDSs enable continuous and stable delivery of drugs over a long period (months to years) and iii) to administer drugs directly to the lesion, thereby helping reduce dosage and side effects. iv) IDDSs enable personalized drug delivery according to patient needs. The high demand for such systems has prompted scientists to make efforts to develop intelligent IDDS. In this review, several common stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, proteins, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.), are given in detail. Besides, several types of IDDS reported in recent years are reviewed, including various stimulus&#8208;responsive systems based on the above mechanisms, radio frequency&#8208;controlled IDDS, &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS, self&#8208;powered IDDS, etc. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various IDDS, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are analyzed to provide directions for subsequent research.

         <title>From Nature&#8208;Sourced Polysaccharide Particles to Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosourced polysaccharide particles have promising applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, bioengineering, food industry, and several other fields. This review highlights progresses in advanced materials derived from polysaccharide particles, along as the description of their extraction, fabrication, and modification.








Abstract
Polysaccharides constitute over 90% of the carbohydrate mass in nature, which makes them a promising feedstock for manufacturing sustainable materials. Polysaccharide particles (PSPs) are used as effective scavengers, carriers of chemical and biological cargos, and building blocks for the fabrication of macroscopic materials. The biocompatibility and degradability of PSPs are advantageous for their uses as biomaterials with more environmental friendliness. This review highlights the progresses in PSP applications as advanced functional materials, by describing PSP extraction, preparation, and surface functionalization with a variety of functional groups, polymers, nanoparticles, and biologically active species. This review also outlines the fabrication of PSP&#8208;derived macroscopic materials, as well as their applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, and bioengineering. The paper is concluded with an outlook providing perspectives in the development and applications of PSP&#8208;derived materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the development of interfacial solar evaporation technologies, covering the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance photothermal materials and solar evaporators, the energy nexus of 2D and 3D evaporation systems, and the corresponding energy management strategies, and the explored applications to solve practical issues. The summarized knowledge offers a perspective for future study and development of the field.








Abstract
In the last decade, interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG), powered by natural sunlight garnered significant attention due to its great potential for low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly clean water production in alignment with the global decarbonization efforts. This review aims to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements toward practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing the energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio&#8208;fouling issues in practical applications, are elucidated and contemporary methods are discussed to overcome these challenges. In the end, potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, are introduced, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. Based on the review and in&#8208;depth understanding of these aspects, the future research focuses are proposed to address potential issues in both fundamental research and practical applications.

         <title>Degradation Mechanisms of Electrodes Promotes Direct Regeneration of Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has attracted considerable attention compared to traditional recycling methods. Only by having an adequate understanding of degradation mechanisms and defective types of failed materials can be found more suitable and efficient methods for direct repairing spent LIBs. A comprehensive overview of degradation mechanisms and regeneration methods for spent LIBs is provided.








Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle use is expected to cause a significant environmental problem in the next few years due to the large number of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Recycling spent LIBs will not only alleviate the environmental problems but also address the challenge of limited natural resources shortages. While several hydro&#8208; and pyrometallurgical processes are developed for recycling different components of spent batteries, direct regeneration presents clear environmental, and economic advantages. The principle of the direct regeneration approach is restoring the electrochemical performance by healing the defective structure of the spent materials. Thus, the development of direct regeneration technology largely depends on the formation mechanism of defects in spent LIBs. This review systematically details the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs are outlined. Also the main challenges and solutions for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs are proposed. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium&#8208;ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Film&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Assembly Toward Bioinspired Bulk Structural Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites have received extensive attention owing to the requirements of structural applications. In this review, the bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is highlighted as a simple, flexible, and scalable path toward fabricating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand. Specifically, its design principles, comprehensive advantages, flexible extensions, along with recent advances in bioinspired structural materials are discussed, respectively.








Abstract
Biological materials, although composed of meager minerals and biopolymers, often exhibit amazing mechanical properties far beyond their components due to hierarchically ordered structures. Understanding their structure&#8211;properties relationships and replicating them into artificial materials would boost the development of bulk structural nanocomposites. Layered microstructure widely exists in biological materials, serving as the fundamental structure in nanosheet&#8208;based nacres and nanofiber&#8208;based Bouligand tissues, and implying superior mechanical properties. High&#8208;efficient and scalable fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with precise layered microstructure is therefore important yet remains difficult. Here, one straightforward bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is focused for fabricating bioinspired layered bulk structural nanocomposites. The bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy inherently offers a methodology for precise construction of bioinspired layered microstructure in bulk form, availability for fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with large sizes and complex shapes, possibility for design of multiscale interfaces, feasibility for manipulation of diverse heterogeneities. Not limited to discussing what has been achieved by using the current bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy, it is also envisioned how to promote such an assembly strategy to better benefit the development of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites. Compared to other assembly strategies, the highlighted strategy provides great opportunities for creating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand.

         <title>Engineering Quantum Light Sources with Flat Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores latest development of leveraging flat&#8208;optics to generate ultra&#8208;compact quantum light sources with improved efficiency and added functionalities. It highlights photon&#8208;pair sources with nonlinear metasurfaces and single&#8208;photon emitters in 3D and 2D materials integrated with metasurfaces. The review also discusses current challenges and provide insights into the potential future directions for advancing flat&#8208;optics quantum light&#160;sources.








Abstract
Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, and precise sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift toward the utilization of &#8220;flat&#8221; optics with thickness at subwavelength scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness, scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate quantum light sources. Specifically, the generation of entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down&#8208;conversion in nonlinear metasurfaces, and single photon emission from quantum emitters including quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials are explored. The review covers theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. The diverse application range of these sources is discussed and the current challenges and perspectives in the field are&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Locally Strained 2D Materials: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
2D materials hold great promise in strain engineering. By introducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, localized and non&#8208;uniform strain can be induced, leading to novel phenomena and unique properties. This review systematically outlines the recent progress in the preparation, properties, and applications of locally strained 2D materials, aiming to broaden the scope of the 2D family for diverse applications.








Abstract
2D materials are promising for strain engineering due to their atomic thickness and exceptional mechanical properties. In particular, non&#8208;uniform and localized strain can be induced in 2D materials by generating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, resulting in novel phenomena and properties, as witnessed in recent years. Therefore, the locally strained 2D materials are of great value for both fundamental studies and practical applications. This review discusses techniques for introducing local strains to 2D materials, and their feasibility, advantages, and challenges. Then, the unique effects and properties that arise from local strain are explored. The representative applications based on locally strained 2D materials are illustrated, including memristor, single photon emitter, and photodetector. Finally, concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of locally strained 2D materials are provided.

&lt;p&gt;2D materials hold great promise in strain engineering. By introducing out-of-plane deformations, localized and non-uniform strain can be induced, leading to novel phenomena and unique properties. This review systematically outlines the recent progress in the preparation, properties, and applications of locally strained 2D materials, aiming to broaden the scope of the 2D family for diverse applications.

         <title>Unexpected Energy Applications of Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids and their various analogues are without doubt the scientific sensation of recent decades, paving the yellow brick road to a worldly version of Oz's green &#8220;Emerald city&#8221;&#8212;a more sustainable society. Their versatile properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of structures to serve a desired purpose.








Abstract
Ionic liquids and their various analogues are without doubt the scientific sensation of the last few decades, paving the way to a more sustainable society. Their versatile suite of properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of the structure to serve a desired purpose. Ionic liquids hence offer a myriad of useful applications from solvents to catalysts, through to lubricants, gas absorbers, and azeotrope breakers. The purpose of this review is to explore the more unexpected of these applications, particularly in the energy space. It guides the reader through the application of ionic liquids and their analogues as i) phase change materials for thermal energy storage, ii) organic ionic plastic crystals, which have been studied as battery electrolytes and in gas separation, iii) key components in the nitrogen reduction reaction for sustainable ammonia generation, iv) as electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries, and v) in other emerging technologies. It is concluded that there is tremendous scope for further optimizing and tuning of the ionic liquid in its task, subject to sustainability imperatives in line with current global priorities, assisted by artificial intelligence.
