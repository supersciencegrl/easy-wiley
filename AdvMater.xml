         <title>Controlled Isotropic Canalization of Micro&#8208;Sized Silicon Enabling Stable High&#8208;Rate and High&#8208;Loading Lithium Storage</title>

Abstract
Silicon is attractive for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond but suffers large volume change upon cycling. Hierarchical tactics show promise yet lack control over the unit construction and arrangement, limiting stability improvement at the practical level. Here, a protocol is developed as controlled isotropic canalization of micro&#8208;sized silicon. Distinct from the existing strategies, it involves isotropic canalization by honeycomb&#8208;like radial arrangement of silicon nanosheets, and canal consolidation by controlled dual bonding of silicon with carbon. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dual&#8208;bonded silicon honeycomb&#8208;like microparticles, specifically with a medium density of C&#8208;N&#8208;Si and C&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, exhibit stable cycling impressively at high rates and industrial&#8208;scale loadings. Two key issues involve isotropic canalization facilitating ion transport in all directions of individual granules and controlled consolidation conferring selective ion permeation and securing charge transport. The study highlights the configurational isotropy and interfacial bonding density, provides insight into rational design and manufacture of silicon and others with industry&#8208;viable features.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Contained Alloy as a Robustly&#8208;Adhered Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer for Planar and Stable Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stable zinc (Zn)/electrolyte interface is critical for developing rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZBs) with long&#8208;term stability, which requires the dense and stable Zn electrodeposition. Herein, we construct an interfacial lattice locking (ILL) layer via the electro&#8208;co&#8208;deposition of Zn and Cu onto the Zn electrodes. The ILL layer shows a low lattice misfit (&#948; = 0.036) with Zn (002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer. Benefiting from the unique orientation&#8208;guiding and robustly&#8208;adhered properties, the ILL layer enables the symmetric Zn||Zn cells to achieve an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of &gt; 6000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA/cm2 and 1 mAh/cm2, a low overpotential (65&#160;mV) at 10 mAh/cm2, and a stable Zn plating/stripping for &gt; 90&#160;h at an ultrahigh Zn discharge depth (DODZn = &#8764;85%). Even with a limited Zn supply and a high current density (8.58&#160;mA/cm2), the ILL@Zn||Ni&#8208;doped MnO2 cells could still survive for &gt; 2300 cycles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;halide Perovskite Lasers: Cavity Formation and Emission Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown remarkable optoelectronic properties as well as facile and cost&#8208;effective processability. With the success of MHP solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), MHPs have also exhibited great potential as gain media for on&#8208;chip lasers. However, to date, stable operation of optically pumped MHP lasers and electrically driven MHP lasers &#8212; an essential requirement for MHP laser's insertion into chip&#8208;scale photonic integrated circuits &#8212; have not yet been demonstrated. The main obstacles include the instability of MHPs in the atmosphere, rudimentary MHP laser cavity patterning methods, and insufficient understanding of emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of different strategies to improve the intrinsic properties of MHPs in the atmosphere and to establish an optimal MHP cavity patterning method. In addition, this review discusses different emission mechanisms in MHP materials and cavities and how to distinguish them.

         <title>Constructing uniform and stable mixed conductive layer to stabilize the solid&#8208;state electrolyte/Li interface by cold bonding at mild conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Due to high ionic conductivity, garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte has been a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) composed of Li3N and Li&#8208;In alloys was introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in&#8208;situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also promotes uniform Li deposition and inhibits the growth of Li dendrites. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of room temperature formed MCL&#8208;LLZ (RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ) is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and provided stable cycling performance over 2000 hours under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, this in&#8208;situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce the cost and eliminate the potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights the tremendous potential of this in&#8208;situ cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;like Nanozymes: Regulation, Rational Design, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multi&#8208;enzymic nanozymes, which have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multi&#8208;enzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally&#8208;responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multi&#8208;enzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, we systematically discussed the multi&#8208;enzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multi&#8208;catalytic activities. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multi&#8208;enzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multi&#8208;enzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>The First Demonstration of Strain&#8208;Controlled Periodic Ferroelectric Domains with Superior Piezoelectric Response in Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, we have demonstrated that large&#8208;area, periodic and controllable needle&#8208;like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to five&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large&#8208;area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, we have demonstrated that large-area, periodic and controllable needle-like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM-CdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to five-fold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large-area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional Hybrid Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Challenges remain hindering the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly for the nonstable interface between lead halide perovskite and charge extraction metal oxide layer. Herein, we report a simple yet scalable interfacial strategy to facilitate the assemble of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs and scale&#8208;up modules. The hybrid interfacial layer containing self&#8208;assembly triphenylamine and conjugated poly(arylamine) simultaneously improves the chemical stability, charge extraction and energy level alignment of hole&#8208;selective interface, meanwhile promoting perovskite crystallization. Consequently, the correspondent inverted PSCs and modules achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.5% and 20.7% (aperture area of 19.4 cm2), respectively. The PSCs maintained over 80% of its initial efficiency under one&#8208;sun equivalent illumination of 1200 hours. This strategy is also effective to perovskite with various bandgaps, demonstrating the highest PCE of 19.6% for the 1.76&#8208;eV bandgap PSCs. Overall, this work provides a simple yet scalable interfacial strategy for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted PSCs and modules.

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideways Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sizeable spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations based on the spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion can be manipulated by changing the annealing temperature, time, and the Hall&#8208;bar channel width, providing a novel approach to developing efficient spintronic devices.








Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but are&#160;incompatible with the mass production of devices, and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, it is shown that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component can be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8211;CuOx bilayer with sideways and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and can be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. The finding here provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

         <title>On the Road to the Frontiers of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review and Outlook of Graphene Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fascinating physicochemical properties endow graphene with great prospects in substituting the graphite&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This review aims to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes by means of systematically summarizing and in&#8208;depth analyzing the related advances for high&#8208;performance LIBs. Finally, future challenges and research directions associated with the practical application of graphene anodes are outlined.








Abstract
Graphene has long been recognized as a potential anode for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The past decade has witnessed the rapid advancement of graphene anodes, and considerable breakthroughs are achieved so far. In this review, the aim is to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes toward practical LIBs. The Li storage mechanism of graphene is started with&#160;and then the approaches to improve its electrochemical performance&#160;are comprehensively summarized. First, morphologically engineered graphene anodes with porous, spheric, ribboned, defective and holey structures display improved capacity and rate performance owing to their highly accessible surface area, interconnected diffusion channels, and sufficient active sites. Surface&#8208;modified graphene anodes with less aggregation, fast electrons/ions transportation, and optimal solid electrolyte interphase are discussed, demonstrating the close connection between the surface structure and electrochemical activity of graphene. Second, graphene derivatives anodes prepared by heteroatom doping and covalent functionalization are outlined, which show great advantages in boosting the Li storage performances because of the additionally introduced defect/active sites for further Li accommodation. Furthermore, binder&#8208;free and free&#8208;standing graphene electrodes are&#160;presented,&#160;exhibiting great prospects for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and flexible LIBs. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities of practically available graphene anodes for advanced LIBs are highlighted.

         <title>Active Textile Fabrics from Weaving Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crafting of active fabrics incorporating liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) yarn&#160;is&#160;reported. Two types of LCE yarns with different elasticities enable over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles and blocking force of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Active fabrics, responding autonomously to environmental changes, are the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of the development of smart textiles. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) promise to be the base materials for large&#8208;stroke reversible actuation. The mechanical behavior of LCEs matches almost exactly the human muscle. Yet, it has not been&#160;possible to produce filaments from LCEs that will be suitable for standard textile production methods, such as weaving. Based on the recent development of LCE fibers, here, the crafting of active fabrics incorporating LCE yarn, woven on a standard loom, giving control over the weave density and structure, is presented. Two types of LCE yarns (soft and stiff) and their incorporation into several weaving patterns are tested, and the &#8220;champions&#8221; identified: the twill pattern with stiffer LCE yarn that shows the greatest blocking force of 1&#8211;2&#160;N&#160;cm&#8722;1 , and the weft rib pattern with over 10% reversible actuation strain on repeated heating cycles. Reversible 3D shape changes of active fabric utilize the circular weaving patterns that lead to cone shapes upon heating. The seamless combination of active LCE yarns into the rich portfolio of existing passive yarns can be transformative in creating new stimuli&#8208;responsive actuating textiles.

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies toward the&#160;Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are successfully prepared through microenvironment modulation and applied as highly durable catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and zinc&#8211;air batteries. The vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics and stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C) are practically designed and synthesized through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100&#8201;000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the vacancies around metal&#8211;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8211;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electrocatalytical performances.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long-term stability is a great challenge. In this work, carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (Fe&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;N&#8211;C) are practically designed and synthesized through microenvironment modulation, achieving high-efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The Fe&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100&#8201;000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; loss. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the vacancies around metal&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal center, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, Fe&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs presented a high-power density and long-term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electrocatalytical performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;prepared BiFeO3 nanosheets are confirmed as ferroelectric single domains, and their potential in photocatalysis is identified by comparison&#160;with polydomain particles. Selective deposition of cocatalysts further boosts the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain BiFeO3 nanosheets. The superiority of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts is emphasized, which offers a path to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via a&#160;polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. In&#160;this&#160;work, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photodeposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of the&#160;single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Guided In Situ Genetic Engineering of Macrophages for Sustained Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome&#8208;editing strategy is reported, to specifically and permanently repolarize TAMs toward M1 phenotype without reconversion by blocking CSF1&#8208;R and SIRP&#945; expressions both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing the phagocytosis of tumor cells and eliciting robust antitumor immunity, while reducing systemic toxicities.








Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anticancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, X&#8208;ray&#8208;guided and triggered remote control of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites is established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhances M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improves antitumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Controlled Adhesion of Ice&#8212;Toward Ultraclean 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ice&#8208;aided transfer, ice&#8208;stamp transfer, and ice cleaning methods, completely free from polymer and solvents, are developed to yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in 2D materials, which&#160;will&#160;contribute&#160;to technological revolutions in 2D materials, and their associated structures and devices.








Abstract
The scalable 2D&#160;device fabrication and integration demand either the large&#8208;area synthesis or the post&#8208;synthesis transfer of 2D layers. While the direct synthesis of 2D materials on most targeted surfaces remains challenging, the transfer approach from the growth substrate onto the targeted surfaces offers an alternative pathway for applications and integrations. However, the current transfer techniques for 2D materials predominantly involve polymers and organic solvents, which are liable to contaminate or deform the ultrasensitive atomic layers. Here, novel ice&#8208;aided transfer and ice&#8208;stamp transfer methods are developed, in which water (ice) is the only medium in the entire process. In practice, the adhesion between various 2D materials and ice can be well controlled by temperature. Through such controlled adhesion of ice, it is shown that the new transfer methods can yield ultrahigh quality and exceptional cleanliness in transferred 2D flakes and continuous 2D films, and are applicable for a wide range of substrates. Furthermore, beyond transfer, ice can also be used for cleaning the surfaces of 2D materials at higher temperatures. These novel techniques can enable unprecedented ultraclean 2D materials surfaces and performances, and will contribute to the upcoming technological revolutions associated with 2D materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#63743;Fe Bonds for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt catalyst with Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O structure is constructed to tune the oxidation state of Pt for high catalytic efficiency of the diboration of alkynes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tuned structure, the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance at high temperature. Strikingly, the reaction can be catalyzed at room temperature with a relatively high turnover frequency.








Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains a grand challenge to date. Herein, a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#63743;Fe atomic bonds&#160;is&#160;reported, which are supported by defective Fe2O3&#160;nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials can greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545&#160;h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310&#160;h&#8722;1, which has been&#160;hardly achieved previously. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, it is demonstrated that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8211;Pt&#8211;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

         <title>Precisely Controllable Artificial Muscle with Continuous Morphing based on &#8220;Breathing&#8221; of Supramolecular Columns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid&#160;crystal polymer forms multichain supramolecular columnar assemblies. Through the cooperative movements of main&#8208;chains and side&#8208;chains, the uniaxially aligned polymer strip executes muscle&#8208;like continuous and reversible elongation/contraction. The irreversible photoisomerization of mesogens further endows the polymer strip with arm&#8208;like phototunable bending which can lift heavy load. Both deformations are under precise control of temperature.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles are natural motors executing sophisticated work through precise control of linear contraction. Although various liquid crystal polymers&#160;based artificial muscles have&#160;been designed, the mechanism based on mainly the order&#8211;disorder transition usually leads to discrete shape morphing, leaving arbitrary and precise deformation a huge challenge. Here, one novel photoresponsive hemiphasmidic side&#8208;chain liquid crystal polymer with a unique &#8220;breathing&#8221; columnar phase that enables continuous morphing is presented. Due to confinement inside the supramolecular columnar assembly, the cooperative movements of side&#8208;chains and backbones generate a significant negative thermal expansion and lead to temperature&#8208;controllable muscle&#8208;like elongation/contraction in the oriented polymer strip. The irreversible isomerization of the photoresponsive mesogens results in the synergistic phototunable bending and high&#8208;contrast fluorescence change. Based on the orthogonal responses to heat and light, controllable arm&#8208;like bending motions of this material, which is applicable in constructing advanced artificial muscles or intelligent soft robotics, are further demonstrated.

         <title>The Atomic Drill Bit: Precision Controlled Atomic Fabrication of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through direct and automated control over the electron beam scan pathway profile in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, metallic 1D&#8211;2D edge heterostructures are fabricated with atomic precision in semiconducting MoS2. This atomic fabrication workflow paves the way for precision controlled atomic fabrication of functional nanomaterials.








Abstract
The ability to deterministically fabricate nanoscale architectures with atomic precision is the central goal of nanotechnology, whereby highly localized changes in the atomic structure can be exploited to control device properties at their fundamental physical limit. Here, an automated, feedback&#8208;controlled atomic fabrication method is reported and the formation of 1D&#8211;2D heterostructures in MoS2 is demonstrated through selective transformations along specific crystallographic orientations. The atomic&#8208;scale probe of an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used, and the shape and symmetry of the scan pathway relative to the sample orientation are controlled. The focused and shaped electron beam is used to reliably create Mo6S6 nanowire (MoS&#8208;NW) terminated metallic&#8208;semiconductor 1D&#8211;2D edge structures within a pristine MoS2 monolayer with atomic precision. From these results, it is found that a triangular beam path aligned along the zig&#8208;zag sulfur terminated (ZZS)&#160;direction forms stable MoS&#8208;NW edge structures with the highest degree of fidelity without resulting in disordering of the surrounding MoS2 monolayer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are used to calculate the energetic barriers for the most stable atomic edge structures and atomic transformation pathways. These discoveries provide an automated method to improve understanding of atomic&#8208;scale transformations while opening a pathway toward more precise atomic&#8208;scale engineering of materials.

         <title>Colorful Triplet Excitons in Carbon Nanodots for Time Delay Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Time delay lighting offers an added period of buffer illumination for human eyes upon switching off the light. Long&#8208;lifetime emission from triplet excitons has outstanding potential, but the forbidden transition property due to the Pauli exclusion principle makes them dark, and it stays challenging to develop full&#8208;color and bright triplet excitons. Herein, triplet excitons emission from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) in carbon nanodots (CNDs) is achieved by confining multicolor CNDs emitters in NaCNO crystal. NaCNO crystal can isolate the CNDs, triplet excitons quenching caused by the excited state electrons aggregation induced energy transfer is suppressed, and the confinement crystal can furthermore promote phosphorescence by inhibiting the dissipation of the triplet excitons due to non&#8208;radiative transition. The phosphorescence from radiative recombination triplet excitons in the CNDs covers the spectral region from 300&#160;nm (UV) to 800&#160;nm (NIR), and the corresponding lifetimes can reach 15.8, 818.0, 239.7, 168.4, 426.4, and 127.6&#160;ms. Furthermore, the eco&#8208;friendly luminescent lampshade is designed based on the multicolor phosphorescent CNDs, time delay LEDs are thus demonstrated. The findings will motivate new opportunities for the development of UV to NIR phosphorescent CNDs and multicolor time delay lighting applications.

         <title>Fluid Flow Templating of Polymeric Soft Matter with Diverse Morphologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is challenging to find a conventional nanofabrication technique that can reproducibly produce soft polymeric matter of high surface area and nanoscale morphology in a way that is scalable, versatile, and easily tunable. Here, w e explore the capabilities of a universal method for fabricating diverse nano&#8208; and microscale morphologies based on polymer precipitation templated by the fluid streamlines in multiphasic flow. W e show that while the procedure is operationally simple, various combinations of its intertwined mechanisms can controllably and reproducibly lead to the formation of an extraordinary wide range of colloidal morphologies. By systematically investigating the process conditions, w e identified twelve distinct classes of polymer micro&#8208; and nanostructures, including particles, rods, ribbons, nanosheets and soft dendritic colloids (dendricolloids). The outcomes are interpreted by delineating the physical processes into three stages: hydrodynamic shear, capillary and mechanical breakup, and polymer precipitation rate. The insights into the underlying fundamental mechanisms guide us towards developing a versatile and scalable nanofabrication platform. W e verify that the liquid shear&#8208;based technique is versatile and works well with many chemically diverse polymers and biopolymers, showing potential as a universal tool for simple and scalable nanofabrication of many morphologically distinct soft matter classes.

         <title>Dry Lithography Patterning of Monolayer Flexible Field Effect Transistors by 2D Mica Stamping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer organic semiconductors (OSC) have demonstrated promising potentials for various applications, such as light emitting diode (LED) display drivers, logic circuits, and wearable electrocardiography (ECG) sensors. To date, the fabrications of this class of highly crystallized 2D organic semiconductors (OSC) are dominated by solution shearing. As these organic active layers are only a few molecular layers thick, their compatibilities with conventional thermal evaporated top electrodes or sophisticated photolithography patterning are very limited, which also restricts their device density. Here, we develop an electrode transfer stamp and a semiconductor patterning stamp to fabricate OFETs with channel lengths down to 3 &#956;m over a large area without using any chemicals or causing any damage to the active layer. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 2,9&#8208;didecyldinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (C10&#8208;DNTT) monolayer OFETs developed by this new approach shows decent performance properties with a low threshold voltage (VTH) less than 0.5 V, intrinsic mobility higher than 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a subthreshold swing (SS) less than 100 mV dec&#8722;1. The proposed patterning approach is completely comparable with ultra&#8208;flexible parylene substrate less than 2 &#956;m thick. By further reducing the channel length down to 2 &#956;m and using the monolayer OFET in an AC/DC rectifying circuit, the measured cutoff frequency is up to 17.3 MHz with an input voltage of 4 V. The newly proposed electrode transfer and patterning stamps have addressed the long&#8208;lasting compatibility problem of depositing electrodes onto 2D organic monolayer and the semiconductor patterning. It opens a new path to reduce the fabrication cost and simplify the manufacturing process of high&#8208;density OFETs for more advanced electronic or biomedical applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosonosensitizers Facilitate Energy Transfer to Enhance Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown promise for cancer treatment, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers (SSs) has limited the clinical application of SDT. Here we report a new strategy for designing efficient nanosonosensitizers based on two&#8208;dimensional nanoscale metal&#8722;organic layers (MOLs). Composed of Hf&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) and iridium&#8208;based linkers (DBB&#8208;Ir), the MOL was anchored with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) sensitizers on the SBUs to afford TBP@MOL. TBP@MOL showed 14.1&#8208; and 7.4&#8208;fold higher singlet oxygen (1O2) generation than free TBP ligands and Hf&#8208;TBP, a three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework, respectively. The 1O2 generation of TBP@MOL is enhanced by isolating TBP SSs on the SBUs of the MOL, which prevents aggregation&#8208;induced quenching of the excited sensitizers, and by triplet&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer between excited DBB&#8208;Ir bridging ligands and TBP SSs, which more efficiently captures the broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence. Anchoring TBP SSs on the MOL surface also enhances the energy transfer between the excited sensitizer and ground&#8208;state triplet oxygen to increase 1O2 generation efficacy. In mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer, TBP@MOL demonstrated significantly higher SDT efficacy than Hf&#8208;TBP and TBP. This work uncovers a new strategy to design effective nanosonosensitizers by facilitating energy transfer to efficiently capture broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence and enhance 1O2 generation.

         <title>Regulating Inorganic and Organic Components to Build Amorphous&#8208;ZnFx Enriched Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Zn Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The introduction of inorganic crystallites into a solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy for improving the reversibility of Zn metal anode (ZMA). However, the structure&#8211;performance relationship of the SEI is not fully understood because the existing forms of its inorganic and organic components in their pristine states have not been resolved. Here, we constructed a highly effective SEI for ZMA using a bisolvent electrolyte and resolved its composition/structure by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. This highly fluorinated SEI with amorphous inorganic ZnFx uniformly distributed in the organic matrix was largely different from the common mosaic and multilayer SEIs with crystalline inorganics. It featured improved structural integrity, mechanical toughness, and Zn2+ ion conductivity. Consequently, the ZMA exhibited excellent reversibility with an enhanced plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The ZMA&#8208;based full cell achieved a high Zn utilization ratio of 54% at a practical areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling over 1800&#160;h during which the accumulated capacity reached 5600 mAh cm&#8722;2. This research highlights the detailed structure and composition of amorphous SEIs for highly reversible metal anodes.

         <title>Duplex Responsive Nanoplatform with Cascade Targeting for Atherosclerosis Photoacoustic Diagnosis and Multichannel Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The culprits of atherosclerosis are endothelial damage, local disorders of lipid metabolism and progressive inflammation. Early atherosclerosis is typically difficult to diagnose in time due to the lack of obvious symptoms, thus missing the best period of treatment. In this work, we designed a &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer (PMeTPP&#8208;MBT) based on 3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4(2H,5H)&#8208;dione as a novel photoacoustic contrast agent. On this basis, an intelligent responsive theranostic nanoplatform (PA/ASePSD) combining astaxanthin and SS&#8208;31 peptide and loading with PMeTPP&#8208;MBT has been developed. The high affinity between the dextran shell with the broken endothelial surface VCAM&#8208;1 and CD44 confers active targeting of PA/ASePSD to atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of ROS in the acidic plaque microenvironment act as an intelligent cascade switch to achieve controlled release of astaxanthin, SS&#8208;31 peptide and PMeTPP&#8208;MBT for non&#8208;invasive photoacoustic diagnosis, as well as plaque inhibition mediated by anti&#8208;inflammation and multichannel regulation (including ABCA1, ABCG1, CD36 and LOX&#8208;1) of lipid metabolism. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm the impressive anti&#8208;atherosclerotic capability and the accurate photoacoustic diagnosis of PA/ASePSD nanoparticles, thus promising a candidate for early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis theranostics.

         <title>Volumetric Printing of Thiol&#8208;Ene Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linkable Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone): a Tunable Material Platform serving Biomedical Applications</title>

Abstract
Current thoroughly described biodegradable and cross&#8208;linkable polymers mainly rely on acrylate cross&#8208;linking. However, despite the swift cross&#8208;linking kinetics of acrylates, the concomitant brittleness of the resulting materials limits their applicability. Here, we introduce photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable PCL networks through orthogonal thiol&#8208;ene chemistry. The step&#8208;growth polymerized networks are tunable, predictable by means of the rubber elasticity theory and it is shown that their mechanical properties are significantly improved over their acrylate cross&#8208;linked counterparts. Tunability is introduced to the materials, by altering Mc (or the molar mass between cross&#8208;links), and its effect on the thermal properties, mechanical strength and degradability of the materials is evaluated. Moreover, excellent volumetric printability is illustrated and we report the smallest features obtained via volumetric 3D&#8208;printing to date, for thiol&#8208;ene systems. Finally, by means of in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo characterization of 3D&#8208;printed constructs, we illustrate that the volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed materials are biocompatible. This combination of mechanical stability, tunability, biocompatibility and rapid fabrication by volumetric 3D&#8208;printing charts a new path towards bedside manufacturing of biodegradable patient&#8208;specific implants.

         <title>Van der Waals Multilayer Heterojunction for Low&#8208;Voltage Organic RGB Area&#8208;Emitting Transistor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals multilayer heterojunction methodology is proposed to realize an organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) array. The OLET array shows uniform RGB area emission and low operating voltage &lt;30&#160;V. Furthermore, a high brightness of under area emission 1060&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a high EQE value of 0.85%, and good operational stability indicate that the multilayer heterojunction is significantly superior to contemporary device structures.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) have garnered considerable attention from academy and industry due to their potential applications in next&#8208;generation display technologies, multifunctional devices, and organic electrically pumped lasers. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;offs among power consumption, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and uniform area emission remains a long&#8208;standing issue for OLETs. Herein, a van der Waals multilayer heterojunction methodology is proposed to enhance the layer&#8208;to&#8208;layer interfacial interaction and contact, resulting in better dipole shielding, carrier transport, exciton recombination, and current density distribution. The prepared multilayer heterojunction OLET (MLH&#8208;OLET) array shows uniform and bright RGB area emission and low operating voltage (&lt;30&#160;V among the lowest applied voltage of reported lateral LETs). Additionally, a high brightness under area emission of 1060&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a high EQE value of 0.85%, and a high loop stability (over 380 cycles, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLETs) indicate that the proposed multilayer heterojunction is obviously superior to the reported lateral device configuration. The van der Waals multilayer heterojunction developed for the preparation of OLET arrays sufficiently meets the low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost requirements of future display technologies.

         <title>Nanoheterojunction&#8208;Mediated Thermoelectric Strategy for Cancer Surgical Adjuvant Treatment and &#946;&#8208;Elemene Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction&#8208;based thermoelectric therapeutic strategy as either an independent cancer therapy or combination cancer therapy with &#946;&#8208;elemene is proposed. Moreover, the combination of heterojunction and hydrogel is administrated on the surface of the wound after surgery, achieving efficient residual tumor treatment and antibacterial effects.








Abstract
As an indispensable strategy for tumor treatment, surgery may cause two major challenges: tumor recurrence and wound infection. Here, a thermoelectric therapeutic strategy is provided as either an independent cancer therapy or surgical adjuvant treatment. Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (BST) and Bi2Te2.8Se0.2 (BTS) nanoplates composed of Z&#8208;scheme thermoelectric heterojunction (BST/BTS) are fabricated via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal processes. The contact between BST and BTS constructs an interfacial electric field due to Fermi energy level rearrangement, guiding electrons in the conductive band (CB) of BTS combine with the holes in the valance band (VB) of BST, leaving stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of electrons and holes in the CB of BST and the VB of BTS. Moreover, under a mild temperature gradient, another self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field is formed facilitating the migration of electrons and holes to their surfaces. Based on the PEGylated BST/BTS heterojunction, a novel thermoelectric therapy platform is developed through intravenous injection of BST/BTS and external cooling of the tumors. This thermoelectric strategy is also proved effective for combination cancer therapy with &#946;&#8208;elemene. Moreover, the combination of heterojunction and hydrogel is administrated on the wound after surgery, achieving efficient residual tumor treatment and antibacterial effects.

         <title>Space&#8208;Charge Control of Magnetism in Ferromagnetic Metals: Coupling Giant Magnitude and Robust Endurance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through decoupling the transport of ions and electrons, a space&#8208;charge mechanism to achieve magnetoelectric coupling in FM&#8208;metal films is introduced. This method combines the advantages of both carrier doping and chemical reaction mechanisms, which allows for an efficient modulation with both large&#8208;magnitude (0.32 &#181;B Co&#8722;1, 1.451 electron/Co) and robust endurance (&gt;5000 cycles) under 1.3&#160;V.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic metals show great prospects in ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic devices, due to their high Curie temperature and robust magnetization. However, there is still a lack of reliable solutions for giant and reversible voltage control of magnetism in ferromagnetic metal films. Here, a novel space&#8208;charge approach is proposed which allows for achieving a modulation of 30.3 emu/g under 1.3&#160;V in Co/TiO2 multilayer granular films. The robust endurance with more than 5000 cycles is demonstrated. Similar phenomena exist in Ni/TiO2 and Fe/TiO2 multilayer granular films, which shows its universality. The magnetic change of 107% in Ni/TiO2 underlines its potential in a voltage&#8208;driven ON&#8211;OFF magnetism. Such giant and reversible voltage control of magnetism can be ascribed to space&#8208;charge effect at the ferromagnetic metals/TiO2 interfaces, in which spin&#8208;polarized electrons are injected into the ferromagnetic metal layer with the adsorption of lithium&#8208;ions on the TiO2 surface. These results open the door for a promising method to modulate the magnetization in ferromagnetic metals, paving the way toward the development of ionic&#8208;magnetic&#8208;electric coupled applications.

         <title>Breaking the Electronic Conductivity Bottleneck of Manganese Oxide Family for High&#8208;Power Fluorinated Graphite Composite Cathode by Ligand&#8208;Field High&#8208;Dimensional Constraining Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;induced high&#8208;dimensional constraining strategy is proposed from the perspective of ligand&#8208;field stacking structure topological design, to break the intrinsic electronic conductivity bottleneck of traditional manganese oxides. Accordingly, high&#8208;conductivity mixed&#8208;valent Mn5O8 is explored through first&#8208;principles phase diagram calculations and works as a composite component to achieve 136% increasement in power density (11399&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1) for fluorinated graphite cathode.








Abstract
Primary lithium fluorinated graphite (Li/CFx) batteries with superior energy density are an indispensable energy supply for multiple fields but suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics of the CFx cathode. Designing composite cathodes emerges as a solution to this problem. Despite the optimal composite component for CFx, the manganese oxide family represented by MnO2 is still faced with an intrinsic electronic conductivity bottleneck, which severely limits the power density of the composite cathode. Here, a cation&#8208;induced high&#8208;dimensional constraining strategy from the perspective of ligand&#8208;field stacking structure topological design, which breaks the molecular orbital hybridization of pristine semiconductive oxides to transform them into the high&#8208;conductivity metallic state while competitively maintaining structural stability, is proposed. Through first&#8208;principles phase diagram calculations, mixed&#8208;valent Mn5O8 (Mn22+Mn34+O8${\rm{Mn}}_2^{2 + }{\rm{Mn}}_3^{4 + }{{\rm{O}}_8}$) is explored as an ideal high&#8208;dimensional constraining material with satisfied conductivity and large&#8208;scale production feasibility. Experiments demonstrate that the as&#8208;proposed CFx&#8202;@&#8202;Mn5O8 composite cathode achieves 2.36&#160;times the power density (11399 W&#160;kg&#8722;1) of pristine CFx and a higher CFx conversion ratio (86%). Such a high&#8208;dimensional field&#8208;constraining strategy is rooted in the established four&#8208;quadrant electronic structure tuning framework, which fundamentally changes the orbital symmetry under the ligand field to overcome the common conductivity challenge of wide transition metal oxide materials.

         <title>Orbital&#8208;Hybridization&#8208;Driven Charge Density Wave Transition in CsV3Sb5 Kagome Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct participation of the V3d&#8211;Sb5p orbital hybridization has been observed to mediate the charge density wave phase (CDW) transition in kagome unconventional superconductors, with the inverse Star of David structure deduced as the preferred configuration. These findings highlight the pivotal roles orbital hybridization plays in dictating quantum phase&#8208;transition dynamics in multiple unconventional quantum systems.








Abstract
Owing to its inherent non&#8208;trivial geometry, the unique structural motif of the recently discovered kagome topological superconductor AV3Sb5 (A&#8201;=&#8201;K, Rb, Cs) is an ideal host of diverse topologically non&#8208;trivial phenomena, including giant anomalous Hall conductivity, topological charge order, charge density wave (CDW), and unconventional superconductivity. Despite possessing a normal&#8208;state CDW order in the form of topological chiral charge order and diverse superconducting gaps structures, it remains unclear how fundamental atomic&#8208;level properties and many&#8208;body effects including Fermi surface nesting, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and orbital hybridization contribute to these symmetry&#8208;breaking phenomena. Here, the direct participation of the V3d&#8211;Sb5p orbital hybridization in mediating the CDW phase transition in CsV3Sb5 is reported. The combination of temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray absorption and first&#8208;principles studies clearly indicates the inverse Star&#8208;of&#8208;David structure as the preferred reconstruction in the low&#8208;temperature CDW phase. The results highlight the critical role that Sb orbitals play and establish orbital hybridization as the direct mediator of the CDW states and structural transition dynamics in kagome unconventional superconductors. This is a significant step toward the fundamental understanding and control of the emerging correlated phases from the kagome lattice through the orbital interactions and provides promising approaches to novel regimes in unconventional orders and topology.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nano&#8208;Optogenetic Activation of Cancer Immunotherapy via Engineered Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is designed to specifically release encoded flagellin B (flaB) in response to near&#8208;infrared light for tumor&#8208;specific nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm irradiation, flaB activates the immune response via binding to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to induce significant tumor regression in different tumor models.








Abstract
Certain anaerobic microbes with the capability to colonize the tumor microenvironment tend to express the heterologous gene in a sustainable manner, which will inevitably compromise the therapeutic efficacy and induce off&#8208;tumor toxicity in vivo. To improve the therapeutic precision and controllability of bacteria&#8208;based therapeutics, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), engineered to sense blue light and release the encoded flagellin B (flaB), is conjugated with lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88&#8208;dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects. These studies based on the NIR nano&#8208;optogenetic platform highlight the rational of leveraging the optogenetic tools combined with natural propensity of certain bacteria for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Improved Molecular Ordering in a Ternary Blend Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend have been finely modulated by using a ternary strategy. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary blend features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering, which leads to an efficiency of 18.03%, representing the highest efficiency for all&#8208;polymer solar cells thus far.








Abstract
Although all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) show great commercialization prospects, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still fall behind their small molecule acceptor&#8208;based counterparts. In all&#8208;polymer blends, the optimized morphology and high molecular ordering are difficult to achieve since there is troublesome competition between the crystallinity of the polymer donor and acceptor during the film&#8208;formation process. Therefore, it is&#160;challenging to improve the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. Herein, a ternary strategy is adopted to modulate the morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend, in which PM6:PY&#8208;82 is selected as the host blend and PY&#8208;DT is employed as a guest component. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary matrix features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering. Consequently, the champion PM6:PY&#8208;82:PY&#8208;DT device produces a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.03%, with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor in comparison with the binary devices. High&#8208;performance large&#8208;area (1 cm2) and thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) all&#8208;PSCs are also successfully fabricated with PCEs of 16.35% and 15.70%, respectively.Moreover, 16.5&#160;cm2 organic solar module affords an encouraging PCE of 13.84% when using the non&#8208;halogenated solvent , showing the great potential of &#8220;Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab&#8221; transition of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Inverted and Amplified CP&#8208;EL Behavior Promoted by AIE&#8208;Active Chiral Co&#8208;Assembled Helical Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE&#8208;active chiral co&#8208;assembled helical nanofibers as EML of CP&#8208;OLEDs can render excellent CP&#8208;EL performance (|gEL|&#160;= 0.023, &#955;em&#160;= 533&#160;nm) through thermal annealing treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the inverted and amplified CPL behavior can be ascribed to the formation of an ordered helical co&#8208;assembly through the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction between AIE&#8208;active chiral molecules and achiral dye.








Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) remain a formidable challenge to the future application of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, the design of a pair of AIE&#8208;active chiral enantiomers (L/D&#8208;HP) is described to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral naphthalimide dye (NTi). The resulting co&#8208;assemblies emit an inverted CPL signal compared with that from the L/D&#8208;HP enantiomers. After thermal annealing at 120&#160;&#176;C, the inverted CPL signal of this kind of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi with a 1:1 molar ratio shows regular and ordered helical nanofibers arranged through intermolecularly ordered layered packing and is accompanied with a further amplified effect (|gem|&#160;= 0.032, &#955;em&#160;= 535&#160;nm). Significantly, non&#8208;doped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on a device emitting layer (EML) of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage (Von) of 4.7&#160;V, a high maximum brightness (Lmax) of 2001&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and moderate maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.3%, as well as excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) (|gEL|&#160;= 0.023, &#955;em&#160;= 533&#160;nm).

         <dc:description>
A bioinspired design concept to endow metal films with 200% stretchability and room&#8208;temperature integration capability with diverse components is reported. By controllable implantation of defects, distinctive venation&#8208;mimicking cracking modes are induced in strained films, leading to intriguing exponential&#8208;to&#8208;linear transition of the film's electromechanical performance. Combined with room&#8208;temperature integration capability, an integrated electronic skin is constructed, showing prospects in helping disabled people.








Abstract
Future electronic skin systems require stretchable conductors and low&#8208;temperature integration of external components, which remains challenging for traditional metal films. Herein, a bioinspired design concept is reported to endow metal films with 200% stretchability as well as room&#8208;temperature integration capability with diverse components. It is revealed that by controllable implantation of defects, distinctive venation&#8208;mimicking cracking modes can be induced in strained metal films, leading to profound stretchability regulation. An intriguing exponential&#8208;to&#8208;linear transition of the film electromechanical performance is observed, which is elucidated by a unified model covering the essence of all modes. Combined with room&#8208;temperature integration capability, an integrated electronic skin is constructed with metal films serving as stretchable electrodes, diverse sensors, and &#8220;tapes&#8221; to attach subcomponents, showing prospects in helping disabled people. This one&#8208;step, defect implantation strategy is applicable to common metals without special substrate treatments, which enables fascinating ultrastretchable metal film conductors with low&#8208;temperature integration capability to spark more sophisticated flexible electronic systems.

A series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators is developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. High&#8208;efficient excitation energy transfer from the cluster&#8208;based antenna to the Ln(III) ions enables Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs and their flexible film with excellent scintillation performance and high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Scintillator&#8208;based X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted great attention from industrial quality inspection and security to medical diagnostics. Herein, a series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators are developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the heavy inorganic units ([Cu4I4] clusters) absorb the X&#8208;ray energy to populate triplet excitons via halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (XLCT) combined with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) state (defined as the X/MLCT state), and then the 3X/MLCT excited state sensitizes Tb3+ for intense X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence via excitation energy transfer. The obtained Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOF scintillators exhibit high resistance to humidity and radiation, excellent linear response to X&#8208;ray dose rate, and high X&#8208;ray relative light yield of 29 379&#160;&#177;&#160;3000 photons MeV&#8722;1. The relative light yield of Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs is &#8776;3 times higher than that of the control Tb(III) complex. X&#8208;ray imaging tests show that the Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs&#8208;based flexible scintillator film exhibits a high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. These findings not only provide a promising design strategy to develop lanthanide&#8208;MOF&#8208;based scintillators with excellent scintillation performance, but also exhibit high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging for biological specimens and electronic chips.

         <title>A Hybrid Acceptor&#8208;Modulation Strategy: Fluorinated Triple&#8208;Acceptor Architecture for Significant Enhancement of Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Unipolar n&#8208;Type Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy is demonstrated based on DPP&#8208;containing fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture (DFB). Therefore, the DFB&#8208;based polymers feature low&#8208;lying FMO levels, shape&#8208;persistent backbones, and high crystallinity. The above features lead to an electron mobility of 5.04&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 in unipolar n&#8208;type transistors, which is the highest electron mobility for DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers reported to date.








Abstract
The development of unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers with electron mobility (&#181;e) over 5&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 remains a massive challenge in organic semiconductors. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has proven to be a successful unit for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type and ambipolar polymers. However, DPP's moderate electron&#8208;accepting capability leads to the shallow frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels of the resultant polymers and hence limit the &#181;e in unipolar n&#8208;type organic transistors. Herein, this issue has been addressed by using a hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy based on DPP&#8208;containing &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221;, namely DPP&#8208;difluorobenzothiadiazole&#8208;DPP (DFB). Compared with DFB's non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, DFB features deeper FMO levels and a shape&#8208;persistent framework. Therefore, a series of DFB&#8208;based polymers demonstrate planar backbones and lowered FMO levels by &#8776;0.10 to 0.25&#160;eV versus that of the control polymer. Intriguingly, all DFB&#8208;polymers exhibit excellent unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performances. Notably, a full&#8208;locked backbone conformation and high crystallinity with crystalline coherence length of 524&#160;&#197; are observed for pDFB&#8208;TF, accounting for its high &#181;e of 5.04&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest &#181;e value for DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type polymers reported to date. This work demonstrates that the strategy of &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221; opens a new path towards high&#8208;performance unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.

         <title>Tube&#8208;Sponge&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Electrocatalysts with Boosted Mass and Electron Transfer for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deep&#8208;sea sponges, a hierarchical electrode of porous nickel microtube arrays decorated with 2D NiFe&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;pore nanosheets is fabricated. It exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and yields a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 over 360 h at the potential of 1.52 V (versus RHE).








Abstract
Hindered gas bubble release and limited electron conducting process represent the major bottlenecks for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. Both the desorption of bubbles and continuous electron transport are achievable on the surfaces of biomimetic catalytic materials by designing multiscale structural hierarchy. Inspired by the tubular structures of the deep&#8208;sea&#160;sponges, an exceptionally active and binder&#8208;free porous nickel tube arrays (PNTA) decorated with NiFe&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;pore nanosheets (NiFe&#8208;PZn) are fabricated. The PNTA facilitate removal of bubbles and electron transfer in the oxygen evolution reaction by reproducing trunks of the sponges, and simultaneously, the NiFe&#8208;PZn increase the number of catalytic active sites by simulating the sponge epidermis. With improved external mass transfer and interior electron transfer, the hierarchical NiFe&#8208;PZn@PNTA electrode exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (with a Tafel slope of 50&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, this electrocatalytic system recorded excellent reaction stability over 360&#160;h with a constant current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the potential of 1.52&#160;V (versus RHE). This work provides a new strategy of designing hierarchical electrocatalysts for highly efficient water splitting.

         <title>A 3D Framework with Li3N&#8211;Li2S Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Fast Ion Transfer Channels for a Stabilized Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ artificial inorganic solid electrolyte interface layer is designed, consisting of lithium nitride and lithium sulfide, to provide fast Li&#8208;ion kinetics and high mechanical strength. In addition, the graphene oxide host is constructed with evenly spaced microchannels to address the volume change and dendrite growth issues.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;metal anode has been recognized as the most promising anode for its high theoretical capacity and low reduction potential. However, the major drawbacks of Li metal, such as high reactivity and large volume expansion, can lead to dendrite growth and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) fracture. An in situ artificial inorganic SEI layer, consisting of lithium nitride and lithium sulfide, is herein reported to address the dendrite growth issues. Porous graphene oxide films are doped with sulfur and nitrogen (denoted as SNGO) to work as an effective lithium host. The SNGO film enables the in situ formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer, which facilitates the transport of Li&#8208;ions, improves SEI mechanical strength, and avoids SEI fracture. In addition, COMSOL simulation results reveal that the microchannels fabricated by the 3D printing technique further shorten the Li&#8208;ion transfer pathways and homogenize heat and stress distribution in the batteries. As a result, the assembled anode shows low capacity fading of 0.1% per cycle at 2 C rate with the sulfur cathode. In addition, the high lithium utilization of the SNGO host enables the anode to provide a stable capacity at low negative/positive electrode ratios under 3 in Li&#63743;S batteries.

         <title>Gold Nanobipyramid&#8208;Mediated Apoptotic Camouflage of Adipocytes for Obesity Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, an immunotherapy for obesity treatment is developed for the first time to activate macrophages resident in adipose tissue to clear adipocytes by camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic features by gold nanobipyramids, which not only induce&#160;significant weight loss but also prevent weight regain, holding great potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Obesity treatment is a global public health challenge due to inadequate weight loss and weight regain even after endeavors with multimodal treatments. Considering the abundance of resident macrophages in adipose tissues, precise regulation of the interactions between macrophages and adipocytes may provide chances for immunotherapy of obesity. Herein, inspired by the phagocytosis of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells in homeostasis, an immunotherapy strategy for obesity treatment is proposed for the first time through apoptotic camouflage of adipocytes by PAAu BPs to activate macrophages for clearance, where PAAu BPs are gold nanobipyramids engineered with adipose&#8208;targeting and apoptotic cell&#8208;mimicking functions. During clearance, the&#160;macrophage is switched from pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 to anti&#8208;inflammatory M2, remarkably modulating the immune microenvironment of adipose tissues to prevent weight regain. After inguinal injection with PAAu BPs, the body weights of obese mice are effectively decreased by 24.4% and can be decreased by 33.3% when combined with photothermal lipolysis, and little weight regain is associated with these treatments. This study demonstrates that the strategy of camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic features holds great potential for obesity immunotherapy.

         <title>Entering a New Dimension in Powder Processing for Advanced Ceramics Shaping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entering a new dimension in powder processing of advanced ceramics with not yet reached geometrical resolution is realized by two&#8208;photon polymerization of colloidal suspensions. Light scattering is reduced by using extremely well&#8208;dispersed zirconia nanoparticles providing transparent suspensions with up to 80 wt% solid loading. Mechanical properties of manufactured structures are outstanding.








Abstract
Filigree structures can be manufactured via two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) operating in the regime of nonlinear light absorption. For the first time, it is possible to apply this technique to the powder processing of ceramic structures with a feature size in the range of the critical defect sizes responsible for brittle fracture and, thus, affecting fracture toughness of high&#8208;performance ceramics. In this way, tailoring of advanced properties can be achieved already in the shaping process. Traditionally, 2PP relies on transparent polymerizable resins, which are diametrically opposed to the usually completely opaque ceramic resins and slurries. Here a transparent and photocurable suspension of nanoparticles (resin) with very high mass fractions of yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia particles (YSZ) is presented. Due to the extremely well&#8208;dispersed nanoparticles, scattering of light can be effectively suppressed at the process&#8208;relevant wavelength of 800&#160;nm. Sintered ceramic structures with a resolution of down to 500&#160;nm are obtained. Even at reduced densities of 1&#8211;4&#160;g cm&#8722;3, the resulting compressive strength with 4.5&#160;GPa is equivalent or even exceeding bulk monolithic yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia. A ceramic metamaterial is born, where the mechanical properties of yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia are altered by changing geometrical parameters, and gives access to a new class of ceramic materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Spectroscopy of Plasmons and Free Carriers in 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcitations in Ti3C2, Mo2Ti2C3, and Nb2C, are investigated using transient optical absorption and time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy. All three MXenes exhibit pronounced plasmonic effects in the visible and near&#8208;IR. Optical excitation rapidly increases lattice temperature, evidenced by a phonon bleach in transient absorption measurements. Slow cooling, proceeding over hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds time scales, is attributed to their low thermal conductivities.








Abstract
2D MXenes have diverse and chemically tunable optical properties that arise from an interplay between free carriers, interband transitions, and plasmon resonances. The nature of photoexcitations and their dynamics in three different members of the MXene family, Ti3C2, Mo2Ti2C3, and Nb2C, are investigated using two complementary pump&#8208;probe techniques, transient optical absorption, and time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Measurements reveal pronounced plasmonic effects in the visible and near&#8208;IR in all three. Optical excitation, with either 400 or 800&#160;nm pulses, results in a rapid increase in lattice temperature, evidenced by a pronounced broadening of the plasmon mode that presents as a plasmon bleach in transient absorption measurements. Observed kinetics of plasmon bleach recovery provide a means to monitor lattice cooling. Remarkably slow cooling, proceeding over hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds time scales, implies MXenes have low thermal conductivities. The slowest recovery kinetics are observed in the MXene with the highest free carrier density, viz. Ti3C2, that supports phonon scattering by free carriers as a possible mechanism limiting thermal conductivity. These new insights into photoexcitation dynamics can facilitate their applications in photothermal solar energy conversion, plasmonic devices, and even photothermal therapy and drug delivery.

         <title>3D Bioelectronics with a Remodellable Matrix for Long&#8208;Term Tissue Integration and Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronic devices have exceptional potential for understanding and treating a host of diseases, but these devices are difficult to place into the body for long&#8208;term usage. Regenerative medicine provides a mechanism to promote integration between tissue and device. Here, it is shown that by using hybrid fabrication techniques, one can seamlessly fuse bioelectronic implants into tissue for long&#8208;term, high&#8208;resolution recordings.








Abstract
Bioelectronics hold the key for understanding and treating disease. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;term interfaces between electronics and the body remains a challenge. Implantation of a bioelectronic device typically initiates a foreign body response, which can limit long&#8208;term recording and stimulation efficacy. Techniques from regenerative medicine have shown a high propensity for promoting integration of implants with surrounding tissue, but these implants lack the capabilities for the sophisticated recording and actuation afforded by electronics. Combining these two fields can achieve the best of both worlds. Here, the construction of a hybrid implant system for creating long&#8208;term interfaces with tissue is shown. Implants are created by combining a microelectrode array with a bioresorbable and remodellable gel. These implants are shown to produce a minimal foreign body response when placed into musculature, allowing one to record long&#8208;term electromyographic signals with high spatial resolution. This device platform drives the possibility for a new generation of implantable electronics for long&#8208;term interfacing.

Combining these two fields can achieve the best of both worlds. Here, the construction of a hybrid implant system for creating long-term interfaces with tissue is shown. Implants are created by combining a microelectrode array with a bioresorbable and remodellable gel. These implants are shown to produce a minimal foreign body response when placed into musculature, allowing one to record long-term electromyographic signals with high spatial resolution. This device platform drives the possibility for a new generation of implantable electronics for long-term interfacing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Insight into Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries with Promising Selenium Sulfide@Carbon Nanofibers Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via constructing sufficient valence electronic energy overlapped with aluminum ions and easily accessible structure, an unexplored high&#8208;performance Se2.9S5.1 cathode in rechargeable aluminum batteries is proposed with detailed mechanism characterizations. Through this new strategy, multichannel selenium sulfide@carbon nanofiber (Se2.9S5.1@MCNF) exhibits high capacity (606 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1), high rate&#8208;capacity (211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1), and robust stability.








Abstract
Due to the unique electronic structure of aluminum ions (Al3+) with strong Coulombic interaction and complex bonding situation (simultaneously covalent/ionic bonds), traditional electrodes, mismatching with the bonding orbital of Al3+, usually exhibit slow kinetic process with inferior rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) performance. Herein, to break the confinement of the interaction mismatch between Al3+ and the electrode, a previously unexplored Se2.9S5.1&#8208;based cathode with sufficient valence electronic energy overlap with Al3+ and easily accessible structure is potentially developed. Through this new strategy, Se2.9S5.1 encapsulated in multichannel carbon nanofibers with free&#8208;standing structure exhibits a high capacity of 606 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, high rate&#8208;capacity&#160;(211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1), robust stability (187 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 3,000 cycles), and enhanced flexibility. Simultaneously, in/ex&#8208;situ characterizations also reveal the unexplored mechanism of SexSy in RABs.

         <title>Surface Hydrophobization Provides Hygroscopic Supramolecular Plastics Based on Polysaccharides with Damage&#8208;Specific Healability and Room&#8208;Temperature Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface hydrophobization strategy is offered to achieve damage&#8208;specific healing for hygroscopic supramolecular plastic films. The surface alkylation protects the intact surface of the films from water&#8208;induced plasticization, which eliminates random self&#8208;adhesion. Thus, self&#8208;adhesion exclusively occurs at the damage sites, where fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose, leading to damage&#8208;specific healing.








Abstract
Supramolecular materials with room&#8208;temperature healability and recyclability are highly desired because they can extend materials lifetimes and reduce resources consumption. Most approaches toward healing and recycling rely on the dynamically reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen, ionic and coordinate bonds, which are hygroscopic and vulnerable to water. The general water&#8208;induced plasticization facilitates the healing and reprocessing process but cause a troubling problem of random self&#8208;adhesion. To address this issue, here it is reported that by modifying the hygroscopic surfaces with hydrophobic alkyl chains of dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS), supramolecular plastic films based on commercial raw materials of sodium alginate (SA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) display extraordinary damage&#8208;specific healability. Owing to the hydrophobic surfaces, random self&#8208;adhesion is eliminated even under humid environment. When damage occurs, the fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose exclusively at the damaged site. Thus, damage&#8208;specific healing can be readily facilitated by water&#8208;induced plasticization. Moreover, the films display excellent room&#8208;temperature recyclability. After multiple times of reprocessing and re&#8208;modifying with DTMS, the rejuvenated films exhibit fatigueless mechanical properties. It is anticipated that this approach to damage&#8208;specific healing and room&#8208;temperature recycling based on surface hydrophobization can be applied to design various of supramolecular plastic polysaccharides materials for building sustainable societies.

         <title>Simple Visualization of Universal Ferroelastic Domain Walls in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic twin domain walls in lead halide perovskites are visualized using nonpolarized light and simple imaging configurations. These atomically thin domain walls become reflective at high angles and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. Ferroelasticity is found to be universal across lead halide perovskite phases and families, originating from their soft bonding characteristics.








Abstract
Domain features and domain walls in lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have attracted broad interest due to their potential impact on optoelectronic properties of this unique class of solution&#8208;processable semiconductors. Using nonpolarized light and simple imaging configurations, ferroelastic twin domains and their switchings through multiple consecutive phase transitions are directly visualized. This direct optical contrast originates from finite optical reflections at the wall interface between two compositionally identical, orientationally different, optically anisotropic domains inside the material bulk. The findings show these domain walls serve as internal reflectors and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. First&#8208;principles calculations show universal low domain&#8208;wall energies and modest energy barriers of domain switching, confirming their prevalent appearance, stable presence, and facile moving observed in the experiments. The generality of ferroelasticity in halide perovskites stems from their soft bonding characteristics. This work shows the feasibility of using LHP twin domain walls as optical guides of internal photoexcitations, capable of nonvolatile on&#8211;off switching and tunable positioning endowed by their universal ferroelasticity.

         <title>Tuning Surface Acidity of Mixed Conducting Electrodes: Recovery of Si&#8208;Induced Degradation of Oxygen Exchange Rate and Area Specific Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to counteract silica's deleterious impact on the oxygen reduction reaction, key to a wide range of applications, is demonstrated by neutralizing its induced surface acidity with basic Li&#8208; or Ca&#8208;additives. Si&#8208;surface impurities result in a nearly 4000&#8208;fold depression in the oxygen exchange coefficient, followed by 4&#8208;5 orders of magnitude recovery following calcia &#8208; and lithia surface infiltration, respectively.








Abstract
Metal oxides are an important class of functional materials, and for many applications, ranging from solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells, oxygen permeation membranes, and oxygen storage materials to gas sensors (semiconducting and electrolytic) and catalysts, the interaction between the surface and oxygen in the gas phase is central. Ubiquitous Si&#8208;impurities are known to impede this interaction, commonly attributed to the formation of glassy blocking layers on the surface. Here, the surface oxygen exchange coefficient (kchem) is examined for Pr0.1Ce0.9O2&#8208;&#948; (PCO), a model mixed ionic electronic conductor, via electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and the area&#8208;specific resistance (ASR) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that even low silica levels, introduced by infiltration, depress kchem by a factor 4000, while the ASR increases 40&#8208;fold and we&#160;attribute this to its acidity relative to that of PCO. The ability to fully regenerate the poisoned surface by the subsequent addition of basic Ca&#8208; or Li&#8208;species is further shown. This ability to not only recover Si&#8208;poisoned surfaces by tuning the relative surface acidity of an oxide surface, but subsequently outperform the pre&#8208;poisoned response, promises to extend the operating life of materials and devices for which the catalytic oxygen/solid interface reaction is central.

         <title>Polymer Solar Cells with Active Layer Thickness Compatible with Scalable Fabrication Processes: A Meta&#8208;Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers with high thickness are needed for the manufacture of organic solar devices using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#8208;compatible deposition techniques. On the other hand, high thickness values disfavor charge transport and, consequently, efficiency. Identifying the best compromise between thin and thick layers is essential to bring the organic photovoltaics technology to the market.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has been considered for a long time a promising emerging solar technology. Currently, however, market shares of OPV are practically non&#8208;existent. A detailed meta&#8208;analysis of the literature published until mid&#8208;2021 is presented, focusing on one of the remaining issues that need to be addressed to translate the recent remarkable progress, obtained in devices&#8217; performance at lab&#8208;scale level, into the requirements able to boost the manufacturing&#8208;scale production. Namely, the active layer's thickness is referred to, which, together with device efficiency and stability, represents one of the biggest challenges of this technological research field. Papers describing solar cells containing non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) binary and ternary blends, as well as NFA plus fullerene acceptor (FA) ternary blends are reviewed. The common ground of all analyzed devices is their high&#8208;thickness active layers, compatible with large&#8208;area deposition techniques. By defining a new figure of merit to discuss the OPV thickness (thickness tolerance, TT), it is found that this parameter is not affected by the chemical family's nature of the active blend components. On the other hand, the analysis suggests that there are promising strategies to improve the TT, which are discussed in the conclusion section.

         <title>Stable Cuprous Hydroxide Nanostructures by Organic Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) nanostructures are prepared for the first time by a facile wet chemistry route using acetylene and mercapto derivatives as the capping ligands. Due to the conjugated interfacial linkages with the acetylene moieties, the CuOH nanostructures exhibit a reduced bandgap, new optical/electronic properties, and hence enhance photodynamic activity toward the inhibition of bacterial growth.








Abstract
Copper compounds have been extensively investigated for diverse applications. However, studies of cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) have been scarce due to structural metastability. Herein, a facile, wet&#8208;chemistry procedure is reported for the preparation of stable CuOH nanostructures via deliberate functionalization with select organic ligands, such as acetylene and mercapto derivatives. The resulting nanostructures are found to exhibit a nanoribbon morphology consisting of small nanocrystals embedded within a largely amorphous nanosheet&#8208;like scaffold. The acetylene derivatives are found to anchor onto the CuOH forming Cu&#63743;C&#63741; linkages, whereas Cu&#63743;S&#63743; interfacial bonds are formed with the mercapto ligands. Effective electronic coupling occurs at the ligand&#8208;core interface in the former, in contrast to mostly non&#8208;conjugated interfacial bonds in the latter, as manifested in spectroscopic measurements and confirmed in theoretical studies based on first principles calculations. Notably, the acetylene&#8208;capped CuOH nanostructures exhibit markedly enhanced photodynamic activity in the inhibition of bacteria growth, as compared to the mercapto&#8208;capped counterparts due to a reduced material bandgap and effective photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Results from this study demonstrate that deliberate structural engineering with select organic ligands is an effective strategy in the stabilization and functionalization of CuOH nanostructures, a critical first step in exploring their diverse applications.

         <title>Stable Anode&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Tuned Metal Wetting on the Copper Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithiophilic Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency. An anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery employing a sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%.








Abstract
A stable anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (AF&#8208;ASSB) with sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (SE) (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) is achieved by tuning wetting of lithium metal on &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current&#8208;collector. Lithiophilic 1&#160;&#181;m Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation during the first charge. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency (CE). During continuous electrodeposition experiments using half&#8208;cells (1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), the accumulated thickness of electrodeposited Li on Li2Te&#8211;Cu is more than 70&#160;&#181;m, which is the thickness of the Li foil counter&#8208;electrode. Full AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%. Cryogenic focused ion beam (Cryo&#8208;FIB) sectioning demonstrates uniform electrodeposited metal microstructure, with no signs of voids or dendrites at the collector&#8208;SE interface. Electrodissolution is uniform and complete, with Li2Te remaining structurally stable and adherent. By contrast, an unmodified Cu current&#8208;collector promotes inhomogeneous Li electrodeposition/electrodissolution, electrochemically inactive &#8220;dead metal,&#8221; dendrites that extend into SE, and thick non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interspersed with pores. Density functional theory (DFT) and mesoscale calculations provide complementary insight regarding nucleation&#8208;growth behavior. Unlike conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte metal batteries, the role of current collector/support lithiophilicity has not been explored for emerging AF&#8208;ASSBs.

         <title>Identification of the Origin of Ultralow Dark Currents in Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark current in optimized organic donor&#8208;acceptor photodiodes is thermally activated with an energy lower than the effective bandgap and that corresponds to the minimum energy for optical charge generation as determined by photocurrent spectroscopy. This demonstrates that dark current is caused by thermal charge generation at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface and mediated by intra&#8208;gap states near the band edges.








Abstract
Organic bulk heterojunction photodiodes (OPDs) attract attention for sensing and imaging. Their detectivity is typically limited by a substantial reverse bias dark current density (Jd). Recently, using thermal admittance or spectral photocurrent measurements, Jd has been attributed to thermal charge generation mediated by mid&#8208;gap states. Here, the temperature dependence of Jd in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPDs is reported with Jd down to 10&#8722;9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V bias. For a variety of donor&#8208;acceptor bulk&#8208;heterojunction blends it is found that the thermal activation energy of Jd is lower than the effective bandgap of the blends, by ca. 0.3 to 0.5&#160;eV, but higher than expected for mid&#8208;gap states. Ultra&#8208;sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap photocurrent spectroscopy reveals that the minimum photon energy for optical charge generation in OPDs correlates with the dark current thermal activation energy. The dark current in OPDs is attributed to thermal charge generation at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface mediated by intra&#8208;gap states near the band edges.

         <title>Rationally Reconstructed Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Robust Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful fabrication of robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, through reconstruction of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) framework structure from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe type to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH type by means of an in situ coordination transformation of the active sites, is reported. The resulting eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting of the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in the MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is so small as to guarantee the efficient OER with lowered overpotential at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Reconstructing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs) toward a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet. Here, the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure is reported, viz., from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites. Due to the radically reduced eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting in Fe&#8208;3d and the much suppressed electron&#8208;hopping barriers through the synergistic effects of the O species the efficient OER of in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is guaranteed. Benefiting from this desired electronic structure, the designed MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH catalyst exhibits high intrinsic OER activity, including a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec&#8722;1 and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.44 s&#8722;1 at 300 mV overpotential, over 80 times that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (0.0177 s&#8722;1).Consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the real&#8208;time kinetic simulation reveals that the conversion from O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step on the active sites of MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH.

         <title>A BF3&#8208;Doped MXene Dual&#8208;Layer Interphase for a Reliable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer interphase consisting of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2&#160;MXene is formed on the surface of Li&#8208;metal. The functional BF3&#160;groups along with MXene lead to a homogenous lithium deposition. The battery with the dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode shows improved electrochemical property and battery capacity retention.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;layer interphase that consists of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene on Li metal is reported. The honeycomb&#8208;structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3&#8208;doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic&#8208;rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30&#160;mV over 1000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells is received. The functional BF3&#160;groups, along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene, greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal anode. The battery with this dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode displays greatly improved electrochemical performance. A high capacity&#8208;retention of 175.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#160;C is achieved after 350&#160;cycles. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475&#160;mAh, the battery still exhibits a high discharge capacity of 165.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200&#160;cycles. In contrast to the fast capacity decay of pure Li metal, the battery using NCA as the cathode also displays excellent capacity retention in both coin and pouch cells. The dual&#8208;layer modified surface provides an effective approach in stabilizing the Li&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Polyimine Aerogels Derived from Bio&#8208;Based Resources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and comprehensive characterization of closed&#8208;loop recyclable organic aerogels is presented. These polyimine aerogels (PIAs) are made from phosphorus&#8208;rich precursors derived from bio&#8208;based resources. The PIAs display superinsulating ability, great thermal stability, and good flame retardancy. More importantly, the simple recycling protocol allows to depolymerize PIAs on demand and recover the original monomers in high purity.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an intriguing class of highly porous and ultralight materials which have found widespread applications in thermal insulation, energy storage, and chemical absorption. These fully cross&#8208;linked polymeric networks, however, pose environmental concerns as they are typically made from fossil&#8208;based feedstock and the recycling back to their original monomers is virtually impossible. In addition, organic aerogels suffer from low thermal stability and potential fire hazard. To overcome these obstacles and create next&#8208;generation organic aerogels, a set of polyimine aerogels containing reversible chemical bonds which can selectively be cleaved on demand is prepared. As precursors, different primary amines and cyclophosphazene derivatives made from bio&#8208;based reagents (vanillin and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde) to elevate the thermal stability and reduce the environmental impact are used. The resulting polyimine aerogels exhibit low shrinkage, high porosity, large surface area, as well as pronounced thermal stability and flame resistance. More importantly, the aerogels show excellent recyclability under acidic conditions with high monomer recovery yields and purities. This approach allows for preparation of fresh aerogels from the retrieved building blocks, thus demonstrating efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling. These high&#8208;performance, recyclable, and bio&#8208;based polyimine aerogels pave the way for advanced and sustainable superinsulating materials.

         <title>Physical Origin of Negative Differential Resistance in V3O5 and Its Application as a Solid&#8208;State Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of V3O5 and its application as a functional oxide layer in volatile memristive switching devices are reported, with a particular focus on the devlopment of oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillators as artificial neurons in hardware&#8208;based neural networks. 








Abstract
Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8211;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy&#8208;efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware&#8208;based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of V3O5 thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal/oxide/metal relaxation oscillators are reported. The V3O5 devices show electroforming&#8208;free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&lt;3% variation) cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in situ thermal imaging, and device modeling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self&#8208;confinement of the current distribution and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the insulator&#8211;metal transition temperature where it is dominated by the temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, the dynamics of individual and coupled V3O5&#8208;based relaxation oscillators is reported, showing that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non&#8208;linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronization. These results establish V3O5 as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid&#8208;state neurons for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are realized by the development of a single atom vanadium anchored on 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (3D&#8208;PNCV) as an ideal host in RT Na&#8211;S chemistry. Such host possesses the advantages of the abundant micro/mesoporous, highly reactive V single atom, which can restrain the polysulfides dissolution and in time catalyze the conversion of polysulfide into solid discharged products.








Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfide conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, single&#8208;atom vanadium anchored on a 3D&#160;nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8211;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8211;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

Pure&#8208;red PeLEDs based on CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs that simultaneously offer high brightness and high efficiency are demonstrated via reducing self&#8208;doping effect, suppressing phase separation, and passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ related defects by using a multifunctional &#8220;halide&#8208;equivalent&#8221; benzenesulfonate anion passivation technique. The pure&#8208;red PeLEDs exhibit a high brightness of 1510&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a peak external quantum efficiency of 23.5%, and decent electroluminescence spectral stability.








Abstract
Pure&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) based on CsPb(Br/I)3 nanocrystals (NCs) usually suffer from a compromise in emission efficiency and spectral stability on account of the surface halide vacancies&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination loss, halide phase segregation, and self&#8208;doping effect. Herein, a &#8220;halide&#8208;equivalent&#8221; anion of benzenesulfonate (BS&#8211;) is introduced into CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs as multifunctional additive to simultaneously address the above challenging issues. Joint experiment&#8208;theory characterizations reveal that the BS&#8211; can not only passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+&#8208;related defects at the surface of NCs, but also increase the formation energy of halide vacancies. Moreover, because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property of sulfonate group, electrons are expected to transfer from the CsPb(Br/I)3 NC to BS&#8211; for reducing the self&#8208;doping effect and altering the n&#8208;type behavior of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs to near ambipolarity. Eventually, synergistic boost in device performance is achieved for pure&#8208;red PeLEDs with CIE coordinates of (0.70, 0.30) and a champion external quantum efficiency of 23.5%, which is one of the best value among the ever&#8208;reported red PeLEDs approaching to the Rec. 2020 red primary color. Moreover, the BS&#8211;&#8208;modified PeLED exhibits negligible wavelength shift under different operating voltages. This strategy paves an efficient way for improving the efficiency and stability of pure&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite Nanocrystal Ink for High&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional CsPbI3&#160;perovskite nanocrystal ink is developed through solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange with 3,3&#8208;diphenylpropylammonium iodide, attributed to singular stabilization by diphenyl group and rigorous surface passivation. This enables a &#8220;universal&#8221; demonstration of high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and light&#8208;emitting devices while ensuring excellent phase stability and device longevity.








Abstract
Semiconducting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices due to their solution processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. While the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PVs), two prime examples of optoelectronic devices, has recently seen a multitude of efforts toward high&#8208;performance PNC&#8208;based devices, realizing both devices with high efficiencies and stabilities through a single PNC processing strategy has remained a challenge. &#160;In this work, diphenylpropylammonium (DPAI) surface ligands, found through a judicious ab&#8208;initio&#8208;based ligand search, are shown to provide a solution to this problem. The universal PNC ink with DPAI ligands presented here, prepared through a solution&#8208;phase ligand&#8208;exchange process, simultaneously allows single&#8208;step processed LED and PV devices with peak electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 17.00% and power conversion efficiency of 14.92% (stabilized output 14.00%), respectively. It is revealed that a careful design of the aromatic rings such as in DPAI is the decisive factor in bestowing such high performances, ease of solution processing, and improved phase stability up to 120&#160;days. This work illustrates the power of ligand design in producing PNC ink formulations for high&#8208;throughput production of optoelectronic devices; it also paves a path for &#8220;dual&#8208;mode&#8221; devices with both PV and LED functionalities.

         <title>Unconventional Spin State Driven Spontaneous Magnetization in a Praseodymium Iron Antimonide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonide Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization when cooled without external magnetic field, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. Below 40&#160;K, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. The spin structure is studied by magnetic measurements, spectroscopy, and diffraction.








Abstract
Consolidating a microscopic understanding of magnetic properties is crucial for a rational design of magnetic materials with tailored characteristics. The interplay of 3d and 4f magnetism in rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonides is an ideal platform to search for such complex behavior. Here the synthesis, crystal growth, structure, and complex magnetic properties are reported of the new compound Pr3Fe3Sb7 as studied by magnetization and electrical transport measurements in static and pulsed magnetic fields up to 56&#160;T, powder neutron diffraction, and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. On cooling without external magnetic field, Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. The Fe substructure exhibits noncollinear ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature TC&#160;&#8776;&#160;380 K. Two spin orientations exist, which approximately align along the Fe&#8211;Fe bond directions, one parallel to the ab plane and a second one with the moments canting away from the c axis. The Pr substructure orders below 40&#160;K, leading to a spin&#8208;reorientation transition (SRT) of the iron substructure. In low fields, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. At 1.4&#160;K, the magnetization approaches saturation above 40&#160;T. The compound exhibits metallic resistivity along the c axis, with a small anomaly at the SRT.

On cooling without external magnetic field, Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; shows spontaneous magnetization, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. The Fe substructure exhibits noncollinear ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776;&#160;380 K. Two spin orientations exist, which approximately align along the Fe&#8211;Fe bond directions, one parallel to the &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; plane and a second one with the moments canting away from the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis. The Pr substructure orders below 40&#160;K, leading to a spin-reorientation transition (SRT) of the iron substructure. In low fields, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. At 1.4&#160;K, the magnetization approaches saturation above 40&#160;T. The compound exhibits metallic resistivity along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis, with a small anomaly at the SRT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photomagnetically Powered Spiky Nanomachines with Thermal Control of Viscosity for Enhanced Cancer Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pronged driving strategy of nanomachines by simultaneously enhancing magnetic forces and reducing viscous forces is proposed here. The photomagnetically powered nanomachines with spiky surface exhibit a thermally dependent viscosity tunability and coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic perception, which facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for enhanced cancer mechanotherapy. This work shines a light on designing intelligent nanomachine&#8208;based mechanotherapy for clinical translation.








Abstract
Nanomachines with active propulsion have emerged as an intelligent platform for targeted cancer therapy. Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, a photomagnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermally dependent viscosity tunability is proposed to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine is integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. Physical simulations and experimental results prove that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photomagnetic coupling effect in the NIR&#8208;II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain&#8208;like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity are efficiently propelled under simultaneously applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photomagnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.

         <title>m6A Reader YTHDF1&#8208;Targeting Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Cancer Therapy via Epigenetic and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1)&#8208;targeting engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) inhibit gastric tumor progression and metastasis through epigenetic and immune regulation. The engineered sEVs hamper frizzled7 translation and inactivate Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner, and promote immunotherapy by direct self&#8208;presentation of immunogenic tumor and CD47&#160;blockade&#8208;based immunosuppression reversal.








Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modulators decide the fate of m6A&#8208;modified transcripts and drive cancer development. RNA interference targeting m6A modulators promise to be an emerging cancer therapy but is challenging due to its poor tumor targeting and high systematic toxicity. Here engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with high CD47&#160;expression and cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic (c(RGDyC)) modification are developed for effective delivery of short interfering RNA against m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) to treat gastric cancer via epigenetic and immune regulation. This nanosystem efficiently depletes YTHDF1&#160;expression and suppresses gastric cancer progression and metastasis through hampering frizzled7 translation and inactivating Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner. Loss of YTHDF1&#160;mediates overexpression of interferon (IFN)&#8208;&#947; receptor 1 and enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; response, promoting expression of major histocompatibility complex class I on tumor cells to achieve self&#8208;presentation of the immunogenic tumor cells to stimulate strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses. CD47&#160;expression on the engineered sEVs can competitively bind with signal regulatory protein &#945; to enhance phagocytosis of the tumor cells by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages. This versatile nanoplatform provides an efficient and low toxic strategy to inhibit epigenetic regulators and holds great potential in promoting immunotherapy.

         <title>Flash Recycling of Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spent graphite anodes can be regenerated by an ultrafast flash recycling method. The valuable battery metals can be easily recovered from the flashed anode products by a 0.1 m HCl post&#8208;treatment. The flash&#8208;recycled anode shows recovered electrochemical performance Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;analysis highlights that flash recycling can significantly reduce total energy and greenhouse gas emissions while turning it into an economically advantageous process.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing production of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life. A closed&#8208;loop solution, with effective recycling of spent LIBs, will lessen both the environmental impacts and economic cost of their use. Presently, &lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery&#8208;grade graphite. Here, an ultrafast flash recycling method to regenerate the graphite anode is developed and valuable battery metal resources are recovered. Selective Joule heating is applied for only seconds to efficiently decompose the resistive impurities. The generated inorganic salts, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, can be easily recollected from the flashed anode waste using diluted acid, specifically 0.1&#160;m HCl. The flash&#8208;recycled anode preserves the graphite structure and is coated with a solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase&#8208;derived carbon shell, contributing to high initial specific capacity, superior rate performance, and cycling stability, when compared to anode materials recycled using a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;calcination method. Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;analysis relative to current graphite production and recycling methods indicate that flash recycling can significantly reduce the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission while turning anode recycling into an economically advantageous process.

         <title>Tuning the C1/C2 Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8211;CeO2 Nanorods by Oxidation State Control</title>

The tunable CH4/C2H4 selectivity of Cu&#8211;CeO2 nanorods during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by precisely controlling the structure and valence state of the Cu active sites on CeO2 nanorods is reported. The coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters on ceria nanorods lowers the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons.








Ceria (CeO2) is one of the most extensively used rare earth oxides. Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO2 interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, a Cu&#8211;CeO2 nanorod electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst is presented. Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu&#8211;ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27&#160;times that of a corresponding Cu&#8208;carbon catalyst under the same conditions.

Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to (Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;,Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; products as the main product during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, the coexistence of (Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;,Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling and enables the selective production of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;,Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the clusters at the Cu&#8211;ceria interface results in a C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density/unit Cu weight 27&#160;times that of a corresponding Cu-carbon catalyst under the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Thermomechanically Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on a shape&#8208;memory polymer and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque.








Abstract
Future active metamaterials for reconfigurable structural applications require fast, untethered, reversible, and reprogrammable (multimodal) transformability with shape locking. Magnetic control has a superior advantage for fast and remotely controlled deployment; however, a significant drawback is needed to maintain the magnetic force to hold the transformation, limiting its use in structural applications. The shape&#8208;locking property of shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) can resolve this issue. However, the intrinsic irreversibility of SMPs may limit their reconfigurability as active metamaterials. Moreover, to date, reprogrammable methods have required high power with laser and arc welding proving to be energy&#8208;inefficient control methods. In this work, a magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on the SMP and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque. The mutual assistance of two physics concepts&#8212;magnetic control combined with the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs&#160;is demonstrated, without requiring new materials synthesis and high&#8208;power energy for reprogramming. This approach can open a new path of active metamaterials, flexible yet stiff soft robots, multimodal morphing structures, and mechanical computing devices where it can be designed in reversible and reprogrammable ways.

         <title>Significant Zero Thermal Expansion Via Enhanced Magnetoelastic Coupling in Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero thermal expansion&#160;(ZTE) with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av of 2.4 ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range is achieved owing to the significant contribution of interstitial C into a Hf&#8211;Ta&#8211;Fe magnet. The corresponding mechanism of tuning normal positive thermal expansion into intriguingly ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling during magnetic transition is clarified by comprehensive property measurements, direct observation of magnetic transition, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (ZTE) alloys, as dimensionally stable materials, are urgently required in many fields, particularly in highly advanced modern industries. In this study, high&#8208;performance ZTE with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av as small as 2.4&#160;ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range of 85&#8211;245 K is discovered in Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2C0.01 magnet. It is demonstrated that the addition of trace interstitial atom C into Ta&#8208;substituted Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2 exhibits significant capability to tune the normal positive thermal expansion&#160;into high&#8208;performance ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling in stabilized ferromagnetic structure. Moreover, direct observation of the magnetic transition between ferromagnetic and triangular antiferromagnetic states via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, along with corresponding theoretical calculations, further uncovers the manipulation mechanism of ZTE and negative thermal expansion. A convenient and effective method to optimize thermal expansion and achieve ZTE with interstitial C addition may result in broadened applications based on the strong correlation between the magnetic properties and crystal structure.

         <title>Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum Dots 3D Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot superlattices hold promise to combine tunable optical properties with electrical transport comparable to bulk semiconductors. In this work, it is demonstrated that the self&#8208;assembly of highly ordered 3D superlattices made from PbSe colloidal quantum dots achieves record electron mobilities up to 278 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, the highest for these systems and for any self&#8208;assembled solid of quantum&#8208;confined objects.








Abstract
3D superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was&#160;performed on 2D arrays, the control over the formation of these systems is lacking, where limited long&#8208;range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here, it is reported that nanoscale&#8208;level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in 3D and over large areas allows the achievement of outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self&#8208;assembled solid of fully quantum&#8208;confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching that of bulk semiconductor can be obtained. This finding paves the way toward a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Ultra&#8208;Robust MoS2 Patterns Directly Synthesized on Polymer Substrate for Flexible Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining inkjet printing and thermal annealing, large&#8208;area patterned MoS2 are directly synthesized on polymer substrates without photolithography patterning and transferring process. The resultant MoS2 films exhibit superior mechanical durability (&#8776;2% variation in resistance over 10,000 bending cycles), as well as excellent chemical stability. Also, temperature and biopotential signals are continuously recorded with MoS2&#8208;based sensors even under folding conditions.








Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;area patterned MoS2 is considered the principle base for realizing high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based flexible electronic devices. Patterning and transferring MoS2 films to target flexible substrates, however, require conventional multi&#8208;step photolithography patterning and transferring process, despite tremendous progress in the facilitation of practical applications. Herein, an approach to directly synthesize large&#8208;scale MoS2 patterns that combines inkjet printing and thermal annealing is reported. An optimal precursor ink is prepared that can deposit arbitrary patterns on polyimide films. By introducing a gas atmosphere of argon/hydrogen (Ar/H2), thermal treatment at 350&#160;&#176;C enables an in situ decomposition and crystallization in the patterned precursors and, consequently, results in the formation of MoS2. Without complicated processes, patterned MoS2 is obtained directly on polymer substrate, exhibiting superior mechanical flexibility and durability (&#8776;2% variation in resistance over 10,000 bending cycles), as well as excellent chemical stability, which is attributed to the generated continuous and thin microstructures, as well as their strong adhesion with the substrate. As a step further, this approach is employed to manufacture various flexible sensing devices that are insensitive to body motions and moisture, including temperature sensors and biopotential sensing systems for real&#8208;time, continuously monitoring skin temperature, electrocardiography, and electromyography signals.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructure with Interferon Stimulatory DNA Delivers Highly Potent Toxins and Activates the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Robust Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The encapsulation of the chemotherapeutic platinum(II) complex 56MESS into tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs), which have been modified with immunogenic interferon stimulatory DNA strands for activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway to form a nanoformulation (84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS), is reported. 84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS is able to therapeutically intervene against primary and secondary/metastatic tumors by multimodal combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor metastases and reoccurrences are considered the leading cause of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While highly efficient treatments for the eradication of primary tumors have been developed, the treatment of secondary or metastatic tumors remains poorly accessible. Over the past years, compounds that intervene through the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes&#160;(cGAS&#8208;STING) signaling pathway against tumor metastases have emerged with&#160;potential for clinical development. While interferon stimulatory DNAs have demonstrated activation of this pathway, these compounds are associated with poor bioavailability, poor stability, and poor cancer selectivity, hindering their use for therapeutic applications. Herein, the encapsulation of a highly potent chemotherapeutic platinum(II) complex and the incorporation of interferon stimulatory DNA strands for activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway into multimodal tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS) for combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy is reported. It is found that 84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS can work as not only a drug delivery carrier for highly potent toxins, but also an immunostimulant agent that can activate the STING pathway for antitumor immune responses. In a mouse breast cancer model, the DNA nanostructure is found to nearly&#160;fully eradicate primary as well as secondary/metastatic tumors, hence demonstrating its potential clinical translational value.

         <title>Suppressing the Dynamic Oxygen Evolution of Sodium Layered Cathodes through Synergistic Surface Dielectric Polarization and Bulk Site&#8208;Selective Co&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic oxygen evolution process from the surface to the bulk of sodium layered cathodes is effectively suppressed through synergistic surface dielectric polarization and bulk site&#8208;selective co&#8208;doping, which results in reversible structural evolution with low volume change because of the enhanced structural integrality and improved oxygen rigidity, leading to stable cationic and anionic redox chemistry over cycling.








Abstract
Utilizing anionic redox activity within layered oxide cathode materials represents a transformational avenue for enabling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the anionic oxygen redox reaction is often accompanied with irreversible dynamic oxygen evolution, leading to unfavorable structural distortion and thus severe voltage decay and rapid capacity fading. Herein, it is proposed and validated that the dynamic oxygen evolution can be effectively suppressed through the synergistic surface CaTiO3 dielectric coating and bulk site&#8208;selective Ca/Ti co&#8208;doping for layered Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. The surface dielectric coating layer not only suppresses the surface oxygen release but more importantly inhibits the bulk oxygen migration by creating a reverse electric field through dielectric polarization. Meanwhile, the site&#8208;selective doping of oxygen&#8208;affinity Ca into Na layers and Ti into transition metal layers effectively stabilizes the bulk oxygen through modulating the O 2p band center and the oxygen migration barrier. Such a strategy also leads to a reversible structural evolution with a low volume change because of the enhanced structural integrality and improved oxygen rigidity. Because of these synergistic advantages, the designed electrode exhibits greatly suppressed voltage decay and capacity fading upon long&#8208;term cycling. This study affords a promising strategy for regulating the dynamic oxygen evolution to achieve high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Design of the Metal&#8211;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(M)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be tuned along a time axis by adjusting the ratio of nickel and cobalt in the paddle wheel node. Advanced in&#160;situ methodologies reveal switching rates ranging from 1 to 200 s. Individual crystal observations in a microfluidic device reveal prolonged induction time in particular for highly cobalt substituted frameworks.








Abstract
Switchable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) change their structure in time and selectively open their pores adsorbing guest molecules, leading to highly selective separation, pressure amplification, sensing, and actuation applications. The 3D engineering of MOFs has reached a high level of maturity, but spatiotemporal evolution opens a new perspective toward engineering materials in the 4th dimension (time) by t&#8208;axis design, in essence exploiting the deliberate tuning of activation barriers. This work demonstrates the first example in which an explicit temporal engineering of a switchable MOF (DUT&#8208;8, [M1M2(2,6&#8208;ndc)2dabco]n, 2,6&#8208;ndc = 2,6&#8208;naphthalene dicarboxylate, dabco = 1,4diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, M1&#160;= Ni, M2&#160;= Co) is presented. The temporal response is deliberately tuned by variations in cobalt content. A spectrum of advanced analytical methods is presented for analyzing the switching kinetics stimulated by vapor adsorption using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved techniques ranging from ensemble adsorption and advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments to individual crystal analysis. A novel analysis technique based on microscopic observation of individual crystals in a microfluidic channel reveals the lowest limit for adsorption switching reported so far. Differences in the spatiotemporal response of crystal ensembles originate from an induction time that varies statistically and widens characteristically with increasing cobalt content reflecting increasing activation barriers.

Organic Transistors
In article number 2210093, Yan Zhao, Yang Wang, Yunqi Liu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy to synthesize an acceptor unit with a fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture (DPP&#8211;difluorobenzothiadiazole&#8211;DPP (DFB)). The DFB&#8208;based semiconducting polymers feature low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, shape&#8208;persistent backbones, and high crystallinity, leading to an electron mobility of up to 5.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in unipolar n&#8208;type transistors, which is the highest electron mobility among DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type polymers.

Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
In article number 2208996, Pyuck&#8208;Pa Choi, Stefan Ringe, Jihun Oh, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of Cu&#8211;ceria&#8208;nanorod catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The ceria nanorods help CuO exist as several cluster layers at the interface. Through the strong metal&#8211;support interaction between Cu and ceria, Cu can be stably loaded on ceria nanorods in a mixed oxidation state at the Cu/ceria interface, which facilitates CO&#8211;CO dimerization, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency selective ethylene production.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors
In article number 2209097, Yunlong Guo, Huanli Dong, Yunqi Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop a highly efficient van der Waals multilayer heterojunction by balancing the van der Waals interaction and energy level matching of various organic layers. Benefiting from the enhancement of layer&#8208;to&#8208;layer interaction and interfacial contact, the first organic light&#8208;emitting transistor array is realized, which sufficiently meets the low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost requirements of future display technologies.

Magnetoelectric Coupling
In article number 2207353, Chen Ge, Qiang Li, and co&#8208;workers propose a space&#8208;charge mechanism, through decoupling the transport of ions and electrons, to achieve magnetoelectric coupling in ferromagnetic&#8208;metal films. This method combines the advantages of both carrier doping and chemical reaction mechanisms, which allows for an efficient modulation with both large&#8208;magnitude and robust endurance.

In article number 2206762, Yijie Liu, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report a stable anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (AF&#8208;ASSB) with a sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl). The battery is achieved by tuning the wetting of lithium metal on the &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current&#8208;collector. In the cover image, the sprinting antelope represent the lithium cations rapidly diffusing through the solid&#8208;state sulfide electrolyte with the blood&#8208;red sunset behind them. The still water underneath represents the smooth lithium&#8208;metal anode, while the mountains represent the dendrites, which the antelope avoid.

Printing and Annealing
In article number 2207447, Weiwei Li, Manzhang Xu, Jiuwei Gao, Xuewen Wang, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how MoS2 patterns can be directly synthesized on polymer substrates using a printing&#8208;and&#8208;annealing strategy.

         <title>Collective Behaviors of Active Matter Learning from Natural Taxes Across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 8, February 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and synthetic agents perform collective taxes based on the local taxis between neighbors and global taxis toward various stimuli. Microorganisms and microrobots perform collective taxes in forms of one&#8208;way transformation, reversible generation, high&#8208;order system, and hierarchical system. Synthetic or biohybrid collectives conduct on&#8208;demand functionalities in environmental and biomedical engineering toward clinical trials owing to the efficiency, robustness, and adaptivity.








Abstract
Taxis orientation is common in microorganisms, and it provides feasible strategies to operate active colloids as small&#8208;scale robots. Collective taxes involve numerous units that collectively perform taxis motion, whereby the collective cooperation between individuals enables the group to perform efficiently, adaptively, and robustly. Hence, analyzing and designing collectives is crucial for developing and advancing microswarm toward practical or clinical applications. In this review, natural taxis behaviors are categorized and synthetic microrobotic collectives are discussed as bio&#8208;inspired realizations, aiming at closing the gap between taxis strategies of living creatures and those of functional active microswarms. As collective behaviors emerge within a group, the global taxis to external stimuli guides the group to conduct overall tasks, whereas the local taxis between individuals induces synchronization and global patterns. By encoding the local orientations and programming the global stimuli, various paradigms can be introduced for coordinating and controlling such collective microrobots, from the viewpoints of fundamental science and practical applications. Therefore, by discussing the key points and difficulties associated with collective taxes of different paradigms, this review potentially offers insights into mimicking natural collective behaviors and constructing intelligent microrobotic systems for on&#8208;demand control and preassigned&#160;tasks.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulated Two&#8208;Dimensional ReSe2: A Universal Platform Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar hydrogen (H2) generation via photocatalytic water splitting is practically promising, environmentally&#8208;benign and sustainably carbon&#8208;neutral. It is important therefore to understand how to controllably engineer photocatalysts at the atomic level. In this work we report atomic&#8208;level engineering of defected ReSe2 nanosheets (NSs) to significantly boost photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductor photocatalysts including TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4 and C3N4. Advanced characterizations, such as atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy and transient&#8208;state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe2/TiO2 interface and substantial atomic&#8208;level active sites of defected ReSe2 NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe2/TiO2. Our work not only for the first time realizes the atomic&#8208;level engineering of ReSe2 NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic&#8208;level synthesis and exploration on two dimensional materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Circulatory Support: Artificial Muscles for the Future of Cardiovascular Assist Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial muscles enable the design of soft implantable devices which are poised to transform the way we&#160;mechanically support the heart today. Heart failure is a prevalent and deadly disease, which is treated with the implantation of rotary blood pumps as the only alternative to heart transplantation. The clinically used mechanical devices are associated with severe adverse events, which are reflected here in a comprehensive list of critical requirements for soft active devices of the future: low power, no blood contact, pulsatile support, physiological responsiveness, high cycle life, and less&#8208;invasive implantation. In this review, we&#160;investigate and critically evaluate prior art in artificial muscles for their applicability in the short and long term. We&#160;highlight the main challenges regarding the effectiveness, controllability, and implantability of recently proposed actuators and explore future perspectives for attachment, physiological responsiveness, durability, and biodegradability as well as equitable design considerations.

         <title>Interfacing Biology and Electronics with Memristive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memristive technologies promise to have a large impact on modern electronics, particularly in the areas of reconfigurable computing and AI hardware. Meanwhile, the evolution of memristive materials alongside the technological progress is opening application perspectives also in the biomedical field, particularly for implantable and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices where advanced sensing technologies generate a large amount of data. Memristive devices are emerging as bioelectronic links merging biosensing with computation, acting as physical processors of analogue signals or in the framework of advanced digital computing architectures. We review recent developments on the processing of electrical neural signals, as well as on transduction and processing of chemical biomarkers of neural and endocrine functions. We conclude with a critical perspective on the future applicability of memristive devices as pivotal building blocks in Bio&#8208;AI fusion concepts and bionic schemes.

         <title>A Review on Regulating Li+ Solvation Structures in Carbonate Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is highly influenced by the solvation structure of Li+. A comprehensive overview of strategies is presented for regulating the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes to improve Li+ behavior and the performance of LMBs. The remaining questions and perspectives for advanced carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are also outlined.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. Different strategies are systematically compared to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. The remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <title>Breaking the Photostability and pH Limitation of Halo&#8208;Fluoresceins through Chitosan Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are famous for various applications, such as photoredox synthesis, photodynamic therapy, and sensing and imaging, but suffer from notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence, which limit their applications in long&#8208;term light exposure and acidic environments. Herein, a chitosan conjugation strategy is proposed for significantly increasing the anti&#8208;photobleaching activity and pH inertness of halo&#8208;fluoresceins, endowing these old dyes&#160;with&#160;new&#160;vitality.&#160;








Abstract
Halo&#8208;fluoresceins are widely used in cell and tissue staining, intracellular sensing, and photodynamic therapy, but their notorious photo&#8208;instability and pH dependence restrict their applications, especially in long&#8208;term visible light exposure and acidic environments. To overcome these limitations, here a strategy is proposed of conjugating chitosan with the carboxyl group of halo&#8208;fluorescein (CS&#8208;halofluorescein). The cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of chitosan help shielding out 1O2 from direct attacking the encapsulated halo&#8208;fluoresceins, leading to a&#160;two orders of magnitude lower photobleaching rate. Meanwhile, the condensation of primary amines of chitosan with the carboxyl group on halo&#8208;fluorescein blocks the pH&#8208;dependent intramolecular spirocyclization, leading to pH&#8208;inert fluorescein derivatives. The greatly improved photostability and pH inertness of CS&#8208;halofluoresceins can be harvested for aerobic photoredox synthesis and photodynamic bacteria inactivation in extremely acidic media. Moreover, food additive nature of chitosan and erythrosine (TIF) and excellent film&#8208;forming property of chitosan allow coating&#8208;based light&#8208;assisted preservation of perishable fruits, leading to appreciably extended shelf life of fruits (e.g., perishable strawberry, rt: &gt; 3 days; 4&#160;&#176;C: &gt; 5 days).

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, corroles, benzoannulenes, crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, calixarenes, or pillararenes can be installed on covalent organic frameworks to make macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for applications such as single&#8208;atom catalyst, adsorption, electronics, photodynamic therapy, and single&#8208;layer design.








Abstract
Macrocycles with well&#8208;defined cavities and the ability to undergo supramolecular interactions are classical materials that have played an essential role in materials science. However, one of the most substantial barriers limiting the utilization of macrocycles is their aggregation, which blocks the active regions. Among many attempted strategies to prevent such aggregation, installing macrocycles into covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are porous and stable reticular networks, has emerged as an ideal solution. The resulting macrocycle&#8208;based COFs (M&#8208;COFs) preserve the macrocycles&#8217; unique activities, enabling applications in various fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, adsorption/separation, optoelectronics, phototherapy, and structural design of forming single&#8208;layered or mechanically interlocked COFs. The resulting properties are unmatchable by any combination of macrocycles with other substrates, opening a new chapter in advanced materials. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, properties, and applications of M&#8208;COFs, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Pure Red TADF Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF emitter tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx is designed and synthesized to enable highly efficient pure red emitting solution&#8208;processed OLEDs. Relying on its small &#916;EST of 0.07&#160;eV, high PLQY of 92%, and high KRISC of 3.98&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx exhibit a high EQE of 16.7% at 662&#160;nm with CIE coordinates of (0.67, 0.32).








Abstract
In spite of recent research progress in red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, highly efficient solution&#8208;processable pure red TADF emitters are rarely reported. Most of the red TADF emitters reported to date are designed using a rigid acceptor unit which renders them insoluble and unsuitable for solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To resolve this issue, a novel TADF emitter, 6,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx) is designed and synthesized. The highly twisted donor&#8208;acceptor architecture and appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distribution lead to a very small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.07&#160;eV, high photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%, and short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 52.4&#160;&#181;s. The peripheral t&#8208;butyl phenyl decorated quinoxaline acceptor unit and t&#8208;butyl protected triphenylamine donor unit are proven to be useful building blocks to improve solubility and minimize the intermolecular interaction. The solution&#8208;processed OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.7% with a pure red emission peak at 662 nm, which is one of the highest EQE values reported till date in the solution&#8208;processed pure red TADF OLEDs. Additionally, vacuum&#8208;processable OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx exhibits a high EQE of 22.2% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Unlock Restricted Capacity via O&#63743;Ce Hybridization for Li&#63743;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the reported surface&#8208;mediated Li2O2 with limited film thickness of t&#160;&lt; 50&#160;nm, a submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shell with t&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm can be grown onto a high&#8208;energy faceted CeO2&#8208;&#948; catalyst, which induces an orbital hybridized electronic structure via electrochemical activations, unlocking the rechargeable capacities of Li&#8208;O2 batteries from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#8201;000 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
The aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) has the highest theoretical energy density of any rechargeable batteries. However, such system is largely restricted by the electrochemically formed lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface, leading ultimately to low actual capacities and early cell death. In contrast to the surface&#8208;mediated growth of thin film with a thickness &lt;50&#160;nm, a non&#8208;crystalline Li2O2 film with a thickness of &gt;400&#160;nm can be formed via an optimal O&#63743;Ce hybridized electronic structure. Specially, oxygen can react with dissolved cerium cations in the electrolyte via a cerium&#8208;oxygen reaction to form a high&#8208;energy faceted cerium oxide catalyst, which not only generates a great number of non&#8208;saturable active sites, but also erects electron transport bridges between the lattice O and adjacent Ce atoms. Such Ce&#63743;O orbital hybridization&#160;also forms a direct charge transfer channel from Ce&#63743;&#8208;4f of CeO2 to O22&#8722;${\rm{O}}_2^{2 - }$&#8208;&#960;* of Li2O2, eventually leading to submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shells via a subsequent lithium&#8208;oxygen reaction. Relying on the above merits, this work unlocks the rechargeable capacities of LOB from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#160;000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with good cyclabilities and reduced charge&#8211;discharge overpotentials.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Rich Interface for a Highly Stable and Safe 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generation of phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed by reasonable design of the&#160;electrolyte, which can stabilize the LiCoO2&#160;(LCO) by decreasing the generation of cracks and suppressing the degradation of interface.

Increasing the upper cut&#8208;off voltage of LiCoO2 (LCO) is one of the most efficient strategies to gain high&#8208;energy density for current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, surface instability is expected to be exaggerated with increasing voltage arising from the high reactivity between the delithiated LCO and electrolytes, leading to serious safety concerns. This work is aimed to construct a physically and chemically stable phosphate&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) on the LCO particles to mitigate this issue. This phosphate&#8208;rich CEI is generated during the electrochemical activation by using fluoroethylene carbonate and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyletherare as the solvents. Both solvents also demonstrate high thermal stability, reducing the intrinsic flammability of the commercial organic electrolyte, thereby eliminating the safety concern in the LCO&#8208;based systems upon high&#8208;voltage operation. This stable CEI layer on the particle surface can also enhance the surface structure by blocking direct contact between LCO and electrolyte, improving the cycling stability. Therefore, by using the proposed electrolyte, the LCO cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 76.1% after 200 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. This work provides a novel insight into the rational design of high&#8208;voltage and safe battery systems by adopting the flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;The in situ generation of phosphate-rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed by reasonable design of the&#160;electrolyte, which can stabilize the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(LCO) by decreasing the generation of cracks and suppressing the degradation of interface. Besides, it improves the flame-retardancy of electrolyte and guarantees the safety issues of high-voltage LCO.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Conversion of Silicon Nitride Nanopore to Nanonet for Single Protein Trapping Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule technique for investigation of an unlabeled protein in solution is very attractive but with great challenges. Nanopore sensing as a label&#8208;free tool can be used for collecting the structural information of individual proteins, but currently offer only limited capabilities due to the fast translocation of target. Here, w e developed a reliable and facile method to convert the silicon nitride nanopore to a stable nanonet platform for single entity sensing by electrophoretic or electroosmotic trapping. The nanonet w as fabricated based on a material reorganization process caused by the e&#8208;beam and light irradiation treatments. Using protein molecule as the model, it reveals that the solid&#8208;state nanonet can produce collision and trapping flipping signals of protein, which provide more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. More important, thanks to the excellent stability of the solid&#8208;state silicon nitride nanonet, w e demonstrated that the UV irradiation induced structural change process of an individual protein can be captured. The developed nanonet supplies a robust platform for the single&#8208;entity studies but not limited to proteins.

         <title>Mechanically Active Materials and Devices for Bio&#8208;Interfaced Pressure Sensors&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest progress in bio&#8208;interfaced pressure sensors is reviewed. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable accurate, safe monitoring for extended periods of time. Recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs provide a range of application opportunities for implantable and skin&#8208;mounted systems.








Abstract
Pressures generated by external forces or by internal body processes represent parameters of critical importance in diagnosing physiological health and in anticipating injuries. Examples span intracranial hypertension from traumatic brain injuries, high blood pressure from poor diet, pressure&#8208;induced skin ulcers from immobility, and edema from congestive heart failure. Pressures measured on the soft surfaces of vital organs or within internal cavities of the body can provide essential insights into patient status and progression. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance pressure sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable safe monitoring for extended periods of time. This review focuses on recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs for classes of soft pressure sensors that have proven uses in these contexts. The discussions include applications of such sensors as implantable and wearable systems, with various unique capabilities in wireless continuous monitoring, minimally invasive deployment, natural degradation in biofluids, and/or multiplexed spatiotemporal mapping. A concluding section summarizes challenges and future opportunities for this growing field of materials and biomedical research.

         <title>A Biomolecular Toolbox for Precision Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomotors are a new and exciting field of research for biomedical applications. Many diverse nanomotor systems have been studied in recent years with great promise. Precision targeting of nanomotors is necessary for translation from the laboratory to the clinic. A biomolecular toolbox to achieve precision targeting is presented, consisting of targeting molecules, conjugation strategies, and extracellular targets.








Abstract
The application of nanomotors for cancer diagnosis and therapy is a new and exciting area of research, which when combined with precision nanomedicine, promises to solve many of the issues encountered by previous development of passive nanoparticles. The goal of this article is to introduce nanomotor and nanomedicine researchers to the deep pool of knowledge available regarding cancer cell biology and biochemistry, as well as provide a greater appreciation of the complexity of cell membrane compositions, extracellular surfaces, and their functional consequences. A short description of the nanomotor state&#8208;of&#8208;art for cancer therapy and diagnosis is first provided, as well as recommendations for future directions of the field. Then, a biomolecular targeting toolbox has been collated for researchers looking to apply their nanomaterial of choice to a biological setting, as well as providing a glimpse into currently available clinical therapies and technologies. This toolbox contains an overview of different classes of targeting molecules available for high affinity and specific targeting and cell surface targets to aid researchers in the selection of a clinical disease model and targeting methodology. It is hoped that this review will provide biological context, inspiration, and direction to future nanomotor and nanomedicine research.

         <title>Printable Thermochromic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Smart Window for All&#8208;Weather Building Temperature Regulation in Diverse Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows are widely developed to modulate building energy exchange to save building energy consumption. However, most smart windows have fixed working temperature, moderate energy saving efficiency, and are not suitable for diverse (cold and hot) climates. Here we report smart windows with strong temperature modulation over a broad range by hydrogels with adjustable transition temperatures for all&#8208;weather building temperature regulation in different climates. Thermochromic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylmide&#8208;co&#8208;N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels, with lower critical transition temperature ranging from 32.5 to 43.5&#176;C, are developed for smart windows with solar modulation up to 88.84% and intrinsic transmittance up to 91.30% over full spectrum without energy input. Simulated indoor investigations are performed in different cities from 23 &#176;N to 39 &#176;N from winter to summer. The results indicate that the smart windows have a strong solar modulation in summer to reduce indoor temperature up to 7.3&#176;C and efficient heat conservation in winter to save energy up to 4.30 J m&#8722;3, in comparison to glass windows. Smart windows with grid patterns and Chinese kirigami are fabricated by using 3D printing of the hydrogels to achieve both solar modulation and light incidence. The strategy offers an innovative path for thermochromic smart windows for low carbon economy.

         <title>Extremely Strong and Tough Biodegradable Poly(urethane) Elastomers with Unprecedented Crack Tolerance via Hierarchical Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The elastomers with the combination of high strength and high toughness have always been intensively pursued due to their diverse applications. Biomedical applications frequently require elastomers with biodegradability and biocompatibility properties. It remains a great challenge to prepare the biodegradable elastomers with extremely robust mechanical properties for in vivo use. In this report, we present a polyurethane elastomer with unprecedented mechanical properties for the in vivo application as hernia patches, which was obtained by the solvent&#8208;free reaction of polycaprolactone (PCL) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) with N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)oxamide (BHO) as the chain extender. Abundant and hierarchical hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions inside the elastomers hinder the crystallization of PCL segments and facilitate the formation of uniformly distributed hard phase microdomains, which miraculously realize the extremely high strength and toughness with the fracture strength of 92.2&#160;MPa and true stress of 1.9&#160;GPa, while maintaining the elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break of &#8764;1900% and ultrahigh toughness of 480.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 with the unprecedented fracture energy of 322.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. Hernia patches made from the elastomer via 3D printing technology exhibit outstanding mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. The robust and biodegradable elastomers demonstrate considerable potentials for in vivo applications.

Abundant and hierarchical hydrogen-bonding interactions inside the elastomers hinder the crystallization of PCL segments and facilitate the formation of uniformly distributed hard phase microdomains, which miraculously realize the extremely high strength and toughness with the fracture strength of 92.2&#160;MPa and true stress of 1.9&#160;GPa, while maintaining the elongation-at-break of &#8764;1900% and ultrahigh toughness of 480.2&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the unprecedented fracture energy of 322.2&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hernia patches made from the elastomer via 3D printing technology exhibit outstanding mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. The robust and biodegradable elastomers demonstrate considerable potentials for in vivo applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intrinsic Anti&#8208;Freezing and Unique Phosphorescence of Glassy Hydrogels with Ultrahigh Stiffness and Toughness at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Most hydrogels become frozen at subzero temperatures, leading to degraded properties and limited applications. Cryoprotectants are massively employed to improve anti&#8208;freezing property of hydrogels; however, there are accompanied disadvantages, such as varied networks, reduced mechanical properties, and the risk of cryoprotectant leakage in aqueous conditions. Reported here is the glassy hydrogel having intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing capacity, excellent optical and mechanical properties at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Supramolecular hydrogel of poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid) with moderate water content (&#8764;50 wt%) and dense hydrogen&#8208;bond associations is in a glassy state at room temperature. Since hydrogen bonds become strengthened as the temperature decreases, this gel become stronger and stiffer, yet still ductile, with Young's modulus of 900&#160;MPa, tensile strength of 30&#160;MPa, and breaking strain of 35% at &#8208;45 &#176;C. This gel retains high transparency even in liquid nitrogen. It also exhibits unique phosphorescence due to presence of carbonyl clusters, which is further enhanced at subzero temperatures. Further investigations elucidate that the intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing property is related to a fact that most water molecules are tightly bound and confined in the glassy matrix and become non&#8208;freezable. This correlation, as validated in several systems, provides a roadmap to develop intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels for widespread applications at extreme conditions.

         <title>Temperature Dependent Reversal of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of light&#8208;induced halide segregation in mixed halide perovskites is essential for their application in multi&#8208;junction solar cells. Here, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to uncover how both increases in temperature and light intensity can counteract the halide segregation process. It is observed that, with increasing temperature, halide segregation in MAPb(Br0.4I0.6)3 first accelerates towards &#8764; 290&#160;K, before slowing down again towards higher temperatures. Such reversal is attributed to the trade&#8208;off between the temperature activation of segregation, e.g. through enhanced ionic migration, and its inhibition by entropic factors. High light intensities meanwhile can also reverse halide segregation, however, this is found to be only a transient process that abates on the time scale of minutes. Overall, these observations pave the way for a more complete model of halide segregation and aid the development of highly efficient and stable perovskite multi&#8208;junction and concentrator&#160;photovoltaics.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for Two&#8208;dimensional Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gap are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, m&#8208;ZrO2 shows good potential because of its inertness and high&#8208;&#954; with respect to SiO2, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, w e achieve the controllable preparation of ultrathin m&#8208;ZrO2 single crystals via the in&#8208;situ thermal oxidation of ZrS2. As&#8208;grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8764;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8764;19 and breakdown voltage of &#8764;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) by using m&#8208;ZrO2 as dielectric layer show a comparable mobility to that using SiO2 dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m&#8208;ZrO2/MoS2 and high crystalline quality of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor logic FET.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides and non&#8208;fused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the chemical structures and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Vesicles for Enhancing CAR&#8208;T Therapy Against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CAR&#8208;T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in eradicating hematologic malignancies. However, its efficacy in treating solid tumors has always been limited due to the presence of an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficiency of anti&#8208;mesothelin CAR&#8208;T cells in orthotopic lung cancer. As anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv can specifically bind to the PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs enable the targeted delivery of glutamine antagonists to the tumor site, disturb PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory signaling, and address the upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells caused by the treatment of glutamine antagonists and CAR&#8208;T cells, which prevents the premature exhaustion of CAR&#8208;T cells. More importantly, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs effectively reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells and promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in tumor tissues. These unique features of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs improve the infiltration and effector functions of CAR&#8208;T cells, which ultimately enhance the anti&#8208;tumor ability and long&#8208;term memory immunity of CAR&#8208;T cells. Our findings support that D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs act as a promising drug to strengthen the effectiveness of CAR&#8208;T cells against solid tumors.

Abstract
Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it as a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance is discussed here, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels.

         <title>FeNC Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalyst with High Utilization Penta&#8208;Coordinated Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon oxygen reduction electrocatalyst with penta&#8208;coordinated sites and high electrochemical active sites utilization is prepared by low&#8208;temperature Fe coordination in a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon synthetized through the ionothermal pyrolysis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine. The structure of the active site is studied by means of X&#8208;ray absorption and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and the effect of axial ligands through density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Atomic Fe in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNC) electrocatalysts for oxygen (O2) reduction at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells are the most promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal catalysts. Despite recent progress on atomic FeNC O2&#160;reduction, their controlled synthesis and stability for practical applications remain challenging. A two&#8208;step synthesis approach has recently led to significant advances in terms of Fe&#8208;loading and mass activity; however, the Fe utilization remains low owing to the difficulty of building scaffolds with sufficient porosity that electrochemically exposes the active sites. Herein, this issue is addressed by coordinating Fe in a highly porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (&#8776;3295&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), prepared by pyrolysis of inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;triaminopyrimidine and a Mg2+ salt active site template and porogen. Upon Fe coordination, a high electrochemical active site density of 2.54&#160;&#215;&#160;1019&#160;sites&#160;gFeNC&#8722;1&#160;and a record 52% FeNx electrochemical utilization based on in situ nitrite stripping are achieved. The Fe single atoms are characterized pre&#8208; and post&#8208;electrochemical accelerated stress testing by aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, showing no Fe clustering. Moreover, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy suggest the presence of penta&#8208;coordinated Fe sites, which are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>A Matrix&#8208;Metalloproteinase&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel System for Modulating the Immune Microenvironment in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9&#8208;responsive hydrogel system (MPGC4) are developed based on the post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI) microenvironment. MPGC4 can be triggered by highly expressed MMP2/9 after MI to release on&#8208;demand interleukin&#8208;4 plasmid DNA that promote M2 macrophage polarization early in the infarction and participate in inflammatory repair. MPGC4 also inhibited the activity of MMP2/9 and reduced the degradation of cardiac extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels carrying therapeutic factors to modulate the infarct immune microenvironment show great potential in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). However, conventional injectable hydrogels release therapeutic factors in an uncontrolled manner, which leads to poor treatment efficacy and acute side effects on normal tissues. In&#160;this&#160;work, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9&#8208;responsive hydrogel system (MPGC4) is developed, considering the characteristics of the post&#8208;MI microenvironment. MPGC4 consists of tetra&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels and a composite gene nanocarrier (CTL4) that is composed of carbon dots (CDots) coupled with interleukin&#8208;4 plasmid DNA via electrostatic interactions. MPGC4 can be automatically triggered to release CTL4 on demand after MI to regulate the infarct immune microenvironment. In addition, due to the photoluminescence properties of CDots, a large amount of viscoelastic MPGC4 is found to be retained in situ after injection into the infarct region without leakage. The in vitro results demonstrate that CTL4 promotes proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarization to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype and contributes to cardiomyocyte survival through macrophage transition. In a rat model of MI, MPGC4 clears MMPs and precisely targets CTL4 to the infarcted region. In particular, MPGC4 improves cardiac function by modulating macrophage transition to reduce early inflammatory responses and proangiogenic activity.

         <title>Triple Threshold Transitions and Strong Polariton Interaction in 2D Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Microplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework is&#160;introduced&#160;as a new type of quantum material, with naturally formed polariton cavities, that&#160;is a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution to develop next&#8208;gen microscale quantum light sources and polaritonic devices.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature interaction between light&#8211;matter hybrid particles such as exciton&#8211;polaritons under extremely low&#8208;pump plays a crucial role in future coherent quantum light sources. However, the practical and scalable realization of coherent quantum light sources operating under low&#8208;pump remains a challenge because of the insufficient polariton interaction strength. Here, at room temperature, a very large polariton interaction strength is demonstrated, g&#160;&#8776; 128 &#177; 21 &#181;eV &#181;m2 realized in a 2D nanolayered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). As a result, a polariton lasing at an extremely&#160;low pump fluence of P1&#160;&#8776; 0.01 &#177; 0.0015 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 (first threshold) is observed. Interestingly, as pump fluencies increase to P2&#160;&#8776; 0.031 &#177; 0.003 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 (second threshold), a spontaneous transition to a polariton breakdown region occurrs, which&#160;has not&#160;been reported before. Finally, an ordinary photon lasing occurrs at P3&#160;&#8776; 0.11 &#177; 0.077 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 (third threshold), or above. These experiments and the theoretical model reveal new insights into the transition mechanisms characterized by three distinct optical regions. This work introduces MOF as a new type of quantum material, with naturally formed polariton cavities, that&#160;is a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution to build microscale coherent quantum light sources and polaritonic devices.

Abstract
Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. 1D fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink&#8208;extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences;&#160;it not only assembles carbon nanotubes and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) to compose a sturdy, conductive, and agglomeration&#8208;free 3D network that realizes an ultra&#8208;high content (75&#160;wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility&#160;but&#160;also&#160;serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;1 per fiber) and packing density (782.1 mg&#160;cm&#8722;3). As a result, the assembled fiber LIBs deliver impressive linear and volumetric energy densities with superb mechanical compliance, demonstrating the best performance among all the reported extruded fiber batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. 1D fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high-mass-loading fiber lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink-extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole-modified reduced graphene oxide is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences;&#160;it not only assembles carbon nanotubes and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) to compose a sturdy, conductive, and agglomeration-free 3D network that realizes an ultra-high content (75&#160;wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility&#160;but&#160;also&#160;serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per fiber) and packing density (782.1 mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). As a result, the assembled fiber LIBs deliver impressive linear and volumetric energy densities with superb mechanical compliance, demonstrating the best performance among all the reported extruded fiber batteries. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach to fabricate high-performance fiber energy storage devices for future practical wearable applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering of Single/Dual&#8208;atom Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single/dual&#8208;metal atoms supported on carbon matrix can be modulated by coordination structure and neighboring active sites. Precisely designing the geometric and electronic structure and uncovering the structure&#8208;property relationships of single/dual&#8208;metal atoms confront with grand challenges. Herein, this review summarizes the latest progress in microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom active sites via a comprehensive comparison of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) in term of design principles, modulation strategy, and theoretical understanding of structure&#8208;performance correlations. Subsequently, recent advances in several typical electrocatalysis process are discussed to get general understanding of the reaction mechanisms on finely&#8208;tuned SACs and DACs. Finally, full&#8208;scaled summaries of the challenges and prospects are given for microenvironment engineering of SACs and DACs. This review will provide new inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrocatalytic application.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides and halides are individually applied as Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds have not been studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. We designed a heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1 &#8211; xFx) coating layer by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1 &#8211; xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1 &#8211; xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1, 000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 for 1, 000 cycles. This work might enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>In&#160;Liquido Computation with Electrochemical Transistors and Mixed Conductors for Intelligent Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have&#160;emerged as ideal elements for a multitude of applications in bioelectronics. However, integration of multiple OECTs is still challenging because the electrolyte &#8220;shorts&#8221; all the devices producing unwanted crosstalk. Such crosstalks are explained and modeled and strategies to avoid it, or alternatively, to harness it in order to produce intelligent bioelectronics are discussed.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable computational devices require long&#8208;term&#8208;stable electronic components capable of operating in, and interacting with, electrolytic surroundings without being damaged. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) emerged as fitting candidates. However, while single devices feature impressive figures&#160;of merit, integrated circuits (ICs) immersed in common electrolytes are hard to realize using electrochemical transistors, and there is no clear path forward for optimal top&#8208;down circuit design and high&#8208;density integration. The simple observation that two OECTs immersed in the same electrolytic medium will inevitably interact hampers their implementation in complex circuitry. The electrolyte's ionic conductivity connects all the devices in the liquid, producing unwanted and often unforeseeable dynamics. Minimizing or harnessing this crosstalk has been the focus of very recent studies. Herein, the main challenges, trends, and opportunities for realizing OECT&#8208;based circuitry in a liquid environment that could circumnavigate the hard limits of engineering and human physiology, are discussed. The most successful approaches in autonomous bioelectronics and information processing are analyzed. Elaborating on the strategies to circumvent and harness device crosstalk proves that platforms capable of complex computation and even machine learning (ML) can be realized in&#160;liquido using mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs).

         <title>Phase&#8208;changeable Dynamic Conformal Electrode/electrolyte Interlayer enabling Pressure&#8208;Independent Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (equal to 1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8208;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here we&#160;explore a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs), identify the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior, and demonstrate properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20 &#8722; 50&#8201;&#181;F/cm2 (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges). Using two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides we&#160;demonstrate the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;liquid gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

&lt;p&gt;Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field-effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid-state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here we&#160;explore a class of solid-state electrolytes for gating (Lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramics, LICGCs), identify the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior, and demonstrate properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20 &#8722; 50&#8201;&#181;F/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges). Using two-dimensional semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides we&#160;demonstrate the ability to implement ionic-gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in gate-induced superconductivity in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back-gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface-sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic-liquid gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Crystalline Spinning Enables Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performing Fibrous Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Leveraging liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to realize scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performing fibrous artificial muscles is of particular interest because these active soft materials can provide large, reversible, programmable deformations upon environmental stimuli. High&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs require the used processing technology to enable shaping LCEs into micro&#8208;scale fine fibers as thin as possible while achieving macroscopic LC orientation, which however remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a bioinspired spinning technology that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production (fabrication speed up to 8400 m/h) of thin and aligned LCE microfibers combined with rapid deformation (actuation strain rate up to 810% s&#8722;1), powerful actuation (actuation stress up to 5.3&#160;MPa), high response frequency (50&#160;Hz), and long cycle life (250000 cycles without obvious fatigue). Inspired by liquid crystalline spinning of spiders that take advantage of multiple drawdowns to thin and align their dragline silks, we employed internal drawdown via tapered&#8208;wall&#8208;induced&#8208;shearing and external drawdown via mechanical stretching to shape LCEs into long, thin, aligned microfibers with the desirable actuation performances, which few processing technologies can achieve. This bioinspired processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.

         <title>Self&#8208;doping Naphthalene Diimide Conjugated Polymers for Flexible Unipolar n&#8208;type OTFTs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) materials is vital for flexible electronics. Numerous OTFTs have so far been reported but obtaining high&#8208;performance and reliable OTFTs simultaneously for flexible electronics is still challenging. Herein, we report self&#8208;doping in conjugated polymer enables high unipolar n&#8208;type charge mobility in flexible OTFTs, as well as good operational/ambient stability and bending resistance. New naphthalene diimide (NDI) conjugated polymers PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 and PNDI2T&#8208;NM50 with different contents of self&#8208;doping groups on their side chains were designed and synthesized. The effects of self&#8208;doping on the electronic properties of resulting flexible OTFTs were investigated. The results revealed the flexible OTFTs based on self&#8208;doped PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 exhibited unipolar n&#8208;type charge&#8208;carrier properties and good operational/ambient stability thanks to the appropriate doping level and intermolecular interactions. The charge mobility and on/off ratio were four&#8208;fold and four&#8208;orders of magnitude higher than those of undoped model polymer, respectively. Overall, the proposed self&#8208;doping strategy is useful for rationally designing OTFT materials with high semiconducting performance and reliability.

         <title>High&#8208;performance, highly stretchable, flexible moist&#8208;electric generators via molecular engineering of hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Harvesting energy from ubiquitous moisture has emerged as a promising technology, offering opportunities to power wearable electronics. However, low current density and inadequate stretching limit their integration into self&#8208;powered wearables. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;performance, highly stretchable, and flexible moist&#8208;electric generator (MEG) via molecular engineering of hydrogels. The molecular engineering involves the impregnation of lithium ions and sulfonic acid groups into the polymer molecular chains to create ion&#8208;conductive and stretchable hydrogels. This new strategy fully leverages the molecular structure of polymer chains, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. A centimeter&#8208;sized hydrogel&#8208;based MEG can generate an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.81&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 480&#160;&#956;A cm&#8722;2. This current density is more than ten times that of most reported MEGs. Moreover, molecular engineering improves the mechanical properties of hydrogels, resulting in a stretchability of 506%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level in reported MEGs. Notably, large&#8208;scale integration of the high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs is demonstrated to power wearables with integrated electronics, including respiration monitoring masks, smart helmets, and medical suits. This work provides fresh insights into the design of high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs, facilitating their application to self&#8208;powered wearables and broadening the application scenario.

Abstract
Nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented ultrasound (US) medicine is a unique area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on designing and engineering functional nanosystems to address the challenging issues in US&#8208;based biomedicine, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional microbubbles and optimizing the design of contrast and sonosensitive agents. The single&#8208;faceted summary of available US&#8208;related therapies is still a significant drawback. Here, we aim to propose a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT). The design concepts of the specific sono&#8208;therapies based on nanomedicines are initially introduced. Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides the updated and comprehensive review in the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progresses of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects are expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

         <title>Quantum Composites with the Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Fillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate a unique class of advanced materials &#8211; quantum composites based on polymers with fillers comprised of a van der Waals quantum material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases. Materials that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons, leading to collapses of the quantum states. We succeeded in preserving the macroscopic charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phases of filler particles after multiple composite processing steps. The prepared composites manifest strong charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials, extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable Two&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Perovskites</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional, hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, we&#160;demonstrate an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures. We&#160;show bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. It reveals the emergence of both negatively&#8208; and positively&#8208;charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest ones measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2/(Vs) at elevated temperatures. Our&#160;findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8208;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform towards electrically&#8208;modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle (FAOM) Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>

Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet our ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, we describe a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device that integrates tubular DNA origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. Skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose in situ and transfer the input into proton signal with oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA origami tubes separated fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggested that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, FAOM achieved well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70 &#177; 4.77%) compared with commercial blood biochemical analyser and completely meets the requirements of accurately monitoring blood glucose. FAOM device could be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of blood glucose test.

         <title>Metasurface Enabled On&#8208;Chip Generation and Manipulation of Vector Beams from Vertical Cavity Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip generation and manipulation of vector beams are demonstrated by monolithically integrating vectorial metasurfaces with standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs). The developed approach enables a powerful tool to structure the complex wavefronts of a VCSEL in an ultracompact way, providing the access to previously unattainable both phase and polarization degrees of freedom.








Abstract
Metasurface polarization optics that consist of 2D array of birefringent nano&#8208;antennas have proven remarkable capabilities to generate and manipulate vectorial fields with subwavelength resolution and high efficiency. Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting laser (VCSEL) platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on&#8208;demand wavefronts. Here, this concept is demonstrated by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on&#8208;chip integration of high&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of the approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

         <title>All&#8208;Liquid Reconfigurable Electronics Using Jammed MXene Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured liquids provide a route to self&#8208;assemble functional materials at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface and to shape liquids into arbitrary geometries. In this work, the high conductivity of MXenes is leveraged to create conductive pathways at the interface. The electrical properties of the assemblies are characterized and initial all&#8208;liquid electronic devices are presented.








Abstract
Rigid, solid&#8208;state components represent the current paradigm for electronic systems, but they lack post&#8208;production reconfigurability and pose ever&#8208;increasing challenges to efficient end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Liquid electronics may overcome these limitations by offering flexible in&#8208;the&#8208;field redesign and separation at end&#8208;of&#8208;life via simple liquid phase chemistries. Up to now, preliminary work on liquid electronics has focused on liquid metal components, but these devices still require an encapsulating polymer and typically use alloys of rare elements like indium. Here, using the self&#8208;assembly of jammed 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene nanoparticles at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, &#8220;all&#8208;liquid&#8221; electrically conductive sheets, wires, and simple functional devices are described including electromechanical switches and photodetectors. These assemblies combine the high conductivity of MXene nanosheets with the controllable form and reconfigurability of structured liquids. Such configurations can have applications not only in electronics, but also in catalysis and microfluidics, especially in systems where the product and substrate have affinity for solvents of differing polarity.

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid interfaces play a critical role in the electrochemical performance of solid&#8208;state batteries. This review provides an overview on the solid&#8211;solid interfaces from aspects of structural features, Li&#8208;ion transport, interfacial contact, and electro&#8208;chemical reactions. The existing interface issues and improvement strategies are discussed. Opportunities and future trends on the investigation and optimization of these interfaces are highlighted.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8211;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this review, the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors are discussed. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8211;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanogenerator&#8208;Integrated Metamaterial Concrete Systems for Smart Civil Infrastructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight composite metamaterial concrete with unprecedented mechanical properties and energy harvesting and sensing functionalities is presented. The metamaterial concrete systems are composed of auxetic lattices embedded inside a conductive cement matrix. They are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W.








Abstract
Creating multifunctional concrete materials with advanced functionalities and mechanical tunability is a critical step toward reimagining the traditional civil infrastructure systems. Here, the concept of nanogenerator&#8208;integrated mechanical metamaterial concrete is presented to design lightweight and mechanically tunable concrete systems with energy harvesting and sensing functionalities. The proposed metamaterial concrete systems are created via integrating the mechanical metamaterial and nano&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting paradigms. These advanced materials are composed of reinforcement auxetic polymer lattices with snap&#8208;through buckling behavior fully embedded inside a conductive cement matrix.&#160;We&#160;rationally design their composite structures to induce contact&#8208;electrification between the layers under mechanical excitations/triggering. The conductive cement enhanced with graphite powder serves as the electrode in the proposed systems, while providing the desired mechanical performance. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of the designed prototypes. The metamaterial concrete systems are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility under cycling loading. The power output of the nanogenerator&#8208;integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W. Furthermore, the self&#8208;powered sensing functionality of the nanogenerator concrete systems for distributed health monitoring of large&#8208;scale concrete structures&#160;is&#160;demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of lightweight composite metamaterial concrete with unprecedented mechanical properties and energy harvesting and sensing functionalities is presented. The metamaterial concrete systems are composed of auxetic lattices embedded inside a conductive cement matrix. They are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility. The power output of the nanogenerator-integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating multifunctional concrete materials with advanced functionalities and mechanical tunability is a critical step toward reimagining the traditional civil infrastructure systems. Here, the concept of nanogenerator-integrated mechanical metamaterial concrete is presented to design lightweight and mechanically tunable concrete systems with energy harvesting and sensing functionalities. The proposed metamaterial concrete systems are created via integrating the mechanical metamaterial and nano-energy-harvesting paradigms. These advanced materials are composed of reinforcement auxetic polymer lattices with snap-through buckling behavior fully embedded inside a conductive cement matrix.&#160;We&#160;rationally design their composite structures to induce contact-electrification between the layers under mechanical excitations/triggering. The conductive cement enhanced with graphite powder serves as the electrode in the proposed systems, while providing the desired mechanical performance. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of the designed prototypes. The metamaterial concrete systems are tuned to achieve up to 15% compressibility under cycling loading. The power output of the nanogenerator-integrated metamaterial concrete prototypes reaches 330 &#181;W. Furthermore, the self-powered sensing functionality of the nanogenerator concrete systems for distributed health monitoring of large-scale concrete structures&#160;is&#160;demonstrated. The metamaterial concrete paradigm can possibly enable the&#160;design&#160;of smart civil infrastructure systems with a broad range of advanced functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Whole&#8208;Course&#8208;Repair System Based on Neurogenesis&#8208;Angiogenesis Crosstalk and Macrophage Reprogramming Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing</title>

Abstract
Diabetic wound (DW) therapy is currently a big challenge in medicine and strategies to enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis have appeared to be a promising direction. However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, we introduce a whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment. This hydrogel can firstly be one&#8208;step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long&#8208;termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of Mg2+ and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self&#8208;healing and bio&#8208;adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg2+, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons From CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, is yet to be fully understood. Oxygen vacancy (OVs) engineering can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position OVs engineering as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of roles of OVs in both CO2RR and NO3RR. We start with a description of approaches to constructing OVs and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of CO2RR and a detailed discussion on roles of OVs in CO2RR. Then, we offer insights into the mechanism of NO3RR and highlights the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings. Finally, the challenges in designing CO2RR/NO3RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OVs engineering are provided.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructure of Plant Polyphenol and Arginine Surfactant for Long&#8208;lasting and Target&#8208;selective Antimicrobial Application</title>

Abstract
Antimicrobial agents have been massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the COVID&#8208;19 outbreak. However, their defects of poor durability, strong irritation, and high environmental accumulation have exposed. Herein, a convenient strategy is developed to fabricate long&#8208;lasting and target&#8208;selective antimicrobial agent with the special hierarchical structure through bottom&#8208;up assembly of natural gallic acid with arginine surfactant. The assembly starts from rodlike micelles, further stacking into hexagonal columns and finally interpenetrating into spherical assemblies, which avoids explosive release of antimicrobial units. The assemblies show anti&#8208;water washing and high adhesion on various surfaces, and thus possess highly efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activities even after using up to 11 cycles. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that the assemblies are highly selective in killing pathogens without generating toxicity. The excellent antimicrobial virtues well satisfy the increasing anti&#8208;infection demands and the hierarchical assembly exhibits great potential as a clinical candidate.

         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6, is introduced into the 2D family, exhibiting a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and ultrahigh on/off ratio exceeding 106. In particular, CuBiP2Se6&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals devices exhibit outstanding comprehensive optoelectronic performance, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices.








Abstract
The notable lack of intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D layered semiconductors has hindered the engineering of 2D devices for complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOSs). Herein, a novel quaternary intrinsic p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor, CuBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is introduced into&#160;the&#160;2D family. The semiconductor displays a high work function of 5.26&#160;eV, a moderate hole mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh on/off current exceeding 106 at room temperature. To date, 5.26&#160;eV is the highest work&#8208;function recorded in p&#8208;type 2D materials, indicating the ultrastable p&#8208;type behavior of CuBiP2Se6. Additionally, a multilayer graphene/CuBiP2Se6/multilayer graphene (MLG/CBPS/MLG)&#8208;based fully vertical van der Waals heterostructure phototransistor is designed and fabricated. This device exhibits outstanding optoelectronic performance with a responsivity (R) of 4.9 &#215;&#160;104 A W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.5 &#215;&#160;107%, a detectivity (D) of 1.14 &#215;&#160;1013 Jones, and a broad working wavelength (400&#8211;1100&#160;nm), respectively. This is comparable&#160;to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices. Such excellent performance is attributed to the ultrashort transmit length and nondestructive/defect&#8208;free contacts. This leads to faster response speed and eliminates Fermi&#8208;level&#160;pinning&#160;effects. Moreover, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity endow the device with applaudable imaging sensing capability. These results make CuBiP2Se6 an ideal p&#8208;type candidate material for next&#8208;generation CMOSs logic devices.

The different sensing mechanisms that exploit structural or electronic/ionic&#8208;transport changes resulting from the interaction of the supramolecular nanostructures with water molecules to read out the environmental humidity with key performance indicators beyond the state of the art are discussed.








Abstract
Precise monitoring of the humidity level is important for the living comfort and for many applications in various industrial sectors. Humidity sensors have thus become one among the most extensively studied and used chemical sensors by targeting a maximal device performance through the optimization of the components and working mechanism. Among different moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, supramolecular nanostructures are ideal active materials for the next generation of highly efficient humidity sensors. Their noncovalent nature guarantees fast response, high reversibility, and fast recovery time in the sensing event. Herein, the most enlightening recent strategies on the use of supramolecular nanostructures for humidity sensing are showcased. The key performance indicators in humidity sensing, including operation range, sensitivity, selectivity, response, and recovery speed are discussed as milestones for true practical applications. Some of the most remarkable examples of supramolecular&#8208;based humidity sensors are presented, by describing the finest sensing materials, the operating principles, and sensing mechanisms, the latter being based on the structural or charge&#8208;transport changes triggered by the interaction of the supramolecular nanostructures with the ambient humidity. Finally, the future directions, challenges, and opportunities for the development of humidity sensors with performance beyond the state of the art are discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Nanophotonics over the Full Visible Spectrum Enabled by Hexagonal Boron Nitride Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors demonstrate how the combination of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index resonator materials such as hexagonal boron nitride and symmetry&#8208;broken bound states in the continuum overcomes the lack of high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index and lossless materials in the visible&#160;region. Following this approach, high&#8208;Q photonic resonances over the full visible spectrum are realized and used to enhance second&#8208;harmonic generation in the ultraviolet&#160;region.








Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric optical metasurfaces with high quality (Q) factors have been hampered by the lack of simultaneously lossless and high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials over the full visible spectrum. In fact, the use of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials is unavoidable for extending the spectral coverage due to the inverse correlation between the bandgap energy (and therefore the optical losses) and the refractive index (n). However, for Mie resonant photonics, smaller refractive indices&#160;are associated with reduced Q factors and low mode volume confinement. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken quasi&#160;bound&#160;states in the continuum (qBICs) are&#160;leveraged&#160;to efficiently suppress radiation losses from the low&#8208;index (n&#160;&#8776;&#160;2) van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), realizing metasurfaces with high&#8208;Q resonances over the complete visible spectrum. The rational use of low&#8208; and high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials as resonator components is analyzed and the insights are harnessed to experimentally demonstrate sharp qBIC resonances with Q factors above 300, spanning wavelengths between 400&#160;and 1000&#160;nm from a single hBN flake. Moreover, the enhanced electric near fields are utilized to demonstrate second&#8208;harmonic generation with enhancement factors above 102. These&#160;results provide a theoretical and experimental framework for the implementation of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials as photonic media for metaoptics.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Topological States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental realization of higher&#8208;order thermal topological states in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice&#160;is&#160;reported. The topological edge and corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate spectrum that isolated from the bulk. Topological protection of these thermal domain&#8208;wall states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profiles in the presence of amorphous deformation.








Abstract
Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher&#8208;order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges. While band topology has been recently extended into thermal diffusion for thermal metamaterials, its realization is limited to a 1D thermal lattice, lacking access to the higher&#8208;order topology. In this work, the experimental realization is reported of a higher&#8208;order thermal topological insulator in a generalized 2D diffusion lattice. The topological corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate of the bulk, as a consequence of the anti&#8208;Hermitian nature of the diffusion Hamiltonian. The topological protection of these thermal corner states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profile in the presence of amorphous deformation. This work constitutes the first realization of higher&#8208;order topology in purely diffusive systems and opens the door for future thermal management with topological protection beyond 1D geometries.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Switching Based on Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photoactivation of Charge Trapping in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite can be switched by other light with sub&#8208;bandgap photon energy in a broad spectral range with high stability. This effect is controlled by photosensitive defects, in which concentration is modified by the&#160;crystal stoichiometry. This finding indicates a new application area of metal halide perovskites in optical switches, transistors, and memory.








Abstract
Controllable optical properties are crucial for the application of light&#8208;emitting materials in optical devices. In this work, controllable photoluminescence in metal halide perovskite crystals is realized via photoactivation of their defects. It is found that under continuous excitation, the photoluminescence intensity of a CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal can be fully controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap energy photon illumination. Such optically controllable emission behavior is rather general as it is observed also in CsPbBr3 and other perovskite materials. The switching mechanism is assigned to reversible light&#8208;induced activation/deactivation of nonradiative recombination centers, the presence of which relates to an excess of Pb during perovskite synthesis. Given the success of perovskites in photovoltaics and optoelectronics, it is believed that the discovery of green luminescence controlled by red illumination will extend the application scope of perovskites toward optical devices and intelligent control.

         <title>Non&#8208;Destructive Low&#8208;Temperature Contacts to MoS2 Nanoribbon and Nanotube Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes grown from vapor phase are a low&#8208;defect&#8208;density nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Devices integrating them with bismuth&#8208;based contacts show strongly reduced contact resistances and a marked absence of trap states at cryogenic temperatures. This allows for quantum&#8208;dot Coulomb blockade measurements. Single&#8208;level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100mK.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes are quasi&#8208;1D&#160;semiconductors with strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction, a nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Here, it is demonstrated that a bismuth semimetal layer between the contact metal and this nanomaterial strongly improves the properties of the contacts. Two&#8208;point resistances on the order of 100&#160;k&#937; are observed at room temperature. At cryogenic temperature, Coulomb blockade is visible. The resulting stability diagrams indicate a marked absence of trap states at the contacts and the corresponding disorder, compared to previous devices that use low&#8208;work&#8208;function metals as contacts. Single&#8208;level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100&#160;mK.

         <title>Dynamically Tunable Optical Cavities with Embedded Nematic Liquid Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tuning mechanism for Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonators, that employs reversible mechanical adaptations of a polymer network to dynamically tune the reflectance,&#160;is&#160;developed. A&#160;liquid crystalline network is&#160;incorporated&#160;between metallic mirrors, to show large, reversible and highly linear spectral tuning of reflection resonances over the entire visible and near&#8208;infrared spectral regions with absolute modulation &#916;R&#160;=&#160;79%.








Abstract

         <title>Design Strategies for Hydroxyapatite&#8208;Based Materials to Enhance Their Catalytic Performance and Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a potentially important catalytic material with high flexibility and multifunctionality. A variety of HAP modification methods to achieve high catalytic performance are discussed, including ionic composition change, morphology control, dopant engineering, and catalyst support engineering. Experimental and theoretical explorations to understand structure&#8211;activity relations are also covered to provide the design strategies for HAP catalytic materials.








Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a green catalyst that has a wide range of applications in catalysis due to its high flexibility and multifunctionality. These properties allow HAP to accommodate a large number of catalyst modifications that can selectively improve the catalytic performance in target reactions. To date, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of HAP modification on the catalytic activities for various reactions. However, systematic design strategies for HAP catalysts are not established yet due to an incomplete understanding of underlying structure&#8211;activity relationships. In this review, tuning methods of HAP for improving the catalytic performance are discussed: 1) ionic composition change, 2) morphology control, 3) incorporation of other metal species, and 4) catalytic support engineering. Detailed mechanisms and effects of structural modulations on the catalytic performances for attaining the design insights of HAP catalysts are investigated. In addition, computational studies to understand catalytic reactions on HAP materials are also introduced. Finally, important areas for future research are highlighted.

         <title>Catalytic Amounts of an Antibacterial Monomer Enable the Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with an annual output second only to polyethylene. The development of PET recycling technologies is therefore necessary to not only eliminate the harm associated with white pollution and microplastics, but also to reduce carbon emissions. Antibacterial PET, one of the most high&#8208;value advanced materials, has improved our ability to treat bacterial infections. However, current methods of manufacturing commercial antibacterial PET require blending with an excess of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents, which leads to biotoxicity and a nonpersistent antibacterial activity. In addition, high&#8208;efficiency organic antibacterial agents have yet to be employed in antibacterial PET due to their poor thermal stabilities. Herein, we describe a solid&#8208;state reaction for the upcycling of PET waste using a novel hyperthermostable antibacterial monomer. This reaction is catalyzed by the residual catalyst present in the PET waste. It was found that a catalytic amount of the antibacterial monomer enabled the low&#8208;cost upcycling of PET waste to produce high&#8208;value recycled PET with a strong and persistent antibacterial activity, as well as similar thermal properties to the virgin PET. This work provides a feasible and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste, and exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades was engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies were cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combined MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

Abstract
Cell therapies are emerging as a promising new therapeutic modality in medicine, generating effective treatments of previously incurable diseases. Clinical success of cell therapies has energized the field of cellular engineering, spurring further exploration of novel approaches to improve the therapeutic performance of cell therapies. Engineering of cell surfaces using natural and synthetic materials has emerged as a valuable tool in this endeavor. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of technologies for decorating cell surfaces with various materials including nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings, focusing on the ways in which surface decorations enhance carrier cells and therapeutic effects. Key benefits of these surface&#8208;modified cells include protecting the carrier cell, reducing particle clearance, enhancing cell trafficking, masking cell&#8208;surface antigens, modulating inflammatory phenotype of carrier cells, and delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. While most of these technologies are still in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, the promising therapeutic efficacy of these constructs from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has laid a strong foundation for further investigation for eventual clinical translation. Cell surface engineering with materials can imbue a diverse range of advantages for cell therapy, creating opportunities for innovative functionalities for improved therapeutic efficacy, and transforming the fundamental and translational landscape of cell therapies.

         <title>Unraveling Thermal Transport Correlated with Atomistic Structures in Amorphous Gallium Oxide via Machine Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials are crucial for their emerging applications in energy and electronic devices. However, understanding and controlling thermal transport in disordered materials remains an outstanding challenge, owing to the intrinsic limitations of computational techniques and the lack of physically&#8208;intuitive descriptors for complex atomistic structures. Here, we show how combining machine learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations can help to accurately describe realistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;property maps for disordered materials, which is illustrated by a practical application on gallium oxide. First, we report the experimental evidence to demonstrate that machine learning interatomic potentials, generated in a self&#8208;guided fashion with minimum quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, enable the accurate modeling of amorphous gallium oxide and its thermal transport properties. Our atomistic simulations then reveal the microscopic changes in the short&#8208;range and medium&#8208;range order with density and elucidate how these changes can reduce localization modes and enhance coherences&#8217; contribution to heat transport. Finally, a physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor for disordered phases is proposed, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form. This work might shed light on the future accelerated exploration of novel thermal transport properties and mechanisms in disordered functional materials.

         <title>Ethanol&#8208;induced Ni2+&#8208;intercalated Cobalt Organic Frameworks on Vanadium Pentoxide for Synergistically Enhancing the Performance of 3D&#8208;printed Micro&#8208;supercapacitors</title>

Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites with high energy density and excellent mechanical strength is limited by the degree of lattice matching and crystal surface structure. In this study, dodecahedral ZIF&#8208;67 was synthesized uniformly on vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The influence of the coordination mode on the surface of ZIF&#8208;67 in ethanol was also investigated. Benefitting from the different coordination abilities of Ni2+, Co2+, and N atoms, spatially separated surface&#8208;active sites were created through metal&#8208;ion exchange. Furthermore, the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure of ZIF&#8208;67 afforded the synthesis of hollow structures by controlling the amount of Ni doping. The formation of NiCo&#8208;MOF@CoOOH@V2O5 nanocomposites was confirmed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis. The high performance of the obtained composite was illustrated by fabricating a 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;supercapacitor, exhibiting a high area specific capacitance of 585 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 159.23 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 (at power density = 0.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The solvent/coordination tuning strategy demonstrated in this study provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Improved Liquid Collection on a Dual&#8208;asymmetric Superhydrophilic Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulating fluid with an open channel provides a promising strategy to simplify the current systems. Nevertheless, spontaneous on&#8208;surface fluid transport with large flux, high speed, and long distance remains challenging. Inspired by scallop shells, here we present a superhydrophilic origami with multiple&#8208;paratactic and dual&#8208;asymmetric channels to improve fluid collection. The origami channel can capture various types of liquids, including droplets, flow, and steam, and then transport collected liquid unidirectionally. The superhydrophilic origami with 2&#160;mm depth can reach maximum flux of 450&#160;mL/h, which is five times the capacity of flat patterned surface with similar dimension. To diversify the function of such interface, we further integrate the superhydrophilic origami with a superhydrophobic zirconium carbide/silicone coating for enhanced condensation via the collaboration of directional fluid manipulation and radiative cooling layer. Compared with the unmodified parallel origami, the shell&#8208;like origami with radiative cooling layer shows a 56% improvement in condensate efficiency as well as the directional liquid drainage. This work demonstrates a more accessible design for the optimization of on&#8208;surface fluid control, and the improved performance of liquid transport should extend the applications of bioinspired fluid&#8208;manipulating interfaces.

         <title>Iridescence from total internal reflection at 3D microscale interfaces: mechanistic insights and spectral analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This report describes the experimental investigation and optical modeling of the structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures. Ray tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of micro&#8208;geometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far&#8208;field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and greyscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence. The findings herein provide a robust conceptual framework for rationalizing this multibounce interference mechanism and establish approaches for characterizing and tailoring the optical and iridescent properties of microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in&#8208;situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anti&#8208;corrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2(4.3&#160;V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes towards high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices assembled from dispersed nanocrystals feature abundant geometries and unique optical properties, becoming intriguing study objects both for fundamental research and practical applications. A review covering packing models, functional capping ligands, synthetic methodologies, characterization technologies, optical fingerprints, and contemporary applications is presented. Outstanding issues and the&#160;perspective outlook&#160;are highlighted to inspire more research in this field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into superlattices is a fascinating process that not only changes geometric morphology, but also creates unique properties that considerably enrich the material toolbox for new applications. Numerous studies have driven the blossoming of superlattices from various aspects. These include precise control of size and morphology, enhancement of properties, exploitation of functions, and&#160;integration of the material into miniature devices. The effective synthesis of metal&#8211;halide perovskite nanocrystals has advanced research on self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into micrometer&#8208;sized superlattices. More importantly, these materials exhibit abundant optical features,&#160;including highly coherent superfluorescence, amplified spontaneous laser emission, and adjustable spectral redshift, facilitating basic research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices. It begins with basic packing models and introduces various stacking configurations of superlattices. The potential of multiple capping ligands is also discussed and their crucial role in superlattice growth is highlighted, followed by detailed reviews of synthesis and characterization methods. How these optical features can be distinguished and present contemporary applications is then considered. This review concludes with a list of unanswered questions and an outlook on their potential use in quantum computing and quantum communications to stimulate further research in this area.

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.








Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process.

&lt;p&gt;Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine-tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self-assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid-bearing material through the controlled-polymerization phase-separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality-induced force and the perpendicular substrate-anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re-absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti-sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human-like soft robotic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Reactions of Aryl Propiolic Acids via Decarboxylative Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling of aryl propiolic acids is herein&#160;presented as a new class of monomers on Ag(111). The coupling yielding poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) with high selectivity is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and supportive density functional theory calculations. Further, the selective formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic coordination bonds out of p&#8208;halogenated congeners is disclosed, which might&#160;enable new reactivity of Ag&#8208;adatoms.








Abstract
Aryl propiolic acids are introduced as a new class of monomers in the field of on&#8208;surface chemistry to build up poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) through decarboxylative Glaser coupling. As compared to aryl alkynes that are routinely used in the on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling, it is found that the decarboxylative coupling occurs at slightly lower temperature and with excellent selectivity. Activation occurs through decarboxylation for the propiolic acids, whereas the classical Glaser coupling is achieved through alkyne C&#63743;H activation, and this process shows poor selectivity. The efficiency of the decarboxylative coupling is documented by the successful polymerization of bis(propiolic acids) as monomers. It is also found that the new activation mode is compatible with aryl bromide functionalities, which allows the formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic polymers on the surface by chemoselective sequential reactions. All transformations are analyzed by a scanning tunneling microscope and are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;exchange Strategy towards BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy was developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8722; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Based Dexterous Artificial Motor Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the great advancement in designing diverse soft robots, they are not yet as dexterous as animals in many aspects. One challenge is that they still lack compact design of an artificial motor unit with a great comprehensive performance which can be conveniently fabricated, although many recently developed artificial muscles have shown excellent properties in one or two aspects. Herein, w e develop an artificial motor unit based on gold&#8208;coated ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) film. Subjected to a voltage, Joule heating generated by the gold film increases the temperature of the LCE film underneath and causes it to contract. Due to the small thermal inertial and electrically controlling method of the ultrathin LCE structure, its cyclic actuation speed is fast and controllable. W e show that under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit reaches 45%, strain rate is as high as 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W/kg. W e further demonstrate that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves like an actuator, a brake, or a nonlinear spring on demand, analogous to most animal muscles. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, w e demonstrate multiple highly dexterous artificial neuromuscular systems using the LCE&#8208;based motor unit.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: a Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode material for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed as layer&#8208;structured graphitic materials do and are difficult to accurately demonstrate. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interests to give a clear picture of their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to the sodium storage. In this review, we start by revisiting the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons, and then present our renewed understanding of their sodium storage mechanism, focusing especially on the critical low&#8208;potential plateaus. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superhigh sodium storage. We expect this review to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes engining the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, could cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about new opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrated the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) using a dihalides reduction strategy. The thickness can be as low as &#8764;6&#160;nm. Density functional theory calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process for ultrathin cobalt nanosheets. The as&#8208;grown cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh blocking temperature above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveals that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and could realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case study for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano&#8208;hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro&#8208;sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation was observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originate from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro&#8208;sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. Our superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.

         <title>User&#8208;Controlled 4D Biomaterial Degradation with Substrate&#8208;Selective Sortase Transpeptidases for Single&#8208;Cell Biology</title>

Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials show great promise for modelling disease dynamics ex vivo with spatiotemporal control over the cellular microenvironment. However, harvesting cells from such materials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state remains an outstanding challenge in 3D/4D culture and tissue engineering. In this manuscript, we introduce a fully enzymatic strategy for hydrogel degradation that affords spatiotemporal control over cell release while maintaining cytocompatibility. Exploiting engineered variants of the sortase transpeptidase evolved to recognize and selectively cleave distinct peptide sequences largely absent from the mammalian proteome, we sidestep many limitations implicit to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods to liberate cells from gels. We demonstrate that evolved sortase exposure has minimal impact on the global transcriptome of primary mammalian cells and that proteolytic cleavage proceeds with high specificity; incorporation of substrate sequences within hydrogel crosslinkers permits rapid and selective cell recovery with high viability. In composite multimaterial hydrogels, we show that sequential degradation of hydrogel layers enables highly specific retrieval of single&#8208;cell suspensions for phenotypic analysis. We expect that the high bioorthogonality and substrate selectivity of the evolved sortases will lead to their broad adoption as an enzymatic material dissociation cue and that their multiplexed use will enable newfound studies in 4D cell culture.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of snext&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) owning to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling bond&#8208;free surface and direct bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potentials to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based LEDs featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction on the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling, or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot &#8211; a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot &#8211; for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8208;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature, and compared to Hartree&#8208;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8208;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

&lt;p&gt;The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass-manufacturable, scaled-up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on-chip, in-between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling, or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short-to-intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot &#8211; a so-called jellybean quantum dot &#8211; for the prospects of acting as a qubit-qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing and magneto-spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature, and compared to Hartree-Fock multi-electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron-electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule.

         <title>Visualizing Catalytic Dynamics Process via Synchrotron Radiation Multi&#8208;Techniques</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The importance of catalysts today as workhorses in most modern industrial fields cannot be downplayed. As a result, rational design and engineering of targeted catalysts have emerged as key objectives and are dependent on in&#8208;depth understanding of complex catalytic dynamics, such as phase transformation, structural reconstruction, electronic evolution, and differentiation in surface and bulk. The synchrotron radiation (SR) light sources with rich advanced experimental methods are being recognized as a comprehensive characterization platform, which could draw a full picture on such multiparameter&#8208;involved catalysis under actual working conditions. Herein, we summarize the recent progress of catalytic dynamics process studied by the means of various SR&#8208;techniques. In particular, the SR&#8208;based spectroscopic, scattering and imaging investigations on true catalysts are firstly introduced with the potential of in situ and operando characterizations. Apparently, the limitations from single SR&#8208;technique naturally prompt a simple combination of SR&#8208;techniques to better understand the whole catalysis process. Moreover, the discrepancies among various online testing facilities and batches of samples, along with random/systematic errors introduced by traditional intermittent/asynchronous measurement make it imperative to develop more prolific system, complementary of multiple SR&#8208;techniques for deep probing of dynamic catalytic processes from atomic, molecular and electronic levels. We believe that booming new light sources will further enrich the current multiple SR&#8208;techniques by offering more synchronous (Femto&#8211;microsecond time scale in the same experiment), fine (&#8764;nm spatial resolution and &#8764;meV energy resolution) and real (actual atmosphere, pressure, temperature, etc.) catalytic conditions, and thus may realize the true visualization on future catalytic dynamic processes.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of Solid&#8208;state Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;state Lithium&#8208;sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attracted great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, we identify the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8208;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8208;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8208;S redox failure in SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343 Wh kg&#8211;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode-SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li-S redox in solid-state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion-restricted reaction media for reducing Li-S redox failure in SPE. It enables Ah-level solid-state Li-S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom-up improvement of solid-state Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Cu Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with alkaline and neutral electrolytes, using an acidic electrolyte for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) can significantly improve the carbon utilization efficiency. Herein, a Ni&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is developed for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction, which shows superior catalytic performance due to the electronic interaction between the Ni and the Cu. In particular, the carbon utilization efficiency increases from 33.0% to 64.3%.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO2 emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO2 utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO2 reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, the first work to design a Ni&#8211;Cu dual atom catalyst supported on hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is reported for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst shows a high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99% in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11, 225 &#177; 10, and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In particular, the CO2 utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice as high as that of alkaline conditions. Detailed study indicates the existence of electronic interaction between Ni and Cu atoms. The Cu atoms push the Ni d&#8208;band center further toward the Fermi level, thereby accelerating the formation of *COOH. In addition, operando characterizations and density functional theory calculation are used to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism of CO2 to CO under acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

         <title>Pore Perforation of Graphene Coupled with In Situ Growth of Co3Se4 for High&#8208;Performance Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to simultaneously achieve the perforation of graphene nanosheets and the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction, Co3Se4/holey&#160;graphene&#160;(Co3Se4/HG) as anode material exhibits remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D&#160;graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene&#8208;based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in&#8208;plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene&#8208;based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.

Based on the super&#8208;semiconducting metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays, this experiment realizes super&#8208;semiconductor&#160;p&#8208;n junction diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and a high breakdown field (&#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1). This research paves the way to develop ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, and power devices.








Abstract
Semiconductor devices are currently one of the most common energy consumption devices. Significantly reducing the energy consumption of semiconductor devices with advanced energy&#8208;efficient technologies is highly desirable. The discovery of super&#8208;semiconductors (SSCs) based on metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays provides an opportunity to realize ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power consumption semiconductor devices. As an example, the achievement of near zero&#8208;threshold voltage in p&#8208;n junction diodes based on super&#8208;semiconducting nanostructured Ag/Al arrays is reported, realizing ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power p&#8208;n junction diodes: &#8776;3&#160;W per trillion diodes with a working voltage of 1&#160;V or 30&#160;mW per trillion diodes with an operating voltage of 0.1 V. In addition, the p&#8208;n junction diodes exhibit a high breakdown field of &#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1, similar to that of SiC and GaN, due to a robust built&#8208;in field driven by infrared light photons. The SSC p&#8208;n diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and high breakdown field allow access to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, etc.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Crosslinked, Highly Entangled Hydrogels with Excellent Mechanical Properties but Ultra&#8208;Low Solid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully swollen hydrogel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%) but excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance, are successfully synthesized by combining two recently developed approaches.








Abstract
Low&#160;solid&#160;content&#160;is&#160;the&#160;ultimate&#160;reason&#160;for&#160;the&#160;brittleness&#160;and&#160;weakness of ordinary hydrogels. Here, hydrogels with ultra&#8208;low solid content but good mechanical properties are successfully synthesized using high monomer concentrations and low cross&#8208;linker/monomer ratios to obtain highly entangled structure&#160;and poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;based cross&#8208;linker&#160;to&#160;introduce&#160;peptide&#160;chains. Compared with hydrogel cross&#8208;linked with N,N'&#8208;methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), the peptide&#8208;crosslinked one has a larger swelling degree in water, leading to fully swollen gel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%). However, it still exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance. These properties are comparable to or even better than the BIS&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel, although&#160;the former has much lower solid content. The excellent mechanical properties of the peptide&#8208;crosslinked gel are attributed to its highly entangled structure and also to the introduction of a novel mechanism for energy dissipation, that is, energy dissipation via breakage of intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilizing the helical structure of the&#160;peptide.

         <title>Voltage Modulated Untwist Deformations and Multispectral Optical Effects from Ion Intercalation into Chiral Ceramic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Geometric reconfiguration of chiral ceramic nanostructures after ion intercalation should favor specific nanoscale twists that should lead to unusually strong chiroptical effects. Based on multifaceted experimental, simulation, and theoretical data, here we show that V2O3 nanoparticles have &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral distortions caused by multipoint binding of enantiomers of tartaric acid to the surface of inorganic core. As evidenced by spectroscopy/microscopy techniques and calculations of nanoscale chirality measures, the intercalation of Zn2+ ions into the V2O3 lattice results in particle expansion, untwist deformations and related decrease of chirality. Coherent deformations in the particle ensemble manifest as changes in sign and positions of multiple circular polarization bands at ultraviolet, visible, mid&#8208;, near&#8208; (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelengths originating in the electronic states of the surface ligands and the semiconductor cores. The g&#8208;factors observed for IR and NIR spectral diapasons are &#8764;100&#8208;400 times higher than those for previously reported dielectric, semiconductor and plasmonic nanoparticles. Nanocomposite films layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (LBL) from V2O3 nanoparticles reveal cyclic voltage&#8208;driven modulation of optical activity. Device prototypes for IR and NIR range problematic for liquid crystals and other organic materials, were demonstrated. High optical activity, synthetic simplicity, sustainable processability and environmental robustness of the chiral LBL nanocomposites provide a versatile platform for photonic devices. Similar reconfigurations of particle shapes are expected for multiple chiral ceramic nanostructures with a variety of optical, electrical, and magnetic properties.

         <title>Modular design of a polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft earthwormlike robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals which they mimic, most worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here we report a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments were designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation was used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in&#8208;situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging member of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit considerable advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the base of the switch behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V) and high transconductance (in mS range). During the past few years significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensing has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principle, materials and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <title>Functionalized Nanocomposite Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Strong Alkaline&#8208;Tolerance and High Zinc Anode Stability for Ultralong&#8208;Life Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries have attracted extensive interests, for which the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes. This study reports a sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability, endowing an ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h and high power output for the fabricated zinc&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Increasing pursuit of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics has put forward the demand of reliable energy devices with high flexibility, durability, and enhanced electrochemical performances. Flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (FAZABs) have attracted great interests owing to the high energy density, safety, and environmental benignity, for which quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, flexibility, and resistance to leakage problems of traditional liquid electrolytes. Compared to commonly used PVA&#8211;KOH electrolyte with poor electrolyte retention capability and cycling stability, a new type of sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE is applied in FAZABs with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability. Notably, the existence of (1) strong anionic sulfonate groups of QSGPEs, contributing to the exposure of preferred Zn (002) plane that is more resistant to zinc dendrite formation, and (2) nano&#8208;attapulgite electrolyte additives, beneficial for the enhancement of ionic conductivity, electrolyte uptake, and retention capability, endows a ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h for the fabricated FAZAB. Furthermore, flexible energy belts and knittable energy wires fabricated with a series/parallel unit of several FAZABs can be used to power various wearable electronics.

         <title>Tension&#8208;Induced Cavitation in Li&#8208;Metal Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping pathways controlled by the ratio of supporting solid structures (SSS) thickness to Li whisker radius are uncovered by in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). For whiskers with t/r ratio smaller than a critical value, Li0 strips via multisite cavitation with severe buckling and Li0 &#8220;trapping&#8221;; for whiskers with t/r ratio being larger than the critical value, Li0 undergoes planar stripping and negligible SSS buckling.








Abstract
Designing stable Li metal and supporting solid structures (SSS) is of fundamental importance in rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. Yet, the stripping kinetics of Li metal and its mechanical effect on the supporting solids (including solid electrolyte interface) remain mysterious to date. Here, through nanoscale in situ observations of a solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery in an electron microscope, two distinct cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping modes controlled by the ratio of the SSS thickness (t) to the Li deposit's radius (r) are discovered. A quantitative criterion is established to understand the damage tolerance of SSS on the Li&#8208;metal stripping pathways. For mechanically unstable SSS (t/r&#160;&lt; 0.21), the stripping proceeds via tension&#8208;induced multisite cavitation accompanied by severe SSS buckling and necking, ultimately leading to Li &#8220;trapping&#8221; or &#8220;dead Li&#8221; formation; for mechanically stable SSS (t/r&#160;&gt; 0.21), the Li metal undergoes nearly planar stripping from the root via single cavitation, showing negligible buckling. This work proves the existence of an electronically conductive precursor film coated on the interior of solid electrolytes that however can be mechanically damaged, and it is of potential importance to the design of delicate Li&#8208;metal supporting structures to high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioorthogonal Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of bioorthogonal catalysis is highly challenging owing to safety concerns of metal toxicity and low spatiotemporal regulation in vivo. Here, an intelligent Cu@PAA NCs&#160;catalyst is developed, the catalytic activity of which can be precisely regulated via valence state transformation between Cu(II) and Cu(I) under ultrasound irradiation, promoting off&#8208;target prodrug activation at lesion sites and generating ROS.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry, referring to the rapid and selective synthesis of imaging and/or therapeutic molecules in live animals via transition metal&#8208;mediated non&#8208;natural chemical transformation without disrupting endogenous reactions, has greatly expanded the tools and techniques for biomedicine. However, owing to safety concerns associated with metal toxicity, selectivity, sensitivity and stability, efficient bioorthogonal reactions that can be reliably executed in complex biological environments remain challenging. In this study, an intelligent, versatile bioorthogonal catalyst based on ultrasmall poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;modified copper nanocomplexes (Cu@PAA NCs) to achieve high spatiotemporal catalytic efficacy is established. The catalytic activity of the Cu@PAA NCs can be reversibly regulated via valence state interconversion between Cu(II) and Cu(I) under exogenous ultrasound irradiation, promoting off&#8208;target prodrug activation in lesion sites through the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Moreover, ultrasound&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation endows the Cu@PAA NCs with robust sonosensitizing ability for sonodynamic therapy. Furthermore, the Cu@PAA NCs exhibit enhanced contrast in magnetic resonance and photoacoustic imaging. Notably, the renal&#8208;clearable Cu@PAA NCs exhibit intrinsically benign biocompatibility. This spatiotemporally ultrasound&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalysis not only expands the repertoire of in situ therapeutic agents but also provides a new avenue for disease theranostics.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Cost&#8208;Effective Polymeric&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Based Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Linear Polarizers with Tailored Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Resonance</title>

Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur can replace expensive commercial semiconductors and chalcogenides for mid&#8208;wavelength infrared applications. Here, a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective polymeric&#8208;sulfur&#8208;based bilayer wire&#8208;grid linear polarizer with a pitch of 400&#160;nm is successfully demonstrated by systematically investigated thermal nanoimprinting conditions and precisely changed spacer thickness to control Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonance.








Abstract
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur has received considerable attention for application in waste&#8208;based infrared (IR) polarizers with high polarization sensitivities, owing to its high transmittance in the IR region and thermal processability. However, there have been few reports on highly sensitive polymeric sulfur&#8208;based polarizers by replication of pre&#8208;simulated dimensions to achieve a high transmission of the transverse magnetic field (TTM) and extinction ratio (ER). Herein, a 400&#8208;nanometer&#8208;pitch mid&#8208;wavelength infrared bilayer linear polarizer with self&#8208;aligned metal gratings is introduced on polymeric sulfur gratings integrated with a spacer layer (SM&#8208;polarizer). The dimensions of the SM&#8208;polarizer can be closely replicated using pre&#8208;simulated dimensions via a systematic investigation of thermal nanoimprinting conditions. Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin&#8208;coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize TTM in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM&#8208;polarizer yields TTM of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ER of 3.12 &#215; 103, 5.19 &#215; 103, and 5.81 &#215; 103 at 4&#160;&#181;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective SM&#8208;polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.

         <title>Architected Low&#8208;Tortuosity Electrodes with Tunable Porosity from Nonequilibrium Soft&#8208;Matter Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In energy storage devices, the microstructure of pores and materials is tied to performance. A material&#8208;agnostic process is reported to fabricate free&#8208;standing electrodes with adjustable thicknesses, featuring straight and accessible channels with homogenous diameters in the micrometer range, and tunable pore density. Through this scalable process, feature sizes can be tailored to inform and enable architectures for application&#8208;specific energy storage.








Abstract
Mass transport is performance&#8208;defining across energy storage devices, often causing limitations at high current rates. To optimize and balance the device&#8208;scale energy and power density for a given energy storage demand, tailored electrode architectures with precisely controllable phase dimensions are needed in combination with low&#8208;tortuosity channels that maximize the geometric component of diffusion and species flux. A material&#8208;agnostic nonequilibrium soft&#8208;matter process is reported to fabricate free&#8208;standing inorganic composite electrodes with adjustable thicknesses of 100s of&#160;&#181;m, featuring straight and accessible channels ranging in diameter from 5&#8211;30&#160;&#181;m, coupled with tunable material&#8208;to&#8208;pore ratios. Such architected anode and cathode electrodes exhibit electrochemical and architectural stability over extended cycling in a full&#8208;cell battery. Further, mass&#8208;transport constraints appear at high current densities, and the lithiation step is identified as rate&#8208;performance limiting, a result of insufficient lithium&#8208;ion supply and concentration polarization. The results demonstrate the need for and feasibility of tailored electrode architectures where dimensional ratios between low&#8208;tortuosity channels, the charge&#8208;storing matrix, and electrode thickness are tunable to meet coupled power and energy&#8208;storage requirements.

         <title>Entropy Stabilization Strategy for Enhancing the Local Structural Adaptability of Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability: no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. This leads to high stability of the capacity and voltage, greatly enhancing energy retention.








Abstract
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with high reversible energy densities are becoming prevalent. However, owing to the activation of low&#8208;potential redox couples and the progressively irreversible structural transformation caused by the local adjustment of transition&#8208;metal ions in the intra/interlayer driven by anionic redox, continuous capacity degradation, and voltage decay emerge, thus greatly reducing the energy density and increasing the difficulty of battery system management. Herein, layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability with no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. Consequently, the energy retention of the entropy&#8208;stabilization&#8208;strategy&#8208;enhanced Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is almost twice that of a typical Li&#8208;rich cathode material (Li1.20Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, T&#8208;LRM) after 3 months of cyclic testing. Moreover, when cycled at 1&#160;C, the voltage degradation per cycle is less than 0.02%, that is, it results in a voltage loss of only 0.8&#160;mV per cycle, which is excellent performance. This study paves the way for the development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with stabilized intralayer atomic arrangements and high local structural adaptability.

         <title>Rational Design of All&#8208;Inorganic Assemblies with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly route to achieve circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with both high anisotropic factor and photoluminescence quantum yield is developed. The excellent CPL performance arises from the efficient generation of linearly polarized luminescence from the aligned quantum nanorods and then transformation to CPL by an inorganic nanowire&#8208;based quarter&#8208;wave plate.








Abstract
Materials with exceptional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are important in multi&#8208;field applications such as 3D display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, spin electronics, etc. Although CPL properties have been widely investigated ranging from the traditional chiral organic molecules to the emerging chiral inorganic nanomaterials and their assemblies, a trade&#8208;off between the luminescence efficiency (quantum yield, &#981;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is always the bottleneck for all the chiral luminescent materials, which hinders their practical application. Herein, a new route to overcome the paradox through rationally assembling quantum nanorods and ultrathin inorganic nanowires into ordered multilayer structures is reported, achieving both high &#981; and glum. In these assembled structures, the aligned quantum nanorods emit linearly polarized light that is then transformed to CPL by the aligned ultrathin nanowire assemblies with precisely controlled phase retardation. This method is universal and readily extended to versatile 1D nanomaterials, paving the way for the practical applications of CPL active materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Responsive Upconversion Nanoprobe with Simultaneously Enhanced Single&#8208;Band Red Luminescence and Phase/Size Control for Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) (1532 nm) light responsive upconversion nanoparticles with enhanced single&#8208;band red upconversion emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Moreover, NIR&#8208;II light activated red upconversion bioimaging and photodynamic therapy are successfully achieved for the first time.








Abstract
Lanthanide based upconversion (UC) nanoprobes have emerged as promising agents for biological applications. Extending the excitation light to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II), instead of the traditional 980/808&#8201;nm light, and realizing NIR&#8208;II responsive single&#8208;band red UC emission is highly demanded for bioimaging application, which has not yet been explored. Here, a new type of NIR&#8208;II (1532&#160;nm) light responsive UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) with enhanced single&#8208;band red UC emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Through tuning the content of Mn2+ in NaLnF4:Er/Mn, the crystal phase, size, and emitting color are readily controlled, and the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) ratio is significantly increased from &#8776;20 to &#8776;300, leading to NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red emission via efficient energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by coating shell to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR&#8208;II light activated red UC bioimaging and photodynamic therapy through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine are successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR&#8208;II light responsive single&#8208;band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding Origins of Unusual Properties of Group IV Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding (MVB) is defined in the property space and its origin and distinction from resonant bonding and hyperconjugation are unclear. The essential electronic mechanisms of MVB are uncovered that involve bonding and antibonding pairwise interactions alternating along linear chains of at least five atoms, facilitating long&#8208;range electron transfer in response to polar fields that cause exotic properties.








Abstract
A distinct type of metavalent bonding (MVB) is recently proposed to explain an unusual combination of anomalous functional properties of group IV chalcogenide crystals, whose electronic mechanisms and origin remain controversial. Through theoretical analysis of evolution of bonding along continuous paths in structural and chemical composition space, emergence of MVB in rocksalt chalcogenides is demonstrated as a consequence of weakly broken symmetry of parent simple&#8208;cubic crystals of Group V metalloids. High electronic degeneracy at the nested Fermi surface of parent metal drives spontaneous breaking of its translational symmetry with structural and chemical fields, which open up a small energy gap and mediate strong coupling between conduction and valence bands making metavalent crystals highly polarizable, conductive, and sensitive to bond&#8208;lengths. Stronger symmetry&#8208;breaking structural and chemical fields, however, transform them discontinuously to covalent and ionic semiconducting states. MVB involves bonding&#8208;antibonding pairwise interactions alternating along linear chains of at least five atoms, which facilitate long&#8208;range electron transfer in response to polar fields causing unusual properties. The precise picture of MVB predicts anomalous second&#8208;order Raman scattering as an addition to set off their unusual properties, and will guide in design of new metavalent materials with improved thermoelectric, ferroelectric and nontrivial electronic topological properties.

         <title>Formation and Stabilization of NiOOH by Introducing &#945;&#8208;FeOOH in LDH: Composite Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owning to the strong electron&#8208;capturing and hydrogen&#8208;absorption capability of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH, NiOOH can be easily formedand stabilized in LDH, which exhibits highly efficient OER and UOR performance. 








Abstract
NiOOH is considered as the most active intermediate during electrochemical oxidation reaction, however, it is hard to directly synthesize due to high oxidation energy. Herein, theoretical calculations predict that &#945;&#8208;FeOOH enables a decline in formation energy and an improvement in stabilization of NiOOH in NiFe&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (LDH). Inspiringly, a composite composed of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH and LDH is well&#8208;designed and successfully fabricated in hydrothermal treatment by adding extra Fe3+ resource, and stable NiOOH is obtained by the following electro&#8208;oxidation method. Benefiting from strong electron&#8208;capturing capability of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH, it efficiently promotes charge redistribution around the Ni/Fe sites and activates Ni atoms of LDH, verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra (XAS). The d&#8208;band center is optimized that balances the absorption and desorption energy, and thus Gibbs free energy barrier is lowered dramatically toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and finally showing an outstanding overpotential of 195&#160;mV and a potential of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This study provides a novel strategy to construct highly efficient catalysts via the introduction of a new phase for complex multiple&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Large Harvested Energy by Self&#8208;Excited Liquid Suspension Triboelectric Nanogenerator with Optimized Charge Transportation Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator based on solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission, and dissipation effect for harvesting micro energy achieves the highest recorded charge density of non&#8208;contact mode TENG and 100% retention of the output for long&#8208;term operation cycles.








Abstract
To enhance the durability of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), liquid lubrication has been used to reduce mechanical abrasion. However, as the charge transportation behavior in dielectric liquid is not clearly understood, the output energy is still low although some improvements have been reported. Herein, the charge transportation behaviors in dielectric liquid by self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) are systematically investigated. The important role of solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission and dissipation effect, and the homogeneous dielectric induction effect in promoting its output performance is found. The LS&#8208;TENG with a dual dielectric tribolayer has advantages of slight driving force and long lifetime for harvesting micro energy. The output of LS&#8208;TENG remains almost constant for more than 234 k operating cycles. A high charge density of 704 &#181;C m&#8722;2 is obtained, 2.7 times as much as that of the current highest record in non&#8208;contact TENG. Additionally, the rotary LS&#8208;TENG lights up 4200 LEDs and continuously powers a variety of wireless sensors by harvesting wind energy at low wind speed. This work provides an important insight toward the charge transportation mechanism in dielectric liquid, and a prospective strategy for achieving highly robust TENG in micro energy harvesting for practical applications.

     alt="Large Harvested Energy by Self-Excited Liquid Suspension Triboelectric Nanogenerator with Optimized Charge Transportation Behavior"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator based on solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission, and dissipation effect for harvesting micro energy achieves the highest recorded charge density of non-contact mode TENG and 100% retention of the output for long-term operation cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the durability of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), liquid lubrication has been used to reduce mechanical abrasion. However, as the charge transportation behavior in dielectric liquid is not clearly understood, the output energy is still low although some improvements have been reported. Herein, the charge transportation behaviors in dielectric liquid by self-excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator (LS-TENG) are systematically investigated. The important role of solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission and dissipation effect, and the homogeneous dielectric induction effect in promoting its output performance is found. The LS-TENG with a dual dielectric tribolayer has advantages of slight driving force and long lifetime for harvesting micro energy. The output of LS-TENG remains almost constant for more than 234 k operating cycles. A high charge density of 704 &#181;C m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained, 2.7 times as much as that of the current highest record in non-contact TENG. Additionally, the rotary LS-TENG lights up 4200 LEDs and continuously powers a variety of wireless sensors by harvesting wind energy at low wind speed. This work provides an important insight toward the charge transportation mechanism in dielectric liquid, and a prospective strategy for achieving highly robust TENG in micro energy harvesting for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling in Atomically Thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A space&#8208;confined CVD strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature ferrimagnetism. The strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. The robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with magnetoelectric coupling combine the magnetic order and electric polarization in a single phase, providing a cornerstone for constructing high&#8208;density information storages and low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption spintronic devices. The strong interactions between various order parameters are crucial for realizing such multifunctional applications, nevertheless, this criterion is rarely met in classical 2D materials at room&#8208;temperature. Here an ingenious space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin non&#8208;layered &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic order. Interestingly, the strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are unambiguously discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. More significantly, the robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of the controllable synthesis of 2D multiferroics with robust magnetoelectric coupling, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical applications in low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption electric&#8208;writing/magnetic&#8208;reading devices.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity in the Electroproduction of H2O2 via F/S Dual&#8208;Doping in Metal&#8208;Free Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free nanofibers are engineered as large&#8208;scale electrocatalysts for H2O2 production. Optimized sample yields an onset potential of 0.814 V versus RHE and almost an ideal 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 99.1%. Theoretical computations and experiments demonstrate that the enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR performances stem from the intermolecular charge transfer coupled with electron spin redistribution effect contributed by the fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is attracting broad interest in diversified areas including paper manufacturing, wastewater treatment, production of liquid fuels, and public sanitation. Current efforts focus on researching low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and sustainable electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity. Here a large&#8208;scale H2O2 electrocatalysts based on metal&#8208;free carbon fibers with a fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping strategy is engineered. Optimized samples yield with a high onset potential of 0.814 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an almost ideal 2e&#8722; pathway selectivity of 99.1%, outperforming most of the recently reported carbon&#8208;based or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First principle theoretical computations and experiments demonstrate that the intermolecular charge transfer coupled with electron spin redistribution from fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping is the crucial factor contributing to the enhanced performances in 2e&#8722; ORR. This work opens the door to the design and implementation of scalable, earth&#8208;abundant, highly selective electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and other catalytic fields of industrial&#160;interest.

         <title>BSA&#8208;AIE Nanoparticles with Boosted ROS Generation for Immunogenic Cell Death Immunotherapy of Multiple Myeloma</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn) by loading AIE photosensitizers into BSA nanoparticles is developed for multiple myeloma immunotherapy. BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn&#160;could induce an effective ICD process, leading to&#160;dentric cell maturation, T cell activation, and tumor infiltration of T cells. Intriguingly, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn has the potential to reverse T cell senescence, which plays vital roles in MM therapy.








Abstract
The main obstacle of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy is the compromised immune microenvironment, which leads to MM relapses and extramedullary disease progression. In this study, a novel strategy is reported of enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) immunotherapy with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (referred as BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn), which can activate T cells, convert the cold tumor to hot, and reverse T cell senescence to restore the immune microenvironment for MM treatment. Loading AIE photosensitizer into the hydrophobic domain of BSA proteins significantly immobilizes the molecular geometry, which massively increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and elicits a promising ICD immune response. Employing a NOD&#8208;SCID IL&#8208;2receptor gamma null mice model with MM patients&#8217; monocytes, it is shown that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can simulate human dentric cell maturation, activate functional T lymphocytes, and increase additional polarization and differentiation signals to deliver a promising immunotherapy performance. Intriguingly, for the first time, it is shown that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can greatly reverse T cell senescence, a main challenge in treating MM. Additionally, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can effectively recruit more functional T lymphocytes into MM tumor. As a consequence, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn restores MM immune microenvironment and shows the best MM tumor eradication performance, which shall pave new insights for MM treatment in clinical practices.

         <title>In Situ Endothelialization of Free&#8208;Form 3D Network of Interconnected Tubular Channels via Interfacial Coacervation by Aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;Aqueous Embedded Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endothelialized liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid architectures are presented by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) embedded bioprinting strategy. The interfacial coacervation of aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) is exploited for maintaining liquid architectures and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell growth. The free&#8208;form 3D networks of interconnected endothelium lumens suspended in liquids can be significant for generating functional tissues. 








Abstract
The challenge of bioprinting vascularized tissues is structure retention and in situ endothelialization. The issue is addressed by adopting an aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;aqueous 3D embedded bioprinting strategy, in which the interfacial coacervation of the cyto&#8208;mimic aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) are employed for maintaining the suspending liquid architectures, and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. By incorporating endothelial cells in the ink phase of ATPS, tubular lumens enclosed by coacervated complexes of polylysine (PLL) and oxidized bacteria celluloses (oxBC) can be cellularized with a confluent endothelial layer, without any help of adhesive peptides. By applying PLL/oxBC ATPS for embedded bioprinting, free&#8208;form 3D vascular networks with in situ endothelialization of interconnected tubular lumens are achieved. This simple approach is a one&#8208;step process without any sacrificed templates and post&#8208;treatments. The resultant functional vessel networks with arbitrary complexity are suspended in liquid medium and can be conveniently handled, opening new routes for the in vitro production of thick vascularized tissues for pathological research, regeneration therapy and animal&#8208;free drug development.

The issue is addressed by adopting an aqueous-in-aqueous 3D embedded bioprinting strategy, in which the interfacial coacervation of the cyto-mimic aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) are employed for maintaining the suspending liquid architectures, and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. By incorporating endothelial cells in the ink phase of ATPS, tubular lumens enclosed by coacervated complexes of polylysine (PLL) and oxidized bacteria celluloses (oxBC) can be cellularized with a confluent endothelial layer, without any help of adhesive peptides. By applying PLL/oxBC ATPS for embedded bioprinting, free-form 3D vascular networks with in situ endothelialization of interconnected tubular lumens are achieved. This simple approach is a one-step process without any sacrificed templates and post-treatments. The resultant functional vessel networks with arbitrary complexity are suspended in liquid medium and can be conveniently handled, opening new routes for the in vitro production of thick vascularized tissues for pathological research, regeneration therapy and animal-free drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed 2D P&#8208;Type WSe2 Transistors and Circuits through Molecular Doping</title>

         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type WSe2 thin&#8208;film transistor is successfully fabricated by Br2&#8208;doping with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107. The resulting complementary inverters with patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films reaches an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V.








Abstract
Semiconducting ink based on 2D single&#8208;crystal flakes with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces enables the implementation of high&#8208;performance devices on form&#8208;free substrates by cost&#8208;effective and scalable printing processes. However, the lack of solution&#8208;processed p&#8208;type 2D semiconducting inks with high mobility is an obstacle to the development of complementary integrated circuits. Here, a versatile strategy of doping with Br2 is reported to enhance the hole mobility by orders of magnitude for p&#8208;type transistors with 2D layered materials. Br2&#8208;doped WSe2 transistors show a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107, and exhibits excellent operational stability during the on&#8208;off switching, cycling, and bias stressing testing. Moreover, complementary inverters composed of patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V. This work unveils the high potential of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors with low&#8208;temperature processability for flexible devices and monolithic circuitry.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on the Comprehensive Integration and Synergetic Utilization of Triboelectrification, Electrostatic Induction, and Electrostatic Discharge to Achieve Alternating Current/Direct Current Convertible Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, a brand&#8208;new energy converter paradigm is achieved. The dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator can produce an alternating current/direct current convertible output by adjusting the slider motion state, generating a remarkable constant output current and power density of 1.51 mA m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 and 398 mW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Traditional alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which are implemented via the pairwise coupling of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, have been widely explored in various fields. In this work, the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge in a single device for the first time is realized, achieving a dual&#8208;functional TENG (DF&#8208;TENG) to produce an AC/DC convertible output. Distinguishing from the conventional TENGs, the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic discharge enables charge circulation between the dielectric tribo&#8208;layers, while electrostatic induction realizes charge transfer in the external circuit. This novel energy conversion mechanism has been proven to be applicable to a variety of materials, including polymers, fabrics, and semiconductors. The output mode of the DF&#8208;TENG can be tuned by adjusting the slider motion state, and its constant output current and power density can reach 1.51 mA m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 and 398 mW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, respectively, which are the highest records reported for constant DC&#8208;TENGs to date. This work not only provides a paradigm shift to achieve AC/DC convertible output, but it also exhibits high potential for extending the TENG design philosophy.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs) with room&#8208;temperature closed&#8208;loop recyclability are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in strong and stiff thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductility and toughness, as well as reprocessability and rehealability. The mechanical properties of the supra&#8208;CANs are superior to those of strong and tough commodity polycarbonate.








Abstract
Development of closed&#8208;loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in daily life can be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy&#8208;to&#8208;recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely, supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs), is reported, which not only displays mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate, but also exhibits excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra&#8208;CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogs that do not have noncovalent crosslinks (CANs) show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra&#8208;CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer&#8208;monomer&#8208;polymer circulation. This work provides new design principles for high&#8208;performance chemically recyclable polymers as sustainable substitutes for the conventional plastics.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified Enzyodynamic Tumor Therapy by Perovskite Nanoenzyme&#8208;Enabled Cell Pyroptosis and Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound&#8208;amplified enzyodynamic therapy has been developed to heighten the rate/degree of deleterious reactive oxygen species generation for inducing the pyroptosis of breast cancer cells, which is based on the advanced catalytic perovskite nanoenzyme.








Abstract
Overcoming apoptosis resistance to achieve efficient breast cancer treatment remains a challenge. The precise induction of another form of programmed cell death, pyroptosis, is an excellent alternative for treating cancer. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic (enzyodynamic) therapy is developed by employing LaFeO3 (LFO) perovskite nanocrystals as a substrate to increase the rate of deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for intensive cell pyroptosis. LFO nanocrystals possess quadruple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which undertake the dominant therapeutic task through cascade catalytic reactions, including the reversal of hypoxic microenvironment, depletion of endogenous glutathione, and continuous output of ROS. US exogenous stimulation increases the transition rate of the intermediate complex to Fe (II) and favors incremental ROS production, by which the ROS burst&#8208;induced pyroptosis process is accomplished through the ROS&#8208;TXNIP&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic outcomes affirm the ascendancy of LFO nanozyme&#8208;induced pyroptosis. This work highlights the critical role of US coupled with nanocatalytic reactors in pyroptosis&#8208;dominant breast cancer treatment with the apoptosis resistance circumvention feature.

Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic outcomes affirm the ascendancy of LFO nanozyme-induced pyroptosis. This work highlights the critical role of US coupled with nanocatalytic reactors in pyroptosis-dominant breast cancer treatment with the apoptosis resistance circumvention feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ternary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency up to 18.14% Employing a Two&#8208;Step Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>

In this work, well&#8208;designed polymer acceptor materials for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) processing are combined with a ternary strategy to improve the active layer morphology. The optimized LbL&#8208;type ternary system not only shows the best efficiency of 18.14% among the all&#8208;polymer solar cells but also exhibits insensitivity to the active layer thickness ranging from 82&#8211;180 nm.








Abstract
Achieving a finely tuned active layer morphology with a suitable vertical phase to facilitate both charge generation and charge transport has long been the main goal for pursuing the highly efficient bulk heterojunction all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, a solution to address the above challenge via synergistically combining the ternary blend strategy and the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) procedure is proposed. By introducing a synthesized polymer acceptor (PA), PY&#8208;Cl, with higher crystallinity into the designed host acceptor PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V, vertical phase distribution and molecular ordering of the LbL&#8208;type ternary all&#8208;PSCs can be improved in comparison to the LbL&#8208;type PM6/PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V binary all&#8208;PSCs. The formation of the superior bulk microstructure can not only promote charge transport and extraction properties but also reduce energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, thus improving all three photovoltaic parameters simultaneously. Consequently, the PM6/(PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V:PY&#8208;Cl) ternary all&#8208;PSCs show the best efficiency of 18.14%, which is among the highest values reported to date for all&#8208;PSCs. This work provides a facile and effective LbL&#8208;type ternary strategy for obtaining high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Pushing the Limit of Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Deficit via Modifying Buried Interface in CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a multifunctional optimization strategy based on employing 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salt to modify the buried interface of TiO2 and adjacent perovskite is demonstrated. Benefitting from the suppressed charge recombination loss and decreased energetic mismatch, the target CsPbI3&#8208;based device delivers an efficiency of 20.98% and a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451 V.








Abstract
Although CsPbI3 perovskites have shown tremendous potential in the photovoltaic field owing to their excellent thermal stability, the device performance is seriously restricted by severe photovoltage loss. The buried titanium oxide/perovskite interface plays a critical role in interfacial charge transport and perovskite crystallization, which is closely related to open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit stemming from nonradiative recombination. Herein, target molecules named 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salts are deliberately employed with special functional groups for modifying the buried interface, giving rise to favorable functions in terms of passivating interfacial defects, optimizing energetic alignment, and facilitating perovskite crystallization. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the buried interface modification inhibits the electron transfer barrier and simultaneously improves perovskite crystal quality, thereby reducing trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination and interfacial energetic loss. Consequently, the omnibearing modification regarding the buried interface endows the devices with an impressive efficiency of 20.98%, achieving a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451&#160;V. The as&#8208;proposed buried interface modification strategy renders with a universal prescription to push the limit of VOC deficit, showing a promising future in developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Liesegang Phenomenon of Liquid Metals on Au Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomena and mechanisms for achieving Liesegang patterns of spatially recurrent crystallization through gallium (Ga)&#8208;based liquid metal clusters dabbed onto the gold (Au) film have been disclosed. During the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading process of Ga&#8208;based liquid metal clusters on Au film, the chemical reactions occur simultaneously, accompanied by the crystallization of intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2.








Abstract
Room temperature liquid metals (LM) such as gallium (Ga) own the potential to react with specific materials which would incubate new application categories. Here, diverse self&#8208;organized ring patterns due to nonequilibrium reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limitation of Ga&#8208;based LM clusters on gold (Au) film are reported, among which diffusion is the controlling step and the self&#8208;limiting oxide layer plays the role of kinetic barrier. Such phenomena, classically known as the Liesegang rings, mainly occur in electrolyte media. Unlike existing systems, the present periodic crystallization mechanism enables highly symmetric spatiotemporal periodic Liesegang rings on a smaller scale under ambient conditions. Typically, the Ga&#8208;Au and eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn)&#8208;Au reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading systems are constructed, obtaining the revert type and hybrid type concentric Liesegang patterns, respectively. The competitive patterning behavior of the intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2 in hybrid Liesegang patterns is further analyzed by altering the initial Ga/In mass ratio, first&#8208;principles calculations, and molecular dynamic simulations. When the mass ratio of In in GaIn alloy exceeds 15%, it will preferentially react with Au. The discovery of LM Liesegang phenomenon is expected to be a flashpoint for self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems and offers promising rules for diverse areas such as materials synthesis and the jewelry design industry.

         <title>Scalable Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron/Nickel Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
Combining the electrochemical reactions and the redox&#8208;mediated chemical reaction, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with energy density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and the upscaling of kW&#8208;scale stack with a high performance for 600&#160;h are demonstrated, which will inspire the development of next&#8208;generation cost&#8208;effective flow batteries based on novel redox chemistries for electrochemical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving net&#8208;zero emissions requires low&#8208;cost and reliable energy storage devices that are essential to deploy renewables. Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries such as alkaline zinc&#8208;iron (or nickel) flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their high safety, high efficiency, and low cost. Nevertheless, their energy density is limited by the low solubility of ferro/ferricyanide and the limited areal capacity of sintered nickel electrodes. Here, combining the electrochemical reaction with the chemical reaction of ferro/ferricyanide couple in a homemade nickel electrode, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with a high energy density of 208.9&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 84.7% at a high current density of 80&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is reported. The reversible chemical reactions between dual couples are proven to stabilize the nickel electrode by promoting the activation of the nickel electrode and further preventing the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. A kW&#8208;scale stack is demonstrated by the integration of ferro/ferricyanide couple with nickel electrode, delivering a coulombic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 89% at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates a promising pathway for constructing and upscaling flow batteries with high energy density and low cost.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;Standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and motion remains challenging in autonomous systems. Harnessing wavy ribbon rings for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer rings under constant temperature and light are reported. It drives continuous flipping for either periodic self&#8208;dancing in place in symmetric rings or self&#8208;crawling in asymmetric rings on the ground and underwater, as well as self&#8208;escaping from confined spaces.








Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation are reported. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and underwater. The 3D, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. It is found that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, it is shown that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

         <title>Autonomous Soft Robots Empowered by Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a pH&#8208;flip based on a self&#8208;decarboxylating acid, transient control of a soft actuator is achieved. This method of control allows for tuning of actuation amplitude and duration, and can be coupled to further reactions for more complex self&#8208;regulation. Autonomous operation and unique &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; time&#8208;programmed applications are demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogel actuators are important for designing stimuli&#8208;sensitive soft robots. They generate mechanical motion by exploiting compartmentalized (de)swelling in response to a stimulus. However, classical switching methods, such as manually lowering or increasing the pH, cannot provide more complex autonomous motions. By coupling an autonomously operating pH&#8208;flip with programmable lifetimes to a hydrogel system containing pH&#8208;responsive and non&#8208;responsive compartments, autoonenomous forward and backward motion as well as more complex tasks, such as interlocking of &#8220;puzzle pieces&#8221; and collection of objects are realized. All operations are initiated by one simple trigger, and the devices operate in a &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; mode. More complex self&#8208;regulatory behavior is obtained by adding chemo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemo feedback mechanisms. Due to its simplicity, this method shows great potential for the autonomous operation of soft grippers and metamaterials.

         <title>Dilute Alloying to Implant Activation Centers in Nitride Electrocatalysts for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilute alloying implants &#8220;activating&#8221; centers in nitride alloy electrocatalysts to boost lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Dilute Co dopants activate the surrounding N and Ti atoms to construct multiatom active domains for efficient bidirectional catalysis of S redox reactions. The corresponding dilute nitride alloy improves the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but is rarely leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants are demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying is shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enables onefold increase in the high rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as an impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mgS cm&#8722;2. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain&#8208;catalyzed reactions in energy applications.

         <title>Delicate Co&#8208;Control of Shell Structure and Sulfur Vacancies in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Tungsten Disulfide Hollow Sphere for Fast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has been fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of rechargeable batteries. Herein, delicate co&#8208;control over multiscale structures of HoMS is reported, specifically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8722;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is developed. Benefiting from its plentiful sodium ion storage sites, prompted charge diffusion and improved structural stability, WS2&#8722;x HoMS exhibits an excellent sodium storage performance.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is a promising multi&#8208;functional platform for energy storage, owing to its unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property and buffering function. Accurate co&#8208;control of its multiscale structures may bring fascinating properties and new opportunities, which is highly desired yet rarely achieved due to the challenging synthesis. Herein, a sequential sulfidation and etching approach is developed to achieve the delicate co&#8208;control over both molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;scale structure of WS2&#8722;x HoMS. Typically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8722;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is obtained from triple&#8208;shelled WO3 HoMS. By further coating with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, WS2&#8722;x HoMS maintains a reversible capacity of 241.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles for sodium storage, which is superior to the previously reported results. Mechanism analyses reveal that HoMS provides good electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact and plentiful sodium storage sites as well as an effective buffer of the stress/strain during cycling; sulfur vacancy and expanded interlayer of WS2&#8722;x enhance ion diffusion kinetics; carbon coating improves the electron conductivity and benefits the structural stability. This finding offers prospects for realizing practical fast&#8208;charging, high&#8208;energy, and long&#8208;cycling sodium storage.

         <title>Bidirectional Water&#8208;Stream Behavior on a Multifunctional Membrane for Simultaneous Energy Generation and Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).








Abstract
Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy&#8208;generation performance and long&#8208;term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

&lt;p&gt;Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water-streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy-generation performance and long-term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &amp;gt;90% rejection of sub-10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next-generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Immunostimulatory Pathway Agonism through a Synthetic Nanocarrier Triggers Robust Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity in Murine Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here immune stimulants delivered via this new platform called cyclodextrin&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle dual immunotherapy (CANDI) are shown to effectively target myeloid cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) mouse models, and reverse immune suppression. This immunotherapy turns the &#8220;cold&#8221; GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) into a &#8220;hot&#8221; T cell inflamed TME, and leads to significant survival benefits in GBM.








Abstract
Myeloid cells are abundant, create a highly immunosuppressive environment in glioblastoma (GBM), and thus contribute to poor immunotherapy responses. Based on the hypothesis that small molecules can be used to stimulate myeloid cells to elicit anti&#8208;tumor effector functions, a synthetic nanoparticle approach is developed to deliver dual NF&#8208;kB pathway&#8208;inducing agents into these cells via systemic administration. Synthetic, cyclodextrin&#8208;adjuvant nanoconstructs (CANDI) with high affinity for tumor&#8208;associated myeloid cells are dually loaded with a TLR7 and 8 (Toll&#8208;like receptor, 7 and 8) agonist (R848) and a cIAP (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein) inhibitor (LCL&#8208;161) to dually activate these myeloid cells. Here CANDI is shown to: i) readily enter the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) and accumulate at high concentrations, ii) is taken up by tumor&#8208;associated myeloid cells, iii) potently synergize payloads compared to monotherapy, iv) activate myeloid cells, v) fosters a &#8220;hot&#8221; TME with high levels of T effector cells, and vi) controls the growth of murine GBM as mono&#8208; and combination therapies with anti&#8208;PD1. Multi&#8208;pathway targeted myeloid stimulation via the CANDI platform can efficiently drive anti&#8208;tumor immunity in GBM.

         <title>Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208; and Power&#8208;Density Zinc Batteries and Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dibetaine zinc(II) complex with additional weakly coordinating acetonitrile ligands proves to be an excellent electrolyte for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based rechargeable batteries and ion capacitors. It efficiently prevents dendrite formation on the electrode and allows almost degradation&#8208;free, efficient long&#8208;term cycling at high voltage, and very high currents.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, limited coulombic efficiency (CE), and the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes restrict the commercialization of zinc batteries and capacitors. These issues are resolved by a new electrolyte, based on the zinc(II)&#8211;betaine complex [Zn(bet)2][NTf2]2. Solutions in acetonitrile (AN) avoid dendrite formation. A Zn||Zn cell operates stably over 10 110 h (5055 cycles) at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2 or 110 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, and has an area capacity of 113 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 80% depth of discharge. A zinc&#8211;graphite battery performs at 2.6 V with a midpoint discharge&#8208;voltage of 2.4 V. The capacity&#8208;retention at 3 A g&#8722;1 (150 C) is 97% after 1000 cycles and 68% after 10&#160;000 cycles. The charge/discharge time is about 24 s at 3.0 A g&#8722;1 with an energy density of 49 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 6864 W kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode. A zinc||activated&#8208;carbon ion&#8208;capacitor (coin cell) exhibits an operating&#8208;voltage window of 2.5 V, an energy density of 96 Wh kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 610 W kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. At 12 A g&#8722;1, 36 Wh kg&#8722;1, and 13&#160;600 W kg&#8722;1 are achieved with 90% capacity&#8208;retention and an average CE of 96% over 10&#160;000 cycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical methods and vibrational spectroscopy reveal [Zn(bet)2(AN)2]2+ as the dominant complex in the electrolyte.

         <title>Multiple Fusion Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Yellow OLEDs with Full Width at Half Maximums Down to 23&#160;nm and External Quantum Efficiencies up to 37.4%</title>

         <dc:description>
Toward the goal of ideal narrowband yellow emission, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;fusion&#8221; design strategy is proposed to break the trade&#8208;off between spectral redshift and broadening. The corresponding electroluminescent device exhibits leading performance in yellow multi&#8208;resonance (MR) devices, with peak efficiencies of 37.4%, 136.6 cd A&#8722;1, and 119.2 lm W&#8722;1 and FWHM of only 23 nm.








Abstract
The pursuit of ideal narrowband yellow multiple resonance (MR) emitters is hampered by the mutual constraints of effective spectral redshift and maintaining a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) value. Here, a novel multiple fusion molecular design strategy is reported to break this trade&#8208;off. Compared with the selected narrowband parent core, the specific multiple MR effects in target molecules can simultaneously extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length, increase the rigidity of the structure, and reduce the vibrational frequency. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters BN&#8208;DICz and DBN&#8208;ICz show bright yellowish green to yellow emissions in dilute toluene solutions with peaks at 533&#8211;542&#160;nm and extremely small FWHMs of &#8804;20&#160;nm. Notably, BN&#8208;DICz&#8208;based electroluminescent device exhibits excellent efficiencies of 37.4%, 136.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and 119.2&#160;lm W&#8722;1 with an FWHM of merely 23&#160;nm, representing the best performance for yellow MR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

A perfect transparent conductor in the visible range will display 100% transmission in the corresponding wavelength range (black dotted curve). What the engineered advanced conducting perovskite SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3 can do, is indicated by the red dotted curve.

SrMoO3 , SrNbO3, and SrVO3 are remarkable highly conducting d1 (V, Nb) or d2 (Mo) perovskite metals with an intrinsically high transparency in the visible. A key scientific question is how the optical properties of these materials can be manipulated to make them suitable for applications as transparent electrodes and in plasmonics. Here, it is shown how 3d/4d cationic substitution in perovskites tailors the relevant materials parameters, i.e., optical transition energy and plasma frequency. With the example of the solid&#8208;state solution SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3, it is shown that the absorption and reflection edges can be shifted to the edges of the visible light spectrum, resulting in a material that has the potential to outperform indium tin oxide (ITO) due to its extremely low sheet resistance. An optimum for x&#160;= 0.5, where a resistivity of 32&#160;&#181;&#937; cm (&#8776;12&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1) is paired with a transmittance above 84% in the whole visible spectrum is found. Quantitative comparison between experiments and electronic structure calculations show that the shift of the plasma frequency is governed by the interplay of d&#8208;band filling and electronic correlations. This study advances the knowledge about the peculiar class of highly conducting perovskites toward sustainable transparent conductors and emergent plasmonics.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Level Asymmetric Mesochannels for Coupled Accelerated Dual&#8208;Ion Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/AAO/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) with dual&#8208;ion selective layers is constructed by super&#8208;assembly strategy. The special structure endows it with gating, storing and releasing performance. Importantly, the couple of MC and MS in MC/AAO/MS nanochannels endow it with enhanced cation selectivity and osmotic energy conversion performance.








Abstract
Asymmetric nanofluidic devices hold great potential in energy conversion applications. However, most of the existing asymmetric nanofluidic devices remain a single&#8208;level asymmetric structure and a single&#8208;ion selective layer, which results in weak ion selectivity and limited energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/anodized aluminum/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) nanofluidic device with abundant and ordered mesochannels is constructed from super&#8208;assembly strategy. The resultant MC/AAO/MS exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport and outstanding ion storage&#8208;release performance. Importantly, MC/AAO/MS couples the MC and MS dual&#8208;ion selective layers, which ensures a high ionic conductance and evidently enhances the cation selectivity. Thereby, the MC/AAO/MS demonstrates ascendant salinity gradient energy conversion performance. The power density and conversion efficiency can reach up to 5.37&#160;W m&#8722;2 and 32.79%, respectively. Noteworthy, a good energy conversion performance of 63&#160;mW m&#8722;2 can still be achieved upon high working area, outperforming 300% of the performance of MC/AAO and MS/AAO single&#8208;level asymmetric nanochannels. Theoretical calculation further verifies that the multi&#8208;level asymmetric structure and dual&#8208;ion selective transport are the reason for the enhanced cation selectivity and energy conversion efficiency. This work opens a new avenue for constructing multi&#8208;level asymmetric structured nanofluidic devices for various applications.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Synthetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired strategy is developed for the synthesis of robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). These HOFs not only exhibit high stability in strong acids or bases but also have a high proton conductivity due to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds. This study demonstrates that the precise structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the understanding of structure&#8208;performance correlations.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a rising class of promising proton&#8208;conducting materials. However, they always suffer from the inherent contradiction between chemical stability and proton conduction. Herein, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, a series of aminomethylphosphonic acid&#8208;derived single&#8208;component HOFs are successfully developed with different substituents attached to the phosphonate oxygen group. They remain highly stable in strong acid or alkaline water solutions for one month owing to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, in the absence of external proton carriers, the methyl&#8208;substituted phosphonate&#8208;based HOF exhibits a very high proton conductivity of up to 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;&#176;C and 98% relative humidity. This value is not only comparable to that of HOFs consisting of mixed ligands but also is the highest reported in single&#8208;component HOFs. A combination of single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations reveals that the high conductivity is attributed to the strengthened H&#8208;bonding interactions between positively charged amines and negatively charged phosphonate groups in the channel of bio&#8208;inspired HOFs. This finding demonstrates that the well&#8208;defined molecular structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the precise understanding of the relationship between structure and property.

         <title>Wearable Triboelectric Visual Sensors for Tactile Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a self&#8208;powered wearable visual tactile sensor is developed, which realized the portability of wearable devices. The tactile information is readily converted into visible light signals (9.8&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) owing to the high&#8208;power density (2.1 W m&#8722;2) of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which is 4.4&#160;times higher than the output performance of the vertical contact&#8208;separation type TENG.








Abstract
Tactile sensors with visible light feedback functions, such as wearable displays and electronic skin and biomedical devices, are becoming increasingly important in various fields. However, existing methods cannot meet the application requirements for the tactile perception of intensity feedback and extended intersection due to their limited light&#8208;mapping performance and insufficient portability. Herein, a freely constructible self&#8208;powered visual tactile sensor is proposed, which consists of a high&#8208;output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a visual light source. The transferred charge of the TENG is enhanced to 746 nC by the structural design of the triboelectric material and device, which can easily drive the light source to generate a light signal with a brightness of 9.8 cd m&#8722;2. Notably, the application of the TENG enables to realization visual sensing of the palm&#8208;grasp state and strength feedback without an external power supply. This visual feedback and power&#8208;free tactile sensors are expected to have potential application in the field of artificial intelligence as a new interactive medium for smart protective clothing and robotics.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP) allows the synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with a continuous size gradient. Subsequent self&#8208;assembly into a photonic glass results in a thin film with a continuous photonic gradient and structural colors ranging over the full visible spectrum. This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non&#8208;gradient&#160;mixture.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non-gradient&#160;mixture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom-up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self-assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle-based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile and Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donor Based on 4&#8208;Chlorothiazole for Highly Efficient Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and low&#8208;cost 4&#8208;chlorothiazole&#8208;based polymer donor PBTTz3Cl is designed and synthesized. PBTTz3Cl not only exhibits excellent photovoltaic performances with various small molecule acceptors (e.g., BTP&#8208;Ec9 and L8&#8208;BO), but also possesses a decent power conversion efficiency of 19.12% in ternary devices when blended with BTP&#8208;Ec9:L8&#8208;BO mixture.








Abstract
Benefiting from the emergence of narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs), especially &#8220;Y&#8221; series, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is rapidly improved. However, polymer donors with high efficiency, easy synthesis, and good universality are relatively scarce except PBDB&#8208;TF and D18. Herein, two polymer donors are designed and synthesized based on 4&#8208;chlorothiazole derivatives with simple structures, namely PTz3Cl and PBTTz3Cl. The OSCs based on PBTTz3Cl with slightly weaker intermolecular forces in comparison to PTz3Cl exhibits a decent PCE of 18.38% in blending with SMA L8&#8208;BO, owing to its strong donor/acceptor interaction with L8&#8208;BO, which shapes suitable phase separation morphology. Further research finds that PBTTz3Cl can exhibit excellent photovoltaic performances with various SMA materials, highlighting its universality. Based on this, ternary PSCs are designed where BTP&#8208;eC9 is introduced as a guest into the PBTTz3Cl:L8&#8208;BO host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 19.12%, which is among the highest values for PSCs. This work provides a new design of low&#8208;cost electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing highly versatile, high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Photonic Crystal&#8208;Integrated Optoelectronic Devices with Naked&#8208;Eye Visualization and Digital Readout for High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Ultratrace Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic crystal&#8208;based optoelectronic device is developed for rapid and real&#8208;time digital monitoring of ultratrace analytes with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, which is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases, such as the quick identification of diabetes from ultratrace glucose in sweat.








Abstract
The detection of ultratrace analytes is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases. However, a major challenge is fast, naked&#8208;eye, high&#8208;resolution ultratrace detection. Herein, a rectangular 3D composite photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based optoelectronic device is first designed that combines the sensitivity&#8208;enhancing effects of PCs and optoelectronic devices with fast and real&#8208;time digital monitoring. A crack&#8208;free, centimeter&#8208;scale, mechanically robust ellipsoidal composite PCs with sufficient hardness and modulus, even exceeding most plastics and aluminum alloys, are developed. The high mechanical strength of ellipsoidal composite PCs allows them to be hand&#8208;machined into rectangular geometries that can be conformally covered with the centimeter&#8208;scale flat light&#8208;detection area without interference from ambient light, easily integrating 3D composite PC&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. The PC&#8208;based device's signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio increases dramatically from original 30&#8211;40 to &#8776;60&#8211;70&#160;dB. Droplets of ultratrace analytes on the device are identified by fast digital readout within seconds, with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, enabling rapid identification of ultratrace glucose in artificial sweat and diabetes risk. The developed 3D PC&#8208;based sensor offers the advantages of small size, low cost, and high reliability, paving the way for wider implementation in other portable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Matching Bidentate Ligand Anchoring: an Accurate Control Strategy for Stable Single&#8208;Atom/ZIF Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;loading MN4 SACs (&gt;10 wt.%) with tunable coordination environments are designed using the matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy. The obtained Cu SA/ZIF nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800. Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms.








Abstract
Improving metal loading and controlling the coordination environment is nontrivial and challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which have the greatest atomic efficiency and largest number of interface sites. In this study, a matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy is designed for the construction of CuN4 SACs with tunable coordination environments (Cu loading range from 0.4 to15.4 wt.%). The obtained Cu SA/ZIF and Cu SA/ZIF*&#65279;&#65279; (0.4 wt.%) (ZIF and ZIF*&#160;= Zeolitic imidazolate framework with Matching bidentate N&#8208;ligands) nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800 (NC = N&#8208;doped porous carbon). Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL anchoring strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms. This strategy provides a basis for the construction of M SA/MOF, which has the potential to narrow the gap between experimental and theoretical catalysis, as further confirmed by the successful preparation of Fe SA/ZIF and Ni SA/ZIF.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile platform that enables self&#8208;powered programming of fibroblasts into neurons via a scalable magnetoelastic generator array is developed. The generated electrical stimulation enhances&#160;the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device can harness the biomechanical activities in human bodies and convert them into electrical signals, thereby potentially providing a general therapeutic approach for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Developing scalable electrical stimulating platforms for cell and tissue engineering applications is limited by external power source dependency, wetting resistance, microscale size requirements, and suitable flexibility. Here, a versatile and scalable platform is developed to enable tunable electrical stimulation for biological applications by harnessing the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems, converting gentle air pressure (100&#8211;400&#160;kPa) to yield a current of up to 10.5&#160;mA and a voltage of 9.5&#160;mV. The platform can be easily manufactured and scaled up for integration in multiwell magnetoelastic plates via 3D printing. The authors demonstrate that the electrical stimulation generated by this platform enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device has broad applications in high throughput organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, and paves the way for future development of neural engineering, including cellular therapy via implantable self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation devices.

         <title>Engineering Co&#63743;P Alloy Foil to a Well&#8208;Designed Integrated Electrode Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying strategy is developed to address existing drawbacks of binder&#8208;free nanostructured integrated electrodes toward electrochemical energy storage. Accordingly, a Co&#63743;P alloy&#8208;derived Co(OH)x/Co2P mesoporous electrode not only loads over 3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3 of active materials, but also exhibits excellent electron&#8208;ion mixed conductivity and high mechanical stability, making it a promising candidate for practical applications.








Abstract
Nanostructured integrated electrodes with binder&#8208;free design show great potential to solve the ever&#8208;growing problems faced by currently commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries such as insufficient power and energy densities. However, there are still many challenging problems limiting practical application of this emerging technology, in particular complex manufacturing process, high fabrication cost, and low loading mass of active material. Different from existing fabrication strategies, here using a Co&#63743;P alloy foil as a precursor&#160; a simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying method to well address the above issues is demonstrated. The resultant freestanding mesoporous np&#8208;Co(OH)x/Co2P product possesses not only active compositions of high specific capacity and large electrode packing density (&gt;3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3) to meet practical capacity requirements, high&#8208;conductivity and well&#8208;developed nanoporous framework to achieve simultaneously fast ion and electron transfer, but also interconnected ligaments and suitable free space to ensure strong structural stability. Its comprehensively excellent electrochemical energy storage (EES) performances in both lithium/sodium&#8208;ion batteries and lithium&#8208;ion capacitors can further illustrate the effectiveness of the integrated electrode preparation strategy, such as remarkable reversible specific capacities/capacitances, dominated pseudo&#8208;capacitive EES mechanism, and ultra&#8208;long cycling life. This study provides new insights into preparation and design of high&#8208;performance integrated electrodes for practical applications.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling Suppression by Enhanced Lattice Rigidity in 2D Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D perovskite single crystal is designed by introducing a diamine molecule DGA into the lead&#8208;iodine octahedron. Compared with the monoamine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEA, the DGA strongly interacts with the [PbI6]4&#8208;, improving the lattice stiffness, reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and lattice distortion, and making the corresponding device to achieve high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and high X&#8208;ray sensitivity (4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite single crystals (PSCs) usually demonstrate better X&#8208;ray detection performance than Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) PSCs. However, the mechanism of the improved performance is still elusive. Here, by the aid of strong interactions between dimethylbiguanide (DGA) and PbI2, a novel DJ&#8208;perovskitoid (DGA)PbI4 is designed. From the comparison of (DGA)PbI4 to other 2D PSCs, it is discovered that the tiniest lattice distortion and increased hydrogen bonds in the atom&#8208;scaled analysis strengthen lattice rigidity and weaken electron&#8208;phonon coupling to suppress disordered scattering of carriers, resulting in significantly improved carrier transport and stability. Therefore, high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a pronounced sensitivity of 4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 are achieved using (DGA)PbI4, which are the best in 2D Pb&#8208;based PSC devices to date. Finally, the (DGA)PbI4 devices exhibit good spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging and excellent long&#8208;term stability to work as a promising candidate for medical diagnostics and nondestructive determination.

         <title>In Situ Interweaved High Sulfur Loading Li&#8211;S Cathode by Catalytically Active Metalloporphyrin Based Organic Polymer Binders</title>

An in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is proposed and excellent performance is achieved in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The elaborate design of powerful Li&#8211;S binders with extended&#8208;functions like polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li+ hopping/transferring in addition to robust adhesion&#8208;property has remained a challenge. Here, an in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin based covalent&#8208;bonding organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is reported for the first time. Thus&#8208;produced functional binders possess excellent mechanical&#8208;strengths, polysulfides adsorption/catalysis, and Li+ hopping/transferring ability. Specifically, the modulus of Mn&#8208;COP can reach up to &#8776;54.60&#160;GPa (&#8776;40 times higher than poly(vinylidene fluoride)) and the relative cell delivers a high initial&#8208;capacity (1027 mAh g&#8208;1, 1 C and 913 mAh g&#8208;1, 2 C), and excellent cycling&#8208;stability for &gt;1000 cycles even at 4 C. The utilization&#8208;rate of sulfur can reach up to 81.8% and the electrodes based on these powerful binders can be easily scale&#8208;up fabricated (&#8776;20&#160;cm in a batch&#8208;experiment). Noteworthy, Mn&#8208;COP based cell delivers excellent capacities at a high sulfur&#8208;loading (8.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and low E/S ratio (5.8&#160;&#181;L mg&#8208;1). In addition, theoretical calculations reveal the vital roles of metalloporphyrin and thiourea&#8208;groups in enhancing the battery&#8208;performance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Free Units Boost Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to regulate the charge redistribution of active centers of metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts by using heteroatom&#8208;free methyl groups (MGs) is reported. MGs can produce ortho activation, confirming the ortho carbon (site&#8208;5) as active centers. This study provides insight into the design of highly efficient metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts via the regulation of valence bonds.








Abstract
Accurate identification of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst (CMFE) activity and enhancing their catalytic efficiency for O2 conversion is an urgent and challenging task. This study reports a promising strategy to simultaneously develop a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;defined heterocyclic&#8208;free biphenyl or fluorenyl units. Unlike heteroatom doping, the developed method not only supplies methyl&#8208;induced molecular configuration to promote activity, but also provides a direct opportunity to identify heteroatom&#8208;free carbon active centers. The introduction of methyl groups (MGs) with reversible valence bonds into a pristine biphenyl&#8208;based COF results in an excellent performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.74&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is among the highest values for CMFE&#8208;COFs as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Combined with in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, the MG&#8208;bound skeleton (DAF&#8208;COF) is found to produce ortho activation, confirming the ortho carbon (site&#8208;5) adjacent to MGs as active centers. This may be attributed to the opening and binding of MGs, which effectively regulate the molecular configuration and charge redistribution, as well as improve charge transfer and reduce the energy barrier. This study provides insight into the design of highly efficient metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts via the regulation of valence bonds.

This may be attributed to the opening and binding of MGs, which effectively regulate the molecular configuration and charge redistribution, as well as improve charge transfer and reduce the energy barrier. This study provides insight into the design of highly efficient metal-free organic electrocatalysts via the regulation of valence bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hydrogel Actuators
In article number 2209870, Stefano Di Stefano, Andreas Walther, and co&#8208;workers show how pH feedback systems with programmable lifetimes and pH&#8208;responsive actuators can be combined to make autonomous soft robotic devices that perform tasks in a pre&#8208;organized fashion. Such autonomous robots enable, for instance &#8220;fire&#8208;and&#8208;forget&#8221; operation for interlocking of complex interfaces or for gripping objects through small openings.

Liquid Metal Liesegang Rings
In article number 2209392, Qian Wang, Jing Liu, and co&#8208;workers investigate the Liesegang rings phenomenon induced by gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) on gold film systems. The mechanisms are attributed to the reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limiting processes of the LM on gold film, over which chemical reactions occur simultaneously with the spatially recurrent crystallization of intermetallic compounds AuGa2 and AuIn2. This discovery has generalized purpose and can serve as a flashpoint for tackling diverse self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems between LMs and various solid metal films.

Self&#8208;Dancing Rings
By exploring self&#8208;sustained snapping instabilities, in article number 2207372, Yao Zhao, Jie Yin, and co&#8208;workers report a self&#8208;dancing and crawling wavy ring under heat and light. This ring crawls like a front&#8208;wheel or rear&#8208;wheel car and can even self&#8208;navigate through a narrow space that is smaller than its ring size via snapping and adaptive interactions.

Photonic Colloidal Glass
Continuous gradients in self&#8208;assembled materials can provide functionality exceeding that of the homogenous case. In article number 2208745, Markus Retsch and co&#8208;workers present a synthesis method that provides gradient size distributions via a controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP). The high degree of control allows the fabrication of a continuous&#8208;gradient photonic glass with enhanced broadband reflectance.

         <title>2D Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis and functionalization of 2D germananes (hydrogen atom and covalent group(s) termination) via topotactical deintercalation offer customizable properties or new functionalities. The fundamentals from synthesis and exfoliation to properties; for optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical applications are reviewed. The review presents the recent progress and challenges, and provides insight for future exploration of these materials.








Abstract
In the realm of 2D layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8211;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. The preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes, are comprehensively covered. The progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas are reviewed. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

         <title>Computational Biomaterials: Computational Simulations for Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the achievements on computational biomaterials in biomedical applications, summarizes the computational simulation in revealing internal physicochemical mechanism behind the biomaterial, and offers an outlook on the computatinal biomaterials in nanoenabled amalgamation of chemistry, material science, biology, computational and medicine based on the reports of computational biomaterials&#8208;involved disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapies and other biomimetic biomaterials.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuned Ultra&#8208;Microporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membrane: Pore&#8208;Tailoring Optimization for C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89) with triangular channels is successfully blueprinted and constructed via mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. By selecting different&#8208;sized ligands and applying linker modification, the channel is fine&#8208;tuned and precisely tailored into the optimized zone, realizing high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. Moreover, the excellent performances of JLU&#8208;MOF mixed&#8208;matrix membranes have validated the application potential for C2H2/C2H4 separation.








Abstract
Effective separation of ethyne from ethyne/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) mixtures is a challenging and crucial industrial process. Herein, an ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) platform, Cd(dicarboxylate)2(ditriazole), with triangular channels is proposed for high&#8208;efficiency separation of C2H2 from C2H4. The targeted structures are constructed via a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy by selecting different&#8208;sized ligands, allowing for tunable pore sizes and volumes. The pore properties can be further optimized by additional modification via pore environment tailoring. This concept leads to the successful synthesis of three ultra&#8208;microporous Cd&#8208;MOFs (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89). As intended, C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity gradually increase with progressively optimizing the pore structure by adjusting ligand length and substituents. JLU&#8208;MOF89, functionalized with methyl groups, features the most optimal pore chemistry and shows selective recognition of C2H2 over C2H4, owing to the framework&#8211;C2H2 host&#8211;guest interactions. Furthermore, JLU&#8208;MOFs are fabricated into mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for C2H2/C2H4 separation. C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 permselectivity are substantially enhanced by &#8805;400% and &#8805;200%, respectively, after hybridization of JLU&#8208;MOF88 and JLU&#8208;MOF89 with a polyimide&#160;polymer&#160;(6FDA&#8211;ODA). These membranes can work efficiently and are stable under different conditions, demonstrating their potential in actual ethyne separation.

         <title>Achieving Fast Charge Separation by Ferroelectric Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering for Rapid Sonotherapy of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to treat osteomyelitis under ultrasound&#160;is&#160;reported. The ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of&#160;a piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 enhances the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges, enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;infected osteomyelitis is life&#8208;threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here, a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/MXene (Ti3C2) triggered by ultrasound (US) is reported. Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of the&#160;piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of&#160;the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. The theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering is proposed, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.

With synergistic action of the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhances the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges, enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria-infected osteomyelitis is life-threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here, a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MXene (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) triggered by ultrasound (US) is reported. Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of the&#160;piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of&#160;the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. The theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering is proposed, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrathin Nonporous Polymer Separator Regulates Na Transfer Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Storage Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin exterior&#8208;nonporous polymer separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for high&#8208;energy sodium storage batteries. It effectively suppresses Na dendrites and avoids the related safety risk, as&#160;well&#160;as shows the ability to customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, thereby leading to ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase and cathode electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Sodium storage batteries are one of the ever&#8208;increasing next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to the abundant resources and low cost. However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite&#8208;related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 &#181;m) exterior&#8208;nonporous separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits&#160;from honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the&#160;separator, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety,&#160;enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as&#8208;prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium&#8208;based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.

         <title>Sequential Deposition of Multicomponent Bulk Heterojunctions Increases Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;bulk heterojunction active layer structure for organic solar cell (OSC) is constructed by sequential deposition of a PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend on top of a D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, in which the optimal morphology of the two binary blends were&#160;retained with a vertical phase separation, resulting in a record PCE of 19.61%.








Abstract
Constructing tandem and multi&#8208;blend organic solar cells (OSCs) is&#160;an effective way to overcome the absorption limitations of conventional single&#8208;junction devices. However, these methods inevitably require tedious multilayer deposition or complicated morphology&#8208;optimization procedures. Herein, sequential deposition is utilized as an effective and simple method to fabricate multicomponent OSCs with a double&#8208;bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of the active layer to further improve photovoltaic performance. Two efficient donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:L8&#8208;BO, are sequentially deposited to form the D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9/PM6:L8&#8208;BO double&#8208;BHJ active layer. In these double&#8208;BHJ OSCs, light absorption is significantly improved, and optimal morphology is also retained without requiring a more complicated morphology optimization involved in quaternary blends. Compared to the quaternary blend devices, energy loss (Eloss) is also reduced by rationally matching each donor with an appropriate acceptor. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved from 18.25% for D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 18.69% for PM6:L8&#8208;BO based binary blend OSCs to 19.61% for the double&#8208;BHJ OSCs. In contrast, a D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 quaternary blend of OSCs exhibited a dramatically reduced PCE of 15.83%. These results demonstrate that a double&#8208;BHJ strategy, with a relatively simple processing procedure, can potentially enhance the device performance of OSCs and lead to more widespread use.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <title>Orally Administrable H2S&#8208;Scavenging Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by Co&#8208;Flow Microfluidics for Comprehensive Restoration of Intestinal Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform is synthesized to scavenge and detect H2S to recover intestinal barrier damaged by inflammatory bowel diseases. Nanoplatform is prepared by encapsulation of UiO&#8208;66 with a CR probe (UR) in pH&#8208;responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) done via microfluidic. Following oral administration, HPMCAS dissolves to expose UR NPs at the inflamed intestine which adsorbs and detects H2S.








Abstract
Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption, and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H2S in the intestinal milieu produced by the&#160;sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to&#160;development of&#160;IBDs via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66) with a Cux&#8208;rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), is produced via&#160;a&#160;co&#8208;flow microfluidic approach with the ability to reduce H2S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO&#8208;66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration, and TJ proteins upregulation via H2S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR is verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H2S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.

         <title>Combined Vacuum Evaporation and Solution Process for High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells with Exceptional Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide are combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with high reproducibility. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.0% (certified PCE 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) under AM 1.5G illumination, which is currently the highest PCE for large area perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit outstanding performances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the complex solution chemistry of perovskites precursors renders it difficult to prepare large&#8208;area devices in a reproducible way, which is a prerequisite for the technology to make an impact beyond lab scale. Vacuum processing, instead, is an established technology for large&#8208;scale coating of thin films. However, with respect to the hybrid perovskites it is highly challenging due to the high vapor pressure of the organic ammonium halide. In this work, vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide is combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with large grains in a highly reproducible way. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.3% (certified 23.9%) on small area (0.10&#160;cm2), 24.0% (certified 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) and 20.0% for minimodule (16&#160;cm2), and maintain 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h 1&#8208;sun operation. The vacuum evaporation prevents advert environmental effects on lead halide formation and guarantees a reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films, which opens a promising way for large&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have unique superiorities in energy storage/conversion, in which the intrinsic roles of carbon at the heterogeneous interface are highlighted. The methods to construct a robust heterointerface in CHHs are summarized. The techniques to pinpoint the interface interaction and rehybridization electron configuration between carbon and hydroxides, and the future directions and perspective of the CHHs are outlined.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are first analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled. The methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8211;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective sites construction and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined.

         <title>Resolution of MoS2 Nanosheets&#8208;Induced Pulmonary Inflammation Driven by Nanoscale Intracellular Transformation and Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle Shuttles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets trigger lung inflammation that is fast recovered, although the products derived from their degradation remain in the alveolar macrophages and in the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 30 days. The&#160;in&#160;vivo&#160;biotransformation&#160;of&#160;MoS2 is caused by reactive oxygen species following three mechanisms: scrolling, etching, and oxidation, generating molybdate ions and oxide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Pulmonary exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause chronic lesions as a result of unresolved inflammation. Among 2D nanomaterials and graphene, MoS2 has received tremendous attention in optoelectronics and nanomedicine. Here an integrated approach is proposed to follow up the transformation of MoS2 nanosheets at the nanoscale and assesss&#160;their impact on lung inflammation status over 1 month after a single inhalation in mice. Analysis of immune cells, alveolar macrophages, extracellular vesicles, and cytokine profiling in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) shows that MoS2 nanosheets induced initiation of lung inflammation. However, the inflammation is rapidly resolved despite the persistence of various biotransformed molybdenum&#8208;based nanostructures in the alveolar macrophages and the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 1 month. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy experiments, the dynamics of MoS2 nanosheets transformation triggered by reactive oxygen species could be evidenced. Three main transformation mechanisms are observed directly at the nanoscale level: 1) scrolling of the dispersed sheets leading to the formation of nanoscrolls and folded patches, 2) etching releasing soluble MoO4&#8722;, and 3) oxidation generating oxidized sheet fragments. Extracellular vesicles released in BALF are also identified as a potential shuttle of MoS2 nanostructures and their degradation products and more importantly as mediators of inflammation resolution.

         <title>Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Ampere&#8208;Hour Capacities and Wide&#8208;Temperature Adaptabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid (IL) additive hydrogel is reported for flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs). Similar to a crab, the IL creates pores and captures water in the hydrogel, which improves the ionic conductivity and water retention of the hydrogel. The FZABs based on this hydrogel can operate at high and low temperatures.








Abstract
Flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) have significant potentials as efficient energy storage devices for wearable electronics because of their safeties and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratios. However, their application is limited by their short cycle lives, low discharge capacities per cycle, and high charge/discharge polarizations. Accordingly, herein, a poly(sodium acrylate)&#8211;polyvinyl alcohol (PANa&#8211;PVA)&#8211;ionic liquid (IL) hydrogel (PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL) is prepared using a hygroscopic IL, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, as an additive for twin&#8208;chain PANa&#8211;PVA. PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL exhibits a high conductivity of 306.9&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a water uptake of 2515 wt% at room temperature. Moreover, a low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalyst, namely, Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on N&#8208; and S&#8208;co&#8208;doped activated carbon black pearls 2000 (Co9S8&#8208;NSABP), is synthesized, which demonstrates a low O2 reversibility potential gap of 0.629&#160;V. FZABs based on PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co9S8&#8208;NSABP demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1.67&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 per cycle and long cycle lives of 330&#160;h.&#160;Large&#8208;scale flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air pouch cells exhibit total capacities of 1.03&#160;Ah and energy densities of 246&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This study provides new information about hydrogels with high ionic conductivities and water uptakes and should facilitate the application of FZABs in wearable electronics.

         <title>Topological Metal MoP Nanowire for Interconnect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires are demonstrated as a new class of interconnect material for on&#8208;chip applications. Owing to its high carrier density, low resistivity, and short electron mean free path, MoP nanowires exhibit dimensional scaling of resistivity far superior to effective copper (Cu) and ruthenium&#160;(Ru). MoP is also oxidation resistant and has a high cohesive energy, potentially enabling a barrier&#8208;free interconnect design. Thus, this work demonstrates MoP as a breakthrough material for interconnect technologies for continued downscaling of integrated circuits and future energy&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
The increasing resistance of copper (Cu) interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7&#160;nm technology node&#160;as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries at the nanoscale. Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising candidates to potentially replace current Cu interconnects. Here,&#160;we report the unprecedented resistivity scaling of topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires, and it is shown that the resistivity values are superior to those of nanoscale Cu interconnects &lt;500&#160;nm2 cross&#8208;section areas. The cohesive energy of MoP suggests better stability against electromigration, enabling a barrier&#8208;free design . MoP nanowires are more resistant to surface oxidation than the 20&#160;nm thick Cu. The thermal conductivity of MoP is comparable to those of Ru and Co. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the dimensional scaling of MoP, in terms of line resistance versus total cross&#8208;sectional area, is competitive to those of effective Cu with barrier/liner and barrier&#8208;less Ru, suggesting MoP is an attractive alternative for the scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

         <title>Heterogeneous Structure Omnidirectional Strain Sensor Arrays With Cognitively&#160;Learned Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An omnidirectional strain sensor array for electronic skin applications, which can detect and predict both the 360&#176; direction and strain intensity based on machine learning,&#160;is demonstrated. By adopting a learning algorithm based on the multiclass&#8211;multioutput model, highly accurate prediction of strain information is achieved.








Abstract
Mechanically stretchable strain sensors gain tremendous attention for bioinspired skin sensation systems and artificially intelligent tactile sensors. However, high&#8208;accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly (three sensors tilted by 45&#176;) coupled with machine learning (ML) &#8208;based neural network classification algorithm, is proposed. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain&#8208;insensitive electrode regions and strain&#8208;sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibits decent sensitivity with gauge factor (GF) of &#8776;8, a moderate sensing range (&#8776;0&#8211;35%), and relatively good reliability (3000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass&#8211;multioutput behavior&#8208;learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly exhibits highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three&#8208;unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with its&#160;neural network algorithm exhibits overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98% &#177; 2% over a strain range of &#8776;0&#8211;30% in various surface stimuli environments.

         <title>Direct Observation of Oxygen Atoms Taking Tetrahedral Interstitial Sites in Medium&#8208;Entropy Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interstitial solutes normally occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, this work provides the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms, and shows a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations in a medium&#8208;entropy alloy.








Abstract
Interstitial solutes, such as carbon in steels, are effective solid&#8208;solution hardening agents. These alloying elements are believed to occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, here&#160;the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms in a highly concentrated bcc solid solution&#8212;the (TiNbZr)86O12C1N1 medium&#8208;entropy alloy (MEA)&#8212;is&#160;provided, whereby&#160;the interstitial sites in which&#160;the&#160;oxygen&#160;atoms are located&#160;are discerned. In addition to oxygen interstitials residing in octahedral sites, the first unambiguous evidence of a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations&#160;is&#160;shown. This shift away from octahedral occupancy is explained as resulting from the extra cost of strain energy when the requisite displacement of the host atoms is deterred in the presence of nearby octahedral interstitials.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Piezoelectric ZnO Twin&#8208;Mesocrystal to Improve Peroxymonosulfate Utilization Efficiency via Piezo&#8208;Activation for Antibiotic Ornidazole Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO mesocrystals with different oxygen vacancy (OVs) concentrations are quantitatively regulated as models for understanding the role of OVs in piezoelectric&#8208;catalysis for peroxymonosulfate&#160;(PMS) activation. The ZnO with a moderate OVs concentration realizes increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation.








Abstract
Piezoelectric mesocrystals as defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in redox reactions. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the piezocatalytic performance in piezoelectric mesocrystals. Herein, twin&#8208;hierarchical structure ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystals are taken with different oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) concentrations to quantitatively investigate the effect of defect content on the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) piezo&#8208;activation in water purification. The ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration exhibits a rapid antibiotic ornidazole (ORZ) pollutants degradation rate (0.034&#160;min&#8722;1) and achieves a high PMS utilization efficiency (0.162) that exceeds the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic processes, while excessive OVs suppressed the piezocatalytic performance. Through calculations of electron property and reactants affinity, a quantitative relationship between OVs concentration and piezocatalytic properties is established. The ZnO mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration realized increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of defect engineering in mesocrystal to realize enhanced piezocatalytic performance.

         <title>Morphology Tuning via Linker Modulation: Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Nanostructures with Exceptional Chemical Stability for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;rationally designed synthetic route for synthesizing pure imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic polymers&#160;(POPs) by modulating the liker geometry to induce rigidity into the system&#160;is&#160;presented. Directing the reaction solely toward imidazole linkage formation instead of the imine&#8208;imidazole mixture tunes the random morphology to hollow&#8208;spheres, improving porosity&#160;and thermal and chemical stability. These POPs show excellent performance as metal&#8208;free bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts toward water splitting with long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
The development of synthetic routes for the formation of robust porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined nanoscale morphology is fundamentally significant for their practical applications. The thermodynamic characteristics that arise from reversible covalent bonding impart intrinsic chemical instability in the polymers, thereby impeding their overall potential. Herein, a unique strategy is reported to overcome the stability issue by designing robust imidazole&#8208;linked POPs via tandem reversible/irreversible bond formation. Incorporating inherent rigidity into the secondary building units leads to robust microporous polymeric nanostructures with hollow&#8208;spherical morphologies. An in&#8208;depth analysis by extensive solid&#8208;state NMR (1D and 2D) study on 1H, 13C, and 14N nuclei elucidates the bonding and reveals the high purity of the newly designed imidazole&#8208;based POPs. The nitrogen&#8208;rich polymeric nanostructures are further used as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, the rigid POPs show excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long&#8208;term durability. Among them, the most efficient OER electrocatalyst (TAT&#8208;TFBE) requires 314&#160;mV of overpotential to drive 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density, demonstrating its superiority over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2).

An in-depth analysis by extensive solid-state NMR (1D and 2D) study on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei elucidates the bonding and reveals the high purity of the newly designed imidazole-based POPs. The nitrogen-rich polymeric nanostructures are further used as metal-free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, the rigid POPs show excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long-term durability. Among them, the most efficient OER electrocatalyst (TAT-TFBE) requires 314&#160;mV of overpotential to drive 10 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art catalysts (RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions of Highly Soluble Naphthalene Diimide Derivatives for Neutral pH Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

The design of organic redox&#8208;active molecules to develop spin pairing during the electron&#8208;transfer process improves cycling performance in aqueous redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Organic redox&#8208;active molecules are a promising platform for designing sustainable, cheap, and safe charge carriers for redox flow batteries. However, radical formation during the electron&#8208;transfer process causes severe side reactions and reduces cyclability. This problem is mitigated by using naphthalene diimide (NDI) molecules and regulating their &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking of NDI molecules, which leads to precipitation, is disrupted by tethering four ammonium functionalities, and the solubility approaches 1.5&#160;m in water. The gentle &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induce clustering and disassembling of the NDI molecules during the two&#8208;electron transfer processes. When the radical anion forms, the antiferromagnetic coupling develops tetramer and dimer and nullifies the radical character. In addition, short&#8208;range&#8208;order NDI clusters at 1&#160;m concentration are not precipitated but inhibit crossover. They are disassembled in the subsequent electron&#8208;transfer process, and the negatively charged NDI core strongly interacts with ammonium groups. These behaviors afford excellent RFB performance, demonstrating 98% capacity retention for 500 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and 99.5% Coulombic efficiency with 2&#160;m electron storage capacity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Efficient Photocatalysis via Modulation of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Reactive Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation and reactive phase control strategies exhibit robust manipulation role in promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, lowering photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, and facilitating mass transfer, which have received much attention and become the research hotspot in photocatalytic field for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field. Herein, recent advances in photocatalysis modulated by electric field (i.e., piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric fields, as well as their coupling) with specific examples and mechanisms discussion are first examined. Subsequently, the strategy via magnetic field manipulation for enhancing photocatalytic performance is scrutinized, including the spin polarization, Lorentz force, and magnetoresistance effect. Afterward, materials with tailored structure and composition design enabled by reactive phase control and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities to further boost photocatalytic efficiency are presented, aiming at providing crucial theoretical and experimental guidance for those working in photocatalysis, ferroelectrics, triboelectrics, piezo&#8208;/pyro&#8208;/tribo&#8208;phototronics, and electromagnetics, among other related areas.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerated discovery of two molecules with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic laser performance from screening 40&#160;candidates is made possible by the introduction of an automated platform encompassing automated synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be run fully end&#8208;to&#8208;end. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and accelerated discovery of materials.








Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find two molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

         <title>Thermally Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep&#8208;level defects with high formation energy, while post&#8208;annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.








Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell films is presented. A top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Assisted Sulfonated Covalent Organic Nanosheets: Extrinsic Charge for Improved Ion Transport and Salinity&#8208;Gradient Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient ion transport through nanofluidic channels is critical to electrochemical energy conversion technology, however, limited by low intrinsic surface charges of channels. Herein, the tunable incorporations of extrinsic surface charge is demonstrated to improve ion transport properties, which are achieved by assembly of ionic surfactant and covalent organic nanosheets. The optimized ion channels exhibit a high&#8208;efficiency salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is the vital property of nanofluidic channels for salinity&#8208;gradient energy harvesting and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies. 2D nanofluidic channels constructed by nanosheets exhibit great superiority in ion selectivity, but a high ion transport rate remains challenging due to the insufficiency of intrinsic surface charge density in nanoconfinement. Herein, extrinsic surface charge into nanofluidic channels composed of surfactant&#8208;assisted sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs), which enable tunable ion transport behaviors, is demonstrated.

     alt="Surfactant-Assisted Sulfonated Covalent Organic Nanosheets: Extrinsic Charge for Improved Ion Transport and Salinity-Gradient Energy Harvesting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient ion transport through nanofluidic channels is critical to electrochemical energy conversion technology, however, limited by low intrinsic surface charges of channels. Herein, the tunable incorporations of extrinsic surface charge is demonstrated to improve ion transport properties, which are achieved by assembly of ionic surfactant and covalent organic nanosheets. The optimized ion channels exhibit a high-efficiency salinity-gradient energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge-governed ion transport is the vital property of nanofluidic channels for salinity-gradient energy harvesting and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies. 2D nanofluidic channels constructed by nanosheets exhibit great superiority in ion selectivity, but a high ion transport rate remains challenging due to the insufficiency of intrinsic surface charge density in nanoconfinement. Herein, extrinsic surface charge into nanofluidic channels composed of surfactant-assisted sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs), which enable tunable ion transport behaviors, is demonstrated. The polar moiety of surfactant is embedded in SCONs to adjust in-plane surface charges, and the aggregation of nonpolar moiety results in the sol-to-gel transformation of SCON solution for membrane fabrication. The combination endows SCON/surfactant membranes with considerable water-resistance, and the designable extrinsic charges promise fast ion transport and high ion selectivity. Additionally, the SCON/surfactant membrane, serving as a power generator, exhibits huge potential in harvesting salinity-gradient energy where corresponding output power density can reach up to 9.08&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a 50-fold salinity gradient (0.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaCl|0.01&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaCl). The approach to extrinsic surface charge provides new and promising insight into regulating ion transport behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colored Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells Exceeding 23.5% Efficiency Enabled by Luminescent Down&#8208;Shift Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) quantum dot (QD) films with different emission wavelengths are deposited on (silicon heterojunction) SHJ solar cells to alleviate the parasitic short&#8208;wavelength light absorption through the luminescence down&#8208;shift process. By utilizing inkjet printing technology, color&#8208;patterned SHJ solar cells are achieved, which can maintain a power conversion efficiency of 23.5% for more than 4 months.








Abstract
Colored solar panels, realized by depositing various reflection layers or structures, are emerging as power sources for building with visual aesthetics. However, these panels suffer from reduced photocurrent generation due to the less efficient light harvesting from visible light reflection and degraded power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, color&#8208;patterned silicon heterojunction solar cells are achieved by incorporating luminescent quantum dots (QDs) with high quantum yields as light converters to realize an asthenic appearance with high PCE. It is found that large bandgap (blue) QD layers can convert UV light into visible light, which can notably alleviate the parasitic absorption by the front indium tin oxide and doped amorphous silicon. Additionally, a universal optical path model is proposed to understand the light transmission process, which is suitable for luminescent down&#8208;shift devices. In this study, solar cells with a PCE exceeding 23.5% are achieved using the combination of a blue QD layer and a top low refractive index anti&#8208;reflection layer. Based on our&#160;best knoledge,the obtained PCE is the highest for a color&#8208;patterned solar cell. The results suggest an enhanced strategy involving incorporation of luminescent QDs with an optical path design for high&#8208;performance photovoltaic panels with visual aesthetics.

         <title>Lightweight 3D Graphene Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively thermal expanded 3D graphene metamaterial is created through a hyperbolically oriented freezing strategy under a dual temperature gradient along with orthogonal directions after &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly among 2D graphene sheets. It has demonstrated tunable negative thermal expansion. Both experimental investigation and numerical simulation have cooperatively revealed the evolution mechanism of thermal&#8208;induced deformation at multiscale.








Abstract
In this study, a 3D graphene metamaterial (GM) showing negative thermal expansion is prepared using a strategy of hyperbolically oriented freezing under a dual temperature gradient along orthogonal directions after the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly of 2D graphene sheets. As the fundamental construction element of the 3D GM, the graphene sheet displays anomalous shrinking deformation with a thermal expansion coefficient of (&#8722;6.12 &#177; 0.28) &#215; 10&#8722;6 that is triggered by thermally induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrations of the C&#63743;C bonds. A combination of numerical simulations and experimental investigations validates that anomalous negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior can be effectively delivered to scalable 3D GM candidates at larger dimensions beyond the basic 2D graphene sheets at the microscale. The multiscale design and optimization of the structural characterization of the 3D GM further realize the desirable regulation of the NTE performance with the NTE coefficient ranging from negative ((&#8722;7.5&#177; 0.65) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) to near&#8208;zero values ((&#8722;0.8 &#177; 0.25) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1). This is attributed to the NTE&#8208;derived release regulation of the primary stress/strain of the microstructure, and the 3D GM exhibits high thermal stability while preserving the desirable structural robustness and fatigue resistance under thermo&#8208;mechanical coupling conditions. Therefore, this 3D GM offers promising potential for applications as protective skin, thermal actuator, smart switcher, and packing filler.

         <title>Switchable Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Copolymer for Melt&#8208;Processing and Thermal Carbonization&#8212;3D Printing of Carbon Supercapacitor Electrodes with High Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile copolymer is 3D patterned using melt&#8208;extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing. During prestabilization the structure is made infusible allowing thermal stabilization and carbonization without remelting. 3D printed grid&#8208;type supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2 after activation.








Abstract
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non&#8208;wovens. Here, a PAN&#8208;copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer is presented to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN&#8208;copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D&#8208;melt&#8208;printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt&#8208;processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom&#8208;in&#8208;design of carbon materials to mold&#8208;free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, open meshed carbon electrodes are printed for supercapacitors that are metal&#8208; and binder&#8208;free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;Based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expansile kirigami acellular dermal matrix (ADM) offers natural shaping of implant&#8208;based breast reconstruction with securely holding the implant. Guided by finite element modeling, stretchability, curvature, and elasticity of kirigami ADM is precisely controlled. The developed kirigami ADM potentially offers patient&#8208;specific reconstruction while minimizing operative time and cost.








Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are 2D and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, a kirigami strategy is presented to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformably wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. This kirigami ADM can provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

This kirigami ADM can provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient-specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Charge Carrier Recombination in the Interconnecting Layer to Boost the Efficiency and Stability of Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) is conducted to narrow the hole/electron density offset in the interconnecting layer, which contributes to a balanced charge carrier recombination thus reducing the energy loss of the TSCs. A promising 23.17% power conversion efficiency, an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.15&#160;V, and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The charge carriers of single&#8208;junction solar cells can be fluently extracted and then collected by electrodes, leading to weak charge carrier accumulation and low energy loss (Eloss). However, in tandem solar cells (TSCs), it is a considerable challenge to obtain a balance between the densities of the holes and electrons extracted from the two respective subcells to facilitate an efficient recombination in the interconnecting layer (ICL). Herein, a charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs is proposed, centered on the simultaneous regulation of the defect states of CsPbI1.9Br1.1 perovskite in the front subcell and hole transport ability from the perovskite to ICL. The target hole density on the perovskite surface and the hole loss before reaching the ICL are significantly improved. As a result, the hole/electron density offset in the ICL can be effectively narrowed, leading to a balanced charge carrier recombination, which reduces the Eloss in TSCs. The resulting inorganic perovskite/organic 0.062&#8208;cm2 TSC exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17% with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.15&#160;V, and the PCE of the 1.004&#8208;cm2 device (21.69%) exhibited a weak size&#8208;dependence. This charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy can also effectively enhance the operational and ultraviolet&#8208;light stabilities of the TSCs.

         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k Capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region, acquiring high strength, and ductility like composites. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength of the density&#8208;variant nanolattice by &#8776;3.3&#8208;fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.








Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, 3D hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here,&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8211;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.&#160;We&#160;explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compressed before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Synthesis of L10&#8208;Iron Triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt Intermetallic Electrocatalysts via a Phosphide&#8208;Induced Structural Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel synthesis of L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt nanoparticles as ORR electrocatalysts by using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. The formation of the L10 structure depends on the abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the M(iron triad)&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution.








Abstract
Structurally ordered L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt with a M(iron triad)/Pt ratio &#8776;1:1 has drawn increasing attention in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis and fuel cell technologies by virtue of the high performance derived from their strong surface strain. However, the synthesis of intermetallic L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt generally requires the accurate content control of the multicomponent and the sufficient thermal energy to overcome the kinetic barrier for atom diffusion. This work reports a synthesis of sub &#8776;5&#160;nm L10&#8208;intermetallic nanoparticles using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. Taking the L10&#8208;CoPt intermetallic, for example, the formation of the L10 structure depends on the Co2P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. L10&#8208;CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with different loading and states to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., L10&#8208;NiPt and L10&#8208;FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide&#8208;induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.

         <title>MoS2&#8208;Mediated Epitaxial Plating of Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2 is employed as the substrate for realizing epitaxial plating of zinc. The edges of MoS2 are proved to have an inducing effect on zinc deposition and thus facilitating the vertical growth of zinc. When only exposing basal plane of the large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2, epitaxial zinc deposition with high (002) plane orientation is realized.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anodes (Li, Zn, etc.) are regarded as promising solutions for next&#8208;generation advanced batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, most of these metal anodes suffer from dendrite growth, which severely restricts their practical applications. Recently, epitaxial anode metal deposition by choosing a suitable substrate has received tremendous attention as an effective strategy to suppress dendrites. However, the epitaxial relationship between plated metal and the substrate has been a subject of debate. Herein, large&#8208;area, mono&#8208;orientated 2D material (MoS2) is used, for the first time, to electrodeposit truly epitaxial Zn anodes. The continuous (without edges) mono&#8208;orientated MoS2 films are shown to be an effective strategy for suppressing metal dendrites. In addition, the epitaxial nature of the electrodeposited Zn anode is proven by pole figure analysis, which provides the first demonstration of truly epitaxial Zn anode growth over large area as metal anode protection strategy through epitaxy.

In addition, the epitaxial nature of the electrodeposited Zn anode is proven by pole figure analysis, which provides the first demonstration of truly epitaxial Zn anode growth over large area as metal anode protection strategy through epitaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Twin S&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System with Self&#8208;Assembled Heterojunctions Yields Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar hydrogen generation using heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems is fast emerging. The poor charge separation and futile charge transports routes in Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions; however, constitute a huge bottleneck for hydrogen evolution. A Twin S&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic system is developed to overcome this bottleneck, which yields an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and high apparent quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Designing heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems has been a promising approach for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, in the traditional Z&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, the poor charge separation, and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers remain a huge bottleneck. To rationally design S&#8208;Scheme (i.e., Step scheme) heterojunctions by avoiding the futile charge transport routes is therefore seen as an attractive approach to achieving high hydrogen evolution rates. Herein, a twin S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed involving graphitic C3N4 nanosheets self&#8208;assembled with hydrogen&#8208;doped rutile TiO2 nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. This catalyst shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 62.37&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and high apparent quantum efficiency of 45.9% at 365&#160;nm. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer induced by the unique twin S&#8208;scheme structure. The charge transfer route in the twin S&#8208;scheme is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spin&#8208;trapping tests. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (TPV), and other ex situ characterizations further corroborate the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. This work offers a new perspective on constructing artificial photosynthetic systems with S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions to enhance photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Photolithography&#8208;Based Microfabrication of Biodegradable Flexible and Stretchable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient or biodegradable flexible and stretchable devices which degrade into benign components, especially in biofluids or aqueous solutions, can pave way for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly electronics for both industrial and medical applications. A photolithography&#8208;based approach allows highly miniaturized and scalable fabrication of flexible/stretchable biodegradable devices using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques.








Abstract
Biodegradable sensors based on integrating conductive layers with polymeric materials in flexible and stretchable forms have been established. However, the lack of a generalized microfabrication method results in large&#8208;sized, low spatial density, and low device yield compared to the silicon&#8208;based devices manufactured via batch&#8208;compatible microfabrication processes. Here, a batch fabrication&#8208;compatible photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication approach for biodegradable and highly miniaturized essential sensor components is presented on flexible and stretchable substrates. Up to 1600 devices are fabricated within a 1 cm2 footprint and then the functionality of various biodegradable passive electrical components, mechanical sensors, and chemical sensors is demonstrated on flexible and stretchable substrates. The results are highly repeatable and consistent, proving the proposed method's high device yield and high&#8208;density potential. This simple, innovative, and robust fabrication recipe allows complete freedom over the applicability of various biodegradable materials with different properties toward the unique application of interests. The process offers a route to utilize standard micro&#8208;fabrication procedures toward scalable fabrication of highly miniaturized flexible and stretchable transient sensors and electronics.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Single Layer 2D Polymer for Low Variability and Excellent Scalability Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) are prepared and further used as an active layer in the memristor. The devices exhibit low variability, high reliability in terms of yield, stability and durability, nanometer scalability, as well as distinguished bending endurance, which verified the unambiguous role of SL&#8208;2DP film in diverse applications from high density information storage to ultra&#8208;thin flexible electronics.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale growth of highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) and their subsequent integration into memristors is key to advancing the development of high&#8208;density data storage devices. However, leakage problems resulting from the porous structure of 2DPs continue to make such advances extremely challenging. Herein,&#160;we&#160;overcome this issue by incorporating long alkoxy chains into key molecular building blocks to obtain a highly crystalline 2DP, as visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy, and prevent metal permeation in the subsequent device fabrication process. SL&#8208;2DP memristors constructed via direct evaporation of the top electrodes exhibit low variability (&#963;Vset&#160;= 0.14) due to the single&#8208;monomer&#8208;thick feature together with the high regular structure and coordination ability which minimizes the stochastic spatial distribution of conductive filaments (CFs) in both vertical and lateral dimensions. The variability is further decreased to 0.04 by confining the formation and fracture of CFs to the interface through the utilization of bilayer junctions. Using peak force tunneling atomic force microscopy, the nanometer scalability (&lt; 50 nm2) and low power consumption of these molecular memristor devices are demonstrated.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance flexible photodetector is realized by gating an organic electrochemical transistor with a perovskite solar cell, outperforming previously reported flexible photodetectors, which can be attributed to the high transconductance of the transistor. The device can monitor photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even remotely. This novel device design demonstrates great potential in emerging wearable optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, a high&#8208;performance flexible PD is presented by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8776;106, a fast response time of 67&#160;&#181;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804;0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Perturbed Multiresonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off Nonsensitized OLEDs with Pure Green Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;perturbation approach is developed for boosting the reverse intersystem crossing rate of multiresonance type B&#8211;N molecule by utilizing the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect of a gold atom. The resultant emitter exhibits a short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, which enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance nonsensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diode with a high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off, and good color purity.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR)&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatics are desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow bandwidth. But the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, resulting in severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. To solve this issue, a sensitizer for the MR&#8208;TADF emitter has been required. Herein, a new MR&#8208;TADF emitter is developed through coordination of Au with B/N&#8208;embedded polycyclic ligand. Benefitting from the Au perturbation, the RISC rate is dramatically accelerated to 2.3 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, leading to delayed fluorescence lifetime as short as 4.3 &#181;s. Meanwhile, the PLQY of 95% and full width at half maximum of 39&#160;nm (0.18&#160;eV) are essentially unchanged after metal coordination. Therefore, a high PLQY, short delayed fluorescence lifetime, and high color purity are concurrently realized in a single TADF emitter. Accordingly, vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs exhibit high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Flexible Electronics for Brain&#8208;Wide Selective Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel injectable class of flexible electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on remote magnetic actuation is developed. Its functionality, stability, extensibility, and biocompatibility for large&#8208;scale electrophysiological monitoring the neural activities of distinct neuron populations in the rodent brains are successfully demonstrated in this study.








Abstract
Flexible microelectronics capable of straightforward implantation, remotely controlled navigation, and stable long&#8208;term recording hold great promise in diverse medical applications, particularly in deciphering complex functions of neural circuits in the brain. Existing flexible electronics, however, are often limited in bending and buckling during implantation, and unable to access a large brain region. Here, an injectable class of electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation is presented. After simple transcriptional injection, the rigid coatings are biodegraded quickly and the bundles of magnetic&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;coated microelectrodes become separated, ultra&#8208;flexible, and magnetic actuated for further minimally invasive&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;interpenetration in the brain. As proof of concept, this paradigm&#8208;shifting approach is demonstrated for selective and multiplexed neural activities recording across distant regions in the deep rodent brains. Coupling with optogenetic neural stimulation, the unique capabilities of this platform in electrophysiological readouts of projection dynamics in vivo are also demonstrated. The ability of these miniaturized, remotely controllable, and biocompatible ferromagnetic flexible electronics to afford minimally invasive manipulations in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadows applications in other organ systems, with great potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.

         <title>Complex Living Materials Made by Light&#8208;Based Printing of Genetically Programmed Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based printing can be exploited to shape bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels into complex living materials. By combining a wild&#8208;type bioluminescent bacterium with a deliberately engineered E. coli strain, a living device is printed and used as a self&#8208;powered chemical sensor that simultaneously generate and absorb light through the metabolic activity of the embedded microorganisms.








Abstract
Living materials with embedded microorganisms can genetically encode attractive sensing, self&#8208;repairing, and responsive functionalities for applications in medicine, robotics, and infrastructure. While the synthetic toolbox for genetically engineering bacteria continues to expand, technologies to shape bacteria&#8208;laden living materials into complex 3D geometries are still rather limited. Here, it is shown that bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light&#8208;based printing techniques. Bioluminescent and melanin&#8208;producing bacteria are used to create complex materials with autonomous chemical&#8208;sensing capabilities by harnessing the metabolic activity of wild&#8208;type and engineered microorganisms. The shaping freedom offered by printing technologies and the rich biochemical diversity available in bacteria provides ample design space for the creation and exploration of complex living materials with programmable functionalities for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Piezoelectric 1T Phase MoSe2 Nanoflowers and Crystallographically Textured Electrodes for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric 1T MoSe2/carbon cloth (CC) nanocomposite is fabricated on a crystallographically textured electrode through a facile solvothermal method. The generated piezoelectric field can serve as the zinc&#8208;ion piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to promote kinetics. By virtue of intrinsic piezoelectric effect and phase engineering strategy, this nanopiezocomposite possesses enhanced kinetics and desirable electrochemical performances at low temperatures.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe2&#160;nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes can serve as an additional piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn2+. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10&#160;&#197;), overall high hydrophilicity, and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe2&#160;also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe2/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn2+ diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures. Moreover, 1T MoSe2/CC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries are constructed to evaluate the potential of the proposed material in low&#8208;temperature flexible energy storage devices. This work expounds the positive effect of intrinsic piezoelectricity of TMDs on Zn2+ migration and further explores the availabilities of TMDs in low&#8208;temperature wearable energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH&#8208;Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glutathione&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) is created and screened for brain gene editing via systemic administration. SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass intact blood&#8211;brain barrier, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein).








Abstract
CRISPR genome editing can&#160;potentially treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain&#8208;targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a major challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;We&#160;created and screened&#160;a library of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) for brain targeted delivery of biologics via systemic administration. In vivo studies demonstrate that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics including CRISPR genome editors targeting different genes in both Ai14 reporter mice and wild&#8208;type mice. In particular, up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild&#8208;type mice are observed. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

&lt;p&gt;A library of glutathione-responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) is created and screened for brain gene editing via systemic administration. SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass intact blood&#8211;brain barrier, enabling brain-wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein).

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR genome editing can&#160;potentially treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain-targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a major challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;We&#160;created and screened&#160;a library of glutathione (GSH)-responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) for brain targeted delivery of biologics via systemic administration. In vivo studies demonstrate that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain-wide delivery of various biologics including CRISPR genome editors targeting different genes in both Ai14 reporter mice and wild-type mice. In particular, up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (&lt;i&gt;App&lt;/i&gt;) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (&lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild-type mice are observed. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of the Origin for Reconstructed Active Sites on Oxyhydroxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites and proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism during oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The regulation of atomic and electronic structures of active sites plays an important role in the rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, the precise identification of the active sites for surface reconstruction behavior during OER remains elusive for water&#8208;alkali electrolysis. Herein, irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites through operando UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis), in situ Raman, and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. Density functional theory analysis rationalizes this typical electronic structure evolution causing the transfer of intramolecular electrons to form ligand holes, promoting the reconstruction of active sites. Specifically, unambiguous identification of active sites for CoFeCuOOH is explored by in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical calculation, confirming mechanism switch to oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism (OVSM) pathway on lattice oxygen. This work enables to elucidate the vital role of dynamic active&#8208;site generation and the representative contribution of OVSM pathway for efficient OER performance.

         <title>Engineered Phage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer in Cocktail Therapy against Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer with phages is developed that not only selectively identifies bacterial species but also shows a powerful ability to kill pathogenic bacteria in sepsis diagnosis and treatment. This synergetic therapy strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy offers a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, a novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE&#8208;PS) TBTCP&#8208;PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment is proposed. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE&#8208;PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive&#160;oxygen&#160;species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.

         <title>Interfacial Instability&#8208;Induced (3I) Adhesives through &#8220;Mediator&#8221; Solvent Diffusion for Robust Underoil Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is proposed by innovatively introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop new&#8208;type 3I adhesives, realizing instant and robust adhesion on different substrates and in diverse&#160;oils/organic solvents. This principle can be generally applied to different kinds of &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents and adhesive polymers, shedding new light on the design of new&#8208;generation adhesives facing complex environments.








Abstract
Underoil adhesives are intensively needed in case of oil spill caused by pipeline rupture, but remain a challenge owing to the obstruction of oil layer or their swelling in oil. Herein, a general solvent diffusion principle is demonstrated by introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop a new type of interfacial instability&#8208;induced (3I) adhesives, achieving effective underoil adhesion on various substrates and blocking the oil leakage within seconds. Microscopic characterization reveals a fast and dynamic solvent exchange process that destroys the oil layer by liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial diffusion between the &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvent and oil, enabling 3I adhesives to contact the solid surfaces directly. The principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy, and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next&#8208;generation adhesives in complex environments.

Simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;performance stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG and TE array infrared display. The stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG can be torn apart by hands with specific TE pairs, making it possible to fit different size of heat source surface. The TE infrared display realizes the encryption and decryption of information.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) devices exhibit considerable application potential in Internet of Things and personal health monitoring systems. However, TE self&#8208;powered devices are expensive and their fabrication process is complex. Therefore, large&#8208;scale preparation of the TE devices remains challenging. In this work, simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly and high&#8208;performance paper&#8208;based TE device, which can be used in both stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TE generators and infrared displays. When used as a paper&#8208;based TE generator, an output power of 940.8 &#181;W is achieved with a temperature difference of 40 K. The programmable infrared pattern based on the TE array display could be used to realize encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting properties. Moreover, a visual extraction algorithm is used to develop a mobile application for processing and decoding the infrared quick response code information. These findings offer an exciting approach to using paper&#8208;based TEGs in applications such as energy harvesting devices, optical encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and dynamic infrared display.

         <title>Mechanical Janus Structures by Soft&#8211;Hard Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile engineering strategy of designing soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures by leveraging distinct mechanical properties between soft and hard phase materials is provided. Harnessing the unique rotation behavior of mechanical Janus structures leads to the assembly of superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations, opening an avenue for the future exploration of functional structures and devices with seamless soft&#8211;hard material integration.








Abstract
Engineering Janus structures that possess anisotropic features in functions have attracted growing attention for a wide range of applications in sensors, catalysis, and biomedicine, and are yet usually designed at the nanoscale with distinct physical or chemical functionalities in their opposite sides. Inspired by the seamless integration of soft and hard materials in biological structures, here a mechanical Janus structure composed of soft and hard materials with a dramatic difference in mechanical properties at an additively manufacturable macroscale is presented. In the combination of extensive experimental, theoretical, and computational studies, the design principle of soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures is established and their unique rotation mechanism is addressed. The systematic studies of assembling the Janus structure units into superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations by programming the local rotations are further shown, providing a direct route of designing superstructures by leveraging mechanical Janus structures with unique soft&#8211;hard material integration. Applications are conducted to demonstrate the features and functionalities of assembled superstructures with local ordered organizations in regulating and filtering acoustic wave propagations, thereby providing exemplification applications of mechanical Janus design in functional structures and devices.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron spin qubits in silicon are shown to serve as magnetic field sensors at the atomic scale. The work presents a novel spectroscopy technique where a pair of exchange&#8208;coupled electron spins on phosphorus qubits in silicon is used to probe the local magnetic fields to determine the exact location of nuclear spins within the silicon chip.








Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Strategy for Achieving Blue Phosphorescent Carbon Dots with Outstanding Efficiency above 50%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a molecular engineering strategy, more functional groups are modified on the surface of carbon dots embedded in the rigid silica network, which not only greatly boosts the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, improves the intersystem crossing rate, but also stabilizes the triplet excited state, resulting in efficient blue phosphorescence.








Abstract
Highly efficient emission has been a long&#8208;lasting pursuit for carbon dots (CDs) owing to their enormous potential in optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, their room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) performance still largely lags behind their outstanding fluorescence emission, especially in the blue&#160;spectral region. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency blue RTP CDs have been designed and constructed via a simple molecular engineering strategy, enabling CDs with an unprecedented phosphorescence quantum efficiency of to 50.17% and a long lifetime of 2.03 s. This treating route facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density (n, &#960;*) configurations in the CD &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugate system through the introduction of abundant functional groups, which can evoke a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and further promote the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet excited states and radiative recombination from triplet excited states to ground state. With blue phosphorescent CDs as triplet donors, green, red, and white afterglow composites are successfully fabricated via effective phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Importantly, the color temperature of the white afterglow emission can be widely and facilely tuned from cool white to pure white and warm white. Moreover, advanced information encryption, light illumination, and afterglow/dynamic visual display have been demonstrated when using these multicolor&#8208;emitting CD&#8208;based afterglow systems.

         <title>A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&#8722;2 current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log10 scales using only 65 min treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin&#8208;resistant S.&#160;aureus (MRSA) biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from 1010 to 105.2 colony&#8208;forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1 day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 CFU g&#8722;1 at 7 days post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.

         <title>Stable Zn Anodes with Triple Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;gradient electrode that well integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The triple&#8208;gradient design synergistically optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux, and Zn deposition behavior, thus preventing dendrite growth and achieving long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for sustainable energy storage, but the undesired Zn dendrites growth severely shortens the cycle life.

&lt;p&gt;A triple-gradient electrode that well integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite-free Zn anode. The triple-gradient design synergistically optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion flux, and Zn deposition behavior, thus preventing dendrite growth and achieving long-term cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are highly desirable for sustainable energy storage, but the undesired Zn dendrites growth severely shortens the cycle life. Herein, a triple-gradient electrode that simultaneously integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite-free Zn anode. The simple mechanical rolling-induced triple-gradient design effectively optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion flux, and Zn deposition paths in the Zn anode, thus synergistically achieving a bottom-up deposition behavior for Zn metals and preventing the short circuit from top dendrite growth. As a result, the electrode with triple gradients delivers a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV and operates steadily over 400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;/2.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and 250&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;/1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, far surpassing the non-gradient, single-gradient and dual-gradient counterparts. The well-tunable materials and structures with the facile fabrication method of the triple-gradient strategy will bring inspiration for high-performance energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordinated Pd Site within Amorphous Palladium Selenide for Active, Selective, and Stable H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) with low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites have been successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites with disordered arrangement in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs canoptimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to&#160;significant enhancement on the catalytic performance toward H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability are essential for the practical applications of H2O2 electrosynthesis technology, but it is still formidably challenging. It is reported that the low&#8208;coordinated structure of Pd sites in amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) can significantly boost the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Detailed investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the disordered arrangement of Pd atoms in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs can promote the activity, while the Pd sites with low&#8208;coordinated environment can optimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to a significant enhancement in both the H2O2 selectivity and productivity. Impressively, a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C exhibits high H2O2 selectivity over 90% in different pH electrolytes. H2O2 productivities with &#8776;3245.7, 1725.5, and 2242.1&#160;mmol gPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#160;m KOH, 0.1&#160;m HClO4, and 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4 can be achieved, respectively, in an H&#8208;cell electrolyzer, being a pH&#8208;universal catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical synthesis. Furthermore, the produced H2O2 can reach 1081.8&#160;ppm in a three&#8208;phase flow cell reactor after 2&#160;h enrichment in 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4, showing the great potential of a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Fast, Multi&#8208;Bit, and Vis&#8208;Infrared Broadband Nonvolatile Optoelectronic Memory with MoS2/2D&#8208;Perovskite Van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique organic/inorganic alternating chain structure of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite enables the combination of the advantages of floating gate and charge trap memories to achieve fast, multi&#8208;bit, and vis&#8208;infrared broadband nonvolatile optoelectronic memory.








Abstract
Nonvolatile optoelectronic memory (NVOM) integrating the functions of optical sensing and long&#8208;term memory can efficiently process and store a large amount of visual scene information, which has become the core requirement of multiple intelligence scenarios. However, realizing NVOM with vis&#8208;infrared broadband response is still challenging. Herein, the room temperature vis&#8208;infrared broadband NVOM based on few&#8208;layer MoS2/2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) van der Waals heterojunction is realized. It is found that the 2D&#8208;RPP converts the initial n&#8208;type MoS2 into p&#8208;type and facilitates hole transfer between them. Furthermore, the 2D&#8208;RPP rich in interband states serves as an effective electron trapping layer as well as broadband photoresponsive layer. As a result, the dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/2D&#8208;RPP heterojunction enables the charge to transfer quickly under external field, which enables a large memory window (104&#160;V), fast write speed of 20 &#181;s, and optical programmable characteristics from visible light (405&#160;nm) to telecommunication wavelengths (i.e., 1550&#160;nm) at room temperature. Trapezoidal optical programming can produce up to 100 recognizable states (&gt;6 bits), with operating energy as low as 5.1 pJ per optical program. These results provide a route to realize fast, low power, multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic memory from visible to the infrared wavelength.

         <title>Rapid Melt&#8208;Quenching Enables General Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Bicontinuous Nanoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile approach is developed for synthesizing nanoporous metal compound supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings, representing a several&#8208;fold improvement of metal loading compared to benchmarks. Libraries of SACs can be synthesized by choosing various combinations of supporting matrixes and single atoms, thus achieving the synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their unique atomic structures and extraordinary activities in catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the lack of general and efficient approaches for producing high&#8208;density single atoms on suitably tailored supporting matrixes hinders their industrial applications. Here, a rapid melt&#8208;quenching strategy with high throughput to synthesize single atoms with high metal&#8208;atom loadings of up to 9.7 wt% or 2.6 at% on nanoporous metal compounds is reported, representing several&#8208;fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high&#8208;temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid&#8208;quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized using the strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single&#8208;atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.

         <title>Synthesis of MAPbBr3&#8208;Polymer Composite Films by Photolysis of DMF: Toward Transparent and Flexible Optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) with Hierarchical Multilevel Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent optical PUFs with hierarchical patterns are prepared by the top&#8208;down photolithography in combination with the bottom&#8208;up phase separation process on MAPbBr3&#8208;PMMA/PS composite films. The hierarchical patterns consist of random&#8208;sized spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within randomly oriented bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns). To achieve such multilevel complex patterns, a synthetic method of MAPbBr3 NPs based on the photolysis of DMF is newly developed.








Abstract
Physical entities with inherent randomness have been investigated as anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Herein, a transparent and flexible optical PUF label associated with multilevel complexity is demonstrated by taking advantage of the optical properties of hierarchical morphologies of the composite film composed of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles (MAPbBr3 NPs) and the intrinsic spinodal&#8208;decomposition&#8208;like phase separation of polymer blend (PMMA/PS blend). Due to the combinatorial effects of the photolysis synthesis of MAPbBr3 and the thermodynamic instability of the PMMA/PS blend, randomized patterns emerge at two&#8208;level scales. These patterns are intrinsically non&#8208;deterministic, and therefore, the PUF labels from the multilevel random patterns are challenging to replicate. This is mainly attributed to random spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within intricate bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns).

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Evolution with Molecular Catalyst Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active, durable, and selective catalysts for light&#8208;driven CO2 and water conversion to value&#8208;adding products are key toward a sustainable energy cycle. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one material is showcased, consisting of a metal&#8208;organic framework co&#8208;hosting two molecular catalysts. This assembly (nanozyme) harvests light, funnels energy to molecular sites, and enhances charge separation, thereby unlocking high photon efficiencies and adjustable syngas evolution.








Abstract
Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a high&#8208;priority intermediate for producing several commodity chemicals, e.g., ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Accordingly, parallel sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and protons to syngas is a key step toward a sustainable energy cycle. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems and materials often fall short as application&#8208;oriented concurrent CO and H2 evolution requires challenging reaction conditions which can hamper stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Here a light&#8208;harvesting metal&#8208;organic framework hosting two molecular catalysts is engineered to yield colloidal, water&#8208;stable, versatile nanoreactors for photocatalytic syngas generation with highly controllable product ratios. In&#8208;depth fluorescence, X&#8208;ray, and microscopic studies paired with kinetic analysis show that the host delivers energy efficiently to active sites, conceptually yielding nanozymes. This unlocked sustained CO2 reduction and H2 evolution with benchmark turnover numbers and record incident photon conversions up to 36%, showcasing a highly active and durable all&#8208;in&#8208;one material toward application in solar energy&#8208;driven syngas generation.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Device Autonomous Self&#8208;Healing Stretchable Soft Battery from Self&#8208;Bonded Eutectogels</title>

         <dc:description>
Most reported self&#8208;healable batteries possess limited stretchability and unable to achieve full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is presented to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) even at &#8211;20&#160;&#176;C. The present work provides a general soft electronic material platform for fabricating next&#8208;generation self&#8208;healing stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation energy storage devices should be soft, stretchable, and self&#8208;healable. Previously reported self&#8208;healable batteries mostly possess limited stretchability and rely on healable electrodes or electrolytes rather than achieving full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is reported to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) over a broad temperature range (&#8722;20~60&#160;&#176;C). Without requiring any external stimulus, the five&#8208;layered soft battery can efficiently recover both its mechanical and electrochemical performance at full&#8208;cell level. The developed AESB can be easily configured into various 3D architectures with highly interfacial compatible eutectogel electrodes, electrolyte, and substrate, presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of embodied energy technologies. The present work provides a general and user&#8208;friendly soft electronic material platform for fabricating a variety of intrinsic self&#8208;healing stretchable multi&#8208;layered electronics, which are promising beyond the field of energy storage, such as displays, sensors, circuits, and soft robots.

         <title>Towards Efficient and Stable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground&#8208;state and local&#8208;excitation state energies.








Abstract
In contrast to closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron&#8208;donating group is covalently attached to an electron&#8208;withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D&#8208;A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local&#8208;excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.

         <title>Ultrafast Coherent THz Lattice Dynamics Coupled to Spins in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step toward the optical generation and control of coherent THz spin and lattice dynamics in 2D antiferromagnets. A coherent hybrid phonon&#8211;magnon mode is triggered in the 2D antiferromagnet FePS3 by pumping below the band gap in the presence of an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS3. The laser&#8208;driven lattice and spin dynamics are investigated in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm&#8208;thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump&#8208;probe magneto&#8208;optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2&#160;THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long&#8208;range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2&#160;THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which is utilized to excite the hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway toward the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8211;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the 2D limit.

&lt;p&gt;A step toward the optical generation and control of coherent THz spin and lattice dynamics in 2D antiferromagnets. A coherent hybrid phonon&#8211;magnon mode is triggered in the 2D antiferromagnet FePS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by pumping below the band gap in the presence of an external magnetic field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The laser-driven lattice and spin dynamics are investigated in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm-thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump-probe magneto-optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2&#160;THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long-range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2&#160;THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which is utilized to excite the hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway toward the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8211;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the 2D limit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fibrillization of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables 19% Efficiency Pseudo&#8208;Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibrillization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO is realized by employing a conjugated fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphtalene that acts as the molecular bridge, which contributes to realize a power conversion efficiency of 19% in the pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction D18/L8&#8208;BO binary organic solar cell, featuring a high fill factor of 80% with improved charge transport.








Abstract
The structural order and aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) are critical toward light absorption, phase separation, and charge transport properties of their photovoltaic blends with electron donors, and determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the fibrillization of small molecular NFA L8&#8208;BO with the assistance of fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphthalene (FN) to substantially improve device PCE is demonstrated. Molecular dynamics simulations show that FN attaches to the backbone of L8&#8208;BO as the molecular bridge to enhance the intermolecular packing , inducing 1D self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO into fine fibrils with a compact polycrystal structure. The L8&#8208;BO fibrils are incorporated into a pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) active layer with D18 as a donor, and show enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and collection properties, leading to enhanced PCE from 16.0% to an unprecedented 19.0% in the D18/L8&#8208;BO binary P&#8208;BHJ OSC, featuring a high fill factor of 80%. This work demonstrates a strategy for fibrillating NFAs toward the enhanced performance of OSCs.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Polychrome Stereoscopic Luminescence Triggered by Resonance Energy Transfer between Carbon Dots&#8208;in&#8208;Zeolite Composites and Fluorescence Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system is successfully constructed by designing an efficient resonance energy transfer system in a 3D space, in which carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites act as energy donors and fluorescence quantum dots act as energy acceptors. The luminescence system can carry eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions, realizing advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing.








Abstract
Luminescence multiplexing shows promising application prospects in information security, yet even outstanding time division multiplexing can only carry limited luminescence information. Time&#8211;space division multiplexing can greatly expand the information capacity by simultaneously transferring luminescence information in both time and space dimensions. Herein, time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system has been successfully developed by designing a 3D luminescence system based on resonance energy transfer (RET), in which afterglow lifetime easily regulated carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites are used as energy donors and multicolor fluorescence quantum dots (QDs) as energy acceptors. Taking perovskite QDs (PeQDs) as example, by matching the energy donors with different afterglow lifetimes and the energy acceptors with different fluorescence colors, tunable afterglow emission of PeQDs with wavelength within 463&#8211;614&#160;nm and lifetime within 232&#8211;1500&#160;ms can be realized, in which the maximal RET efficiency reaches 95%. As a proof of concept, such novel luminescence system that carries eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions (time and 3D space) is successfully applied in advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing. This work opens a new perspective for the application of time&#8208;space integrated luminescence systems in advanced information multiplexing.

         <title>Bionic Engineered Protein Coating Boosting Anti&#8208;Biofouling in Complex Biological Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineered BSA@PSBMA protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate), PSBMA) is developed for surface&#8208;independent coating and to remove the intrinsic limitation of native proteins as antifouling coatings in complex biological environments. High&#8208;efficient resistance to various biofoulants in complex conditions is achieved through using a bionic &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; design to tune the interfacial interactions at the molecular scale.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein is engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA (PolySBMA conjugated BSA) can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsion of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>Single Zinc Atom Aggregates: Synergetic Interaction to Boost Fast Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniform dispersal of the high&#8208;loading Zn single atoms with short atomic spacing (&lt;1&#160;nm) on ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays (ZnN4&#8208;NC) are synthesized as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cubes composed of arrayed carbon nanotubes provide channels for fast mass transfer in Li&#8208;S batteries under high&#8208;load conditions. Moreover, the synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms further promotes the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. Consequently, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur electrodes arising from polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics due to their excellent applicability in atomic&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, nitrogen (N)&#8208;anchored SACs on the highly ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays are reported as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cube structure of the aligned carbon nanotubes can promote the rapid mass transfer under high sulfur loadings, and abundant single&#8208;atom active sites further accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms with interatomic distances &lt;1&#160;nm further accelerates the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. As a result, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding cycle stability with a high areal capacity of 5.6&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 7.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 (electrolyte to sulfur ratio is &#8776;3.7&#160;mL&#160;g&#8722;1). Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivers a high capacity of 953.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#160;C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li&#8208;S batteries.

Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivers a high capacity of 953.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at 0.1&#160;C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Checkpoint Nano&#8208;PROTACs for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs, NPRO) with phototherapeutic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation are developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. NPRO&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also degrade SHP2 to block the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), resulting in the activation of a synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Checkpoint immunotherapy holds great potential to treat malignancies via blocking the immunosuppressive signaling pathways, which however suffers from inefficiency and off&#8208;target adverse effects. Herein, checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) in combination with photodynamic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation to block checkpoint signaling pathways for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. These nano&#8208;PROTACs are composed of a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) and an Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (aPRO) via a caspase 3&#8208;cleavable segment. aPRO is activated by the increased expression of caspase 3 in tumor cells after phototherapeutic treatment and induces targeted degradation of SHP2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent depletion of SHP2 blocks the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), thus reinvigorating antitumor macrophages and T cells. Such a checkpoint PROTAC strategy synergizes immunogenic phototherapy to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, this study represents a generalized PROTAC platform to modulate immune&#8208;related signaling pathways for improved anticancer therapy.

A series of conjugated polymers by side chain engineering and used as additive, which enable a record power conversion efficiency of 19.10% and decent high FF of 80.5% in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
The morphology plays a key role in determining the charge generation and collection process, thus impacting the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs). The limited selection pool of additives to optimize the morphology of OSCs, especially for the emerging layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) OSCs, impeding the improvements of photovoltaic performances. Herein, a new method of using conjugated polymers as the additives to optimize the morphology for improving the photovoltaic performances of LbL&#8208;OSCs is reported. Four polymers of P&#63743;H, P&#63743;S, P&#63743;F, and P&#63743;Cl are developed with different side chains. These polymers exhibit poor performances as donor materials and additives in the BHJ devices, due to the unsuitable energy level alignment and unfavorable molecular interactions. By contrast, they can be served as efficient additives to optimize the PM6 fibril matrix for facilitating the penetration of BTP&#8208;eC9 and forming an intertwined D/A bicontinuous network with a vertical segregation. Such morphology is optimized by side chain engineering, which enables the progressive improvement of the charge separation and collection. As a result, adding a small amount of P&#63743;Cl as the additive, the optimized morphology contributes to a champion PCE of 19.10% with a high FF of 80.5%.

Heterostructural Nanolattice Capacitors
In article number 2208409, Julia R. Greer, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate density&#8208;variant nanolattices that exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength by &#8776;3.3 fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.

Microfabrication of Biodegradable Sensors
In article number 2207081, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers report a photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication process for bioresorbable devices. Consecutive application of sacrificial, adhesion and protection layers enable the use of delicate conductive and insulating bioresorbable materials through standard microfabrication processes. Using this approach, high&#8208;density passive electric components and chemical sensors critical for transient electronics and implant applications are developed.

Inter&#8208;Qubit Coupling
Due to their atomic nature, qubits based on electrons bound to phosphorus&#8208;doped silicon quantum dots have demonstrated strong inter&#8208;qubit coupling. In article number 2201625, Ludwik Kranz, Michelle Y. Simmons, and co&#8208;workers show how the inter&#8208;qubit coupling can be used as a metrology tool to determine the arrangement of phosphorus donors in two quantum dots. This technique allows for the optimization of two&#8208;qubit gates and is applicable for other dopant&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Stabilization and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into the recently emerged stability and activity enhancement strategies, widely applicable to the design and development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and organic synthesis reactions, is provided.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis are widely recognized as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy&#8208;band&#8208;enabled high&#8208;light&#8208;utilization efficiencies, exceptionally long charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length&#8208;facilitated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural, and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induce instability and an unsatisfactory activity due to the need for a coactive component to realize redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. The widely applicable stability enhancement strategies are first articulated, and the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis are then explored. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Review of Scalable Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) Synthesis for Present and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesis are reviewed, the challenges and opportunities for each method are discussed, and their relevance to emerging applications is contextualized. Maintaining stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 in the growing crystal and enabling stacking order between layers emerge as the main challenges. Advances in these aspects will inform/guide the synthesis of other 2D materials with &gt;1 constituent element.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is a layered inorganic synthetic crystal exhibiting high temperature stability and high thermal conductivity. As a ceramic material it has been widely used for thermal management, heat shielding, lubrication, and as a filler material for structural composites. Recent scientific advances in isolating atomically thin monolayers from layered van der Waals crystals to study their unique properties has propelled research interest in mono/few layered h&#8208;BN as a wide bandgap insulating support for nanoscale electronics, tunnel barriers, communications, neutron detectors, optics, sensing, novel separations, quantum emission from defects, among others. Realizing these futuristic applications hinges on scalable cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN synthesis. Here, the authors&#160;review scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer h&#8208;BN synthesis, discuss the challenges and opportunities for each method, and contextualize their relevance to emerging applications. Maintaining a stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 as the atoms incorporate into the growing layered crystal and maintaining stacking order between layers during multi&#8208;layer synthesis emerge as some of the main challenges for h&#8208;BN synthesis and the development of processes to address these aspects can inform and guide the synthesis of other layered materials with more than one constituent element. Finally, the authors contextualize h&#8208;BN synthesis efforts along with quality requirements for emerging applications via a technological roadmap.

         <title>Perspectives of 2D MXene Tribology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings.&#160;The most promising results in MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations are provided.








Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode theoretically enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density owing to its high capacity. However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high&#8208;efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe2O4 are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model&#8208;free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin&#8208;cluster model.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc shows it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster.

     alt="Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model-free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin-cluster model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;&lt;sub&gt;CW&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field-cooled and zero-field-cooled data below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non-zero imaginary component below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; shows it is in fact associated with a spin-glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D-m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D-m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic-scale understanding of magnetic frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Improved Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via the two&#8208;step sequential deposition show advantages of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Whereas, it is still challenging to implement this technique in the inverted PSCs. Here, an improved sequential two&#8208;step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.








Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

&lt;p&gt;A wearable device with self-healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost-effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point-of-care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self-healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor-based (FET-based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro-stereolithography-based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self-healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self-healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real-time in vivo analysis of disease-indicative biomarkers, this proof-of-concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self-administrable procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic defects in quenched lithium titanate anodes enable reversible extraction of Li ions that are unextractable in pristine state, thus facilitating these native Li ions to participate in electrochemical cycling, which leads to a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials is sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a versatile strategy of quenching is demonstrated, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Multimaterial Polymer Lattices via Graph&#8208;Based Print Path Planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph theory&#8208;based algorithm, termed Automated Eulerian Route Optimization (AERO), is developed to automate the embedded 3D printing of periodic and stochastic lattices with hundreds of struts. This integrated method is used to construct multi&#8208;material polymer lattices with tailored mechanical properties.








Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable the fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing is demonstrated. An algorithm is developed first that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. The effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and the effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties are then investigated. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prototypical gate&#8208;programmable memory that seamlessly integrates the functionality of both ferroelectric memristor and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET), in a vertical fashion is demonstrated. Its memristive characteristics can be quenched (enabled), by setting the Fermi level of MoS2 inside (outside) of its band gap via a top gate, yielding a gate programmable non&#8208;volatile memory for multi&#8208;bit data storage and more.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, is an emerging phenomenon in the 2D limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory is shown by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8211;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). Thus, it yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 is prepared via nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well&#8208;developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.








Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), and long cycle life (&gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable. The optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D PPY nanosheets is 219&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of knowledge.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.

     alt="Self-Assembled Asperities for Pressure-Tunable Adhesion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many applications require on-demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure-tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure-tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick-and-place material handling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick-and-place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure-tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self-assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull-off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick-and-place material handling. The approach in pressure-tunable adhesive design based on self-assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Manipulating the Formation of 2D/3D Heterostructure in Stable High&#8208;Performance Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray scattering is applied to investigate the structure evolution pathway of the 2D phase atop 3D perovskite. By manipulating the phase transition pathway, the gradient distribution from 3D to n&#160;= 2 and n&#160;= 1 phase is realized in final films which helps charge separation and extraction, finally concurrently boosted the device stability and efficiency.








Abstract
Manipulating the formation process of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, including its nucleation/growth dynamics and phase transition pathway, plays a critical role in controlling the charge transport between 2D and 3D crystals, and consequently, the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Herein, the structural evolution and phase transition pathways of the ligand&#8208;dependent 2D perovskite atop the 3D surface are revealed using time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray scattering. The results show that the ligand size and shape have a critical influence on the final 2D structure. In particular, ligands with smaller sizes and more reactive sites tend to form the n&#160;= 1 phase. Increasing the ligand size and decreasing the reactive sites promote the transformation from 3D to n&#160;= 3 and n&#160;&lt; 3 phases. These findings are useful for the rational design of the phase distribution in 2D perovskites to balance the charge transport and stability of the perovskite films. Finally, solar cells based on ambient&#8208;printed CsPbI3 with n&#8208;butylammonium iodide treatment achieve an improved efficiency of 20.33%, which is the highest reported value for printed inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

As a result, &lt;b&gt;ZS4&lt;/b&gt;-based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short-circuit photocurrent density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with &lt;b&gt;ZS4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper-electrolyte-based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst for the oxygen electroreduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is developed by virtue of high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis chemistry at above 1100&#160;&#176;C, which enables the regulation of atomic coordination structures of Fe centers and the elimination of non&#8208;coordinating nitrogen dopants producing detrimental peroxide byproduct.








Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interest as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress is made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, an effective strategy is developed to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100 and 1200&#160;&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproduct but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt;80% performance retention after 30&#160;h under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35 day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By printing highly shrinkable hydrogel scaffolds as templates via a low&#8208;resolution extrusion 3D printer, complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution are successfully fabricated. This technique is capable of manufacturing a wider range of material types and reveals the opportunity for hydrogel to assist 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to creating a wide variety of 3D structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, a new AM strategy is reported, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8776;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross&#8208;linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions. These rational coverings consequently lead to satisfactory anode stability for aqueous zinc ion battery.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;Recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microdroplets consisting of chiral nematic liquid crystals and silicone oil are synthesized, showing a large area of reflective colors compared with the spherical microdroplets. The reflective colors can be tuned by the chiral dopant concentration, the viewing angle, and magnetic field&#8208;responsive orientation of the droplets. Their suspension can be applied to&#160;self&#8208;recoverable displays, magnetic tracking, and data encryption.








Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, Janus microdroplets are synthesized through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8776;14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition.

&lt;p&gt;Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large amount of spent LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d-band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen-doped carbon. The Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d-band center. The Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2208061, Lukas E. Lehner, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and co&#8208;workers report the controlled nucleation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites at the liquid&#8211;air interface of the precursor solution. Restricting the initial crystal growth to the surface of the liquid results in highly aligned perovskite thin films with improved charge transport, enabling efficient solar cells with excellent stability.

All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The application of a lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has been hampered by its low electronic conductivity and the high reactivity of its lattice oxygen. In article number 2207234, Ruizhi Yu, Jiantao Wang, Xifei Li, Chandra Veer Singh, Xueliang Sun, and co&#8208;workers successfully address this by introducing an appropriate amount of conductive additives to the solid&#8208;state electrodes and manipulating the surface chemistry, realizing long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LLO&#8208;based ASSBs.

Cathode Materials
The cycling performance of regenerated LiFePO4 by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling. In article number 2208034, Zheng Liang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers report long&#8208;life regenerated LiFePO4 from the spent cathode. Fe&#8211;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions is suppressed by elevating the d&#8208;band center of the Fe. Therefore, excellent cycle performance of LiFePO4 is realized and this strategy provides a guideline for achieving good performance of regenerated LiFePO4.

Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesives
In article number 2207337, Chelsea Davis and co&#8208;workers show that pressure&#8208;tunable adhesives (PTAs) demonstrate variable adhesive separation forces depending on the application pressure used to form the interface. PTAs are formed by annealing a polymer film on a silicone surface so that it dewets, forming polygonal clusters. The large gray circle is the flat face of a cylindrical probe about to make contact with the PTA during a probe&#8208;tack adhesion experiment.

         <title>The Promise of Soft&#8208;Matter&#8208;Enabled Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which can arise from their bridging.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.
