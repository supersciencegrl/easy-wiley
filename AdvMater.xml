         <title>Tunable Interlayer Interactions in Exfoliated 2D van der Waals Framework Fe(SCN)2(Pyrazine)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial oxidation of 2D van der Waals frameworks causes their aggregation in solution, while remaining colloidally stable. Strong inter&#8208;sheet non&#8208;covalent interactions give rise to intense, broad&#8208;band visible light absorption. The absorption intensity, bandshape, and energy of this inter&#8208;sheet absorption band is highly tunable by controlling solvent and framework identity.








Abstract
2D materials can be isolated as monolayer sheets when interlayer interactions involve weak van der Waals forces. These atomically thin structures enable novel topological physics and open chemical questions of how to tune the structure and properties of the sheets while maintaining them as isolated monolayers. Here, this work investigates 2D electroactive sheets that exfoliate in solution into colloidal nanosheets, but aggregate upon oxidation, giving rise to tunable interlayer charge transfer absorption and photoluminescence. This optical behavior resembles interlayer excitons, now intensely studied due to their long&#8208;lived emission, but which remain difficult to tune through synthetic chemistry. Instead, the interlayer excitons of these framework sheets can be modulated through control of solvent, electrolyte, oxidation state, and the composition of the framework building blocks. Compared to other 2D materials, these framework sheets display the largest known interlayer binding strengths, attributable to specific orbital interactions between the sheets, and among the longest interlayer exciton lifetimes. Taken together, this study provides a microscopic basis for manipulating long&#8208;range opto&#8208;electronic behavior in van der Waals materials through molecular synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Toward a Radically Simple Multi&#8208;Modal Nasal Spray for Preventing Respiratory Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathogen capture and neutralizing spray (PCANS) is reported to prevent respiratory infections through a multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets and serving as a physical barrier against viruses and bacteria, while neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. In mice, PCANS shows nasal retention for &#8776;8 hours and offers pre&#8208;exposure protection against lethal viral infections.








Abstract
Nasal sprays for pre&#8208;exposure prophylaxis against respiratory infections show limited protection (20&#8211;70%), largely due to their single mechanism of action&#8212;either neutralizing pathogens or blocking their entry at the nasal lining, and a failure to maximize the capture of respiratory droplets, allowing them to potentially rebound and reach deeper airways. This report introduces the Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS), which utilizes a multi&#8208;modal approach to enhance efficacy. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA's Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre&#8208;exposure dose of PCANS leads to a &gt;99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily&#8208;use prophylactic against respiratory infections.

         <title>Iridium Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Ensembles Stabilized on Mn&#8208;Substituted Spinel Oxide for Durable Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited stability of single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a long&#8208;standing issue. Herein, an innovative strategy is presented to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles on Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4, which effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, demonstrating excellent activity and stability for acidic OER.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production via acidic water electrolyzers. However, the limited durability of most single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides under harsh acidic OER conditions, primarily attributed to excessive lattice oxygen participation resulting in metal&#8208;leaching and structural collapse, hinders their practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles (IrSAE) stabilized on the surface of Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4 (IrSAE&#8208;CMO), which exhibits excellent mass activity and significantly improved durability (degradation&#8208;rate: &#8776;2&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1), outperforming benchmark IrO2 (&#8776;44&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1) and conventional Irsingle&#8208;atoms on pristine&#8208;Co3O4 for acidic OER. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that Mn&#8208;substitution in the octahedral sites of Co3O4 substantially reduces the migration energy barrier for Irsingle&#8208;atoms on the CMO surface compared to pristine&#8208;Co3O4, facilitating the migration of Irsingle&#8208;atoms to form strongly correlated IrSAE during pyrolysis. Extensive ex situ characterization, operando X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies, pH&#8208;dependence activity tests, and theoretical calculations indicate that the rigid IrSAE with appropriate Ir&#8211;Ir distance stabilized on the CMO surface effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, thereby mitigating Ir&#8208;dissolution and structural collapse, boosting the stability in an acidic environment.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the key fabrication techniques for large&#8208;area perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), including spin coating, blade coating, inkjet printing, and vacuum thermal evaporation. The pros and cons of each method are discussed in detail, along with the latest advances in large&#8208;area PeLEDs development. Specific challenges are discussed and potential improvement strategies are proposed, all of which are crucial for scalable PeLEDs production. The goal of this review is to offer guidelines for overcoming the challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have shown promise for high&#8208;definition displays and flat&#8208;panel lighting because of their wide color gamut, narrow emission band, and high brightness. The external quantum efficiency of PeLEDs increased rapidly from &#8776;1% to more than 25% in the past few years. However, most of these high&#8208;performance devices are fabricated using a spin coating method with a small device area of &lt;0.1 cm2, limiting their commercial applications. Recently, large&#8208;area PeLEDs have attracted growing attention and significant breakthroughs have been reported. This perspective first introduces the pros and cons of each technique in making large&#8208;area PeLEDs. The advances in the fabrication of large&#8208;area PeLEDs are then summarized using spin coating and mass&#8208;production methods such as inkjet printing, blade coating, and thermal evaporation. Moreover, the challenging issues will be discussed that are urgent to be solved for large&#8208;area PeLEDs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enhanced Intramolecular Hole Transfer in Block Copolymer Enables &gt;15% and Operational Stable Single&#8208;Material&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of different synthetic protocols of block copolymer (BCP) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. The more phase pure direct synthesis BCP exhibits enhanced intramolecular hole transfer, leading to a record efficiency of over 15% for single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells together with excellent long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Recent studies on narrow bandgap all&#8208;conjugated block copolymer (BCP) single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have made unprecedented progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE); however, it still lacks understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these highly mixed materials. Herein, the impact of different synthetic protocols (direct synthesis (d&#8208;BCP) versus sequential synthesis (s&#8208;BCP)) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. Targeting the same BCP, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, it is found that the change in polymerization reaction leads to quite different optical and transport properties. The d&#8208;BCP outputs a record&#8208;high PCE of 15.02% for SMOSCs as well as enhanced operation stability under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which is significantly higher than that of s&#8208;BCP (10.33%) and even close to its bulk heterojunction (BHJ) counterparts. Detailed transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer (CT) and exciton dissociation in BCP. In together with morphology characterization, it is revealed that the d&#8208;BCP has more phase pure composition, enhanced molecular ordering, and higher intramolecular CT efficiency relative to those of s&#8208;BCP. These findings gain insight into both the structure and carrier dynamic of BCP and demonstrate the possibility of achieving high&#8208;efficiency and stable SMOSCs.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Controlled Ferroelectricity and Emergent Multiferroicity in WSe2 Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twisted tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers stacked along with monolayer graphene exhibit noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. Also, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior.








Abstract
Recently, researchers have been investigating artificial ferroelectricity, which arises when inversion symmetry is broken in certain R&#8208;stacked, i.e., zero&#8208;degree twisted, van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. Here, the study reports the twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers. The findings show noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. This twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity serves as a spectroscopic tool for detecting transitions between commensurate and incommensurate moir&#233; patterns. At 5.5 K, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior. The study offers insights into twist&#8208;controlled coexisting ferro&#8208;ordering and serves as valuable spectroscopic tools.

         <title>Hybrid Anapole Induced Chirality in Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface that induces hybrid anapole (HA) for achieving chiro&#8208;optical responses. By breaking the structural symmetry, the metasurface supports both first&#8208;order and pseudo higher&#8208;order HA, leading to enhanced circular dichroism and polarization control. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental study of anapole physics and have significant implications for nanophotonics applications.








Abstract
The interaction between light and matter, particularly chirality, plays a pivotal role in modern science and technology. Typically, metasurfaces achieve chiro&#8208;optical effects by coupling electric and magnetic dipoles in specific orientations. In this work, the design and optimization of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface is explored to induce hybrid anapole (HA) for optical activity. When the symmetry of the metasurface structure is disrupted, the design can simultaneously excite first&#8208;order and pseudo high&#8208;order HA under illumination with a specific circular polarization, both occurring within the same spectral regime. This results in high reflection for one circular polarization and a significant reduction in reflection for the orthogonal polarization, thereby exhibiting exceptional chiro&#8208;optical activity. Moreover, the HA&#8208;based chiral metasurface demonstrates strong polarization control capabilities, as verified by Stokes parameter analysis, revealing high birefringence and a pronounced dependence on the incident polarization angle. These results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of HA metasurfaces for advanced optical applications and polarization control, paving the way for new developments in chiral nanophotonics.

         <title>Mimicking Antiferroelectrics with Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferroelectrics are promising materials for applications in energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative&#8208;capacitance devices. This study demonstrates that antiferroelectric&#8208;like behavior can be electrostatically engineered in ferroelectric superlattices. An electric field induces a reversible transition from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric oxides are promising materials for applications in high&#8208;density energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative capacitance devices. However, the range of oxide antiferroelectrics available today is rather limited. In this work, it is demonstrated that antiferroelectric properties can be electrostatically engineered in artificially layered ferroelectric superlattices. Using a combination of synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, macroscopic electrical measurements, and lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy in parallel&#8208;plate capacitor geometry, a highly reversible field&#8208;induced transition is observed from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar to polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics, with corresponding polarization&#8208;voltage double hysteresis and comparable energy storage capacity. Furthermore, it is found that such superlattices exhibit large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dielectric responses without involving flux&#8208;closure domain dynamics. These results demonstrate that electrostatic and strain engineering in artificially layered materials offers a promising route for the creation of synthetic antiferroelectrics.

This study demonstrates that antiferroelectric-like behavior can be electrostatically engineered in ferroelectric superlattices. An electric field induces a reversible transition from a stable in-plane polarized state to a state with in-plane and out-of-plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar-to-polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiferroelectric oxides are promising materials for applications in high-density energy storage, solid-state cooling, and negative capacitance devices. However, the range of oxide antiferroelectrics available today is rather limited. In this work, it is demonstrated that antiferroelectric properties can be electrostatically engineered in artificially layered ferroelectric superlattices. Using a combination of synchrotron X-ray nanodiffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, macroscopic electrical measurements, and lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy in parallel-plate capacitor geometry, a highly reversible field-induced transition is observed from a stable in-plane polarized state to a state with in-plane and out-of-plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar to polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics, with corresponding polarization-voltage double hysteresis and comparable energy storage capacity. Furthermore, it is found that such superlattices exhibit large out-of-plane dielectric responses without involving flux-closure domain dynamics. These results demonstrate that electrostatic and strain engineering in artificially layered materials offers a promising route for the creation of synthetic antiferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Gelation of Graphene Oxide Dispersions via Mild Thermal Annealing: Implications for 3D Printing and Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild thermal annealing (MTA) process transforms graphene oxide (GO) into an additive&#8208;free gel, significantly enhancing its rheological properties. SAXS experiments reveal the microstructural changes during MTA. The graphitic domains developed through MTA promote hydrophobic attractions, inducing a network structure. Through 3D&#8208;printing and electrochemical experiments, MTA demonstrates potential as an optimal gelation method for GO.








Abstract
Herein, a mild thermal annealing (MTA) process is presented for additive&#8208;free gelation of graphene oxide (GO) dispersions. This process transitions the GO from a nematic liquid crystal phase to a random network structure, significantly enhancing its rheological properties by order of magnitude. This transition is facilitated by the diffusion of functional groups on the GO surface, which induces hydrophobic attractions, leading to a stable network structure. Employing rheo&#8208;SAXS experiments, detailed insights are provided into the microstructural changes of GO gel under shear stress, establishing a direct correlation between its rheological behavior and microstructure. The distinctive properties of MTA&#8208;processed inks are illustrated, seamlessly integrating with 3D printing, to yield a highly porous lattice structure that demonstrates promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode. The MTA process, an additive&#8208;free approach to gelation, maintains the inherent dispersion properties of GO while offering scalability. Thus, this method brings significant economic and environmental advantages compared to conventional gelation techniques. The findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of 2D colloidal network gels but also increase the potential of GO for a wide range of applications, from gas and liquid absorbers to electrodes for energy storage and conversion, and biomedical fields.

         <title>GraphBNC: Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Prediction of Interactions Between Metal Nanoclusters and Blood Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory&#8208;based tools and artificial neural networks are used to estimate the strength of interactions between gold nanoclusters and blood proteins based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The method is able to predict favorable binding sites utilizing the estimated interactions. The sites are validated with half&#8208;microsecond MD simulations, which demonstrate the stability of the predictions.








Abstract
Hybrid nanostructures between biomolecules and inorganic nanomaterials constitute a largely unexplored field of research, with the potential for novel applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Developing such applications relies critically on understanding the dynamical properties of the nano&#8211;bio interface. This work introduces and validates a strategy to predict atom&#8208;scale interactions between water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and a set of blood proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, and fibrinogen). Graph theory and neural networks are utilized to predict the strengths of interactions in AuNC&#8211;protein complexes on a coarse&#8208;grained level, which are then optimized in Monte Carlo&#8208;based structure search and refined to atomic&#8208;scale structures. The training data is based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AuNC&#8211;protein complexes, and the validating MD simulations show the robustness of the predictions. This strategy can be generalized to any complexes of inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules provided that one generates enough data about the interactions, and the bioactive parts of the nanostructure can be coarse&#8208;grained&#160;rationally.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Silole Hole Transport Layer for Efficient and Stable Lead&#8211;Tin Perovskite and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional hole transport material (HTM) PEDOT: PSS is a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability in Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work offers an alternative means toward efficient and stable Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs using a new multi&#8208;functional HTM Silole&#8208;COOH, demonstrating 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems while avoiding the stability concerns associated with PEDOT: PSS.








Abstract
Despite high theoretical efficiencies and rapid improvements in performance, high&#8208;efficiency &#8776;1.2&#160;eV mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generally rely on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL); a material that is considered to be a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability due to its acidity and hygroscopic nature. Seeking to replace PEDOT: PSS with an alternative HTL with improved atmospheric and thermal stability, herein, a silole derivative (Silole&#8208;COOH) tuned with optimal electronic properties and efficient carrier transport by incorporating a carboxyl functional group is designed, which results in an optimal band alignment for hole extraction from Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and robust air and thermal stability. Thin films composed of the Silole&#8208;COOH exhibit superior conductivity and carrier mobility compared to PEDOT: PSS, in addition to reduced nonradiative quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting losses at the HTL/perovskite interface and improved quality of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. Replacement of PEDOT: PSS with Silole&#8208;COOH leads to 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems, and long operating stability in ambient air.

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>A Novel Targeted Microtubules Transformable Nanopeptide System Yields Strong Anti&#8208;Prostate Cancer Effects by Suppressing Nuclear Translocation of Androgen Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MTN&#8208;sustained presence in prostate cells is essential for inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by effectively preventing AR nuclear translocation in prostate cancer. Moreover, this provides a groundbreaking approach, delivering long&#8208;term and continuous suppression of PCa with an emphasis on maintaining a high bio&#8208;safety profile.








Abstract
The extended use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may often lead to the progression from castration&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) to castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in prostate cancer. To address this, it is essential to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) as part of an effective disease&#8208;modifying strategy. Microtubules play a central role in facilitating AR nuclear translocation, highlighting their importance as a therapeutic target. In this regard, a designated as the targeted microtubules transformable nanopeptide system (MTN) is developed. This system is designed to disrupt microtubule structure and function through dual&#8208;targeting of prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and &#946;&#8208;tubulin. Initially, MTN targets prostate cells via PSMA and then specifically binds to &#946;&#8208;tubulin within microtubules, leading to the formation of nanofibers. These nanofibers subsequently induce the polymerization of microtubules, thereby disrupting AR transport. Notably, MTN exhibits efficient and prolonged suppression of prostate cancer across the spectrum from CSPC to CRPC, with a highly favorable safety profile in normal cells. These findings highlight the potential of MTN as a novel and promising approach for comprehensive prostate cancer therapy throughout its entire progression.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Narrow&#8208;Band Deep&#8208;Red Electroluminescence By a Soliton&#8208;type Dye Squaraine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaraine dyes typically exhibit narrow emission spectra due to their soliton&#8208;like electronic structure characteristics. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on soliton&#8208;type squaraine dye is prepared, overcoming the luminescence quenching induced by dye aggregation. The deep&#8208;red electroluminescence peak is located at 668&#160;nm, with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 0.10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Due to the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics, cyanine dyes typically exhibit spectral behaviors such as large molar extinction coefficients, narrow spectra, and high fluorescence efficiency. However, their extensive applications as emitters in electroluminescence are largely ignored due to their serious emission quenching in the aggregation state. Herein, it is reported a squaraine dye (a type of cyanine) SQPhEt. At different solution concentrations, the unusual decrease in full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) with increasing Stokes shift indicates the fluorescence quenching of SQPhEt in the aggregated state is because of the strong self&#8208;absorption effect. A sensitized device structure can help to reduce the doping concentration of dye, which can effectively suppress self&#8208;absorption. Benefitting from the large molar extinction coefficient of SQPhEt, even at low doping concentrations of 0.1 wt%, efficient F&#246;rster energy transfer can be achieved. The corresponding spin&#8208;coating sensitized device based on SQPhEt as the dopant exhibits favorable deep&#8208;red emission at 668&#160;nm with a small FWHM of 0.10&#160;eV.

         <title>Programming Hydrogen Bonds for Reversible Elastic&#8208;Plastic Phase Transition in a Conductive Stretchable Hydrogel Actuator with Rapid Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Density Energy Conversion and Multiple Sensory Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the energy conversion of hairspring, an intelligent hydrogel is developed to achieve reversible transformation between elasticity and plasticity through precise regulation of hydrogen bonds, enabling efficient energy storage and release. The hydrogel exhibits exceptional drive rate, high energy density output, and diversified sensing capability. This groundbreaking innovation paves the way for novel designs of smart hydrogel actuators.








Abstract
Smart hydrogels have recently garnered significant attention in the fields of actuators, human&#8208;machine interaction, and soft robotics. However, when constructing large&#8208;scale actuated systems, they usually exhibit limited actuation forces (&#8776;2&#160;kPa) and actuation speeds. Drawing inspiration from hairspring energy conversion mechanism, an elasticity&#8208;plasticity&#8208;controllable composite hydrogel (PCTA) with robust contraction capabilities is developed. By precisely manipulating intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the material's elasticity and plasticity can be programmed to facilitate efficient energy storage and release. The proposed mechanism enables rapid generation of high contraction forces (900&#160;kPa) at ultra&#8208;high working densities (0.96&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that modifications in the number and nature of hydrogen bonds lead to a distinct elastic&#8208;plastic transition in hydrogels. Furthermore, the conductive PCTA hydrogel exhibits multimodal sensing capabilities including stretchable strain sensing with a wide sensing range (1&#8211;200%), fast response time (180&#160;ms), and excellent linearity of the output signal. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional temperature and humidity sensing capabilities with high detection accuracy. The strong actuation power and real&#8208;time sensory feedback from the composite hydrogels are expected to inspire novel flexible driving materials and intelligent sensing systems.

         <title>Constructing Organic Phosphorescent Scintillators with Enhanced Triplet Exciton Utilization Through Multi&#8208;Mode Radioluminescence for Efficient X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimode radioluminescence process is developed by thermally activating the release of triplet excitons from organic phosphorescent scintillators. These scintillators achieve a maximum photoluminescence efficiency of 65.8% and a minimum X&#8208;ray radiation detection limit of 110&#160;nGy&#160;s&#8722;1, enabling efficient radiographic imaging with a spatial resolution of &#8776;10.0&#160;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
The development of organic phosphorescent scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency has attracted significant attention but remains a difficult challenge because of the inherent spin&#8208;forbidden feature of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced triplet excitons. Herein, a design strategy is proposed to develop organic phosphorescent scintillators through thermally activated exciton release to convert stabilized spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons to spin&#8208;allowed singlet excitons, which enables singlet exciton&#8208;dominated multi&#8208;mode emission simultaneously from the lowest singlet, triplet, and stabilized triplet states. The resultant scintillators demonstrate a maximum photoluminescence efficiency of 65.8% and a minimum X&#8208;ray radiation detection limit of 110&#160;nGy&#160;s&#8722;1; this allows efficient radiography imaging with a spatial resolution of &#8776;10.0&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This study advances the fundamental understanding of exciton dynamics under X&#8208;ray excitation, significantly broadening the practical use of phosphorescent materials for safety&#8208;critical industries and medical diagnostics.

The resultant scintillators demonstrate a maximum photoluminescence efficiency of 65.8% and a minimum X-ray radiation detection limit of 110&#160;nGy&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; this allows efficient radiography imaging with a spatial resolution of &#8776;10.0&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study advances the fundamental understanding of exciton dynamics under X-ray excitation, significantly broadening the practical use of phosphorescent materials for safety-critical industries and medical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ions&#8208;induced Assembly of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents an ions&#8208;induced crystallization method to synthesize perovskite dual&#8208;phase nanocomposites of CsPbBr3 and Cs4PbBr6. This approach enlarges grain sizes, reduces trap density, and improves both light extraction efficiency and electrical characteristics. Consequently, green perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a maximum external quantum efficiencie exceeding 30% and a narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, a cost&#8208;effective class of semiconductos, hold great promise for display technologies that demand high&#8208;efficiency, color&#8208;pure light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Early research on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites showed low radiative efficiencies due to modest exciton binding energies. To inprove luminescence, reducing dimensionality or grain size has been a common approach. However, dividing the perovskite lattice into smaller units may hinder carrier transport, compromising electrical performance. Moreover, the increased surface area introduce additional surface trap states, leading to greater non&#8208;radiative recombination. Here, an ions&#8208;induced growth method is employed to assembe lattice&#8208;anchored perovskite nanocomposites for efficient LEDs with high color purity. This approach enables the nanocomposite thin films, composed of 3D CsPbBr3 and its variant of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs4PbBr6, to feature significant low trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, enhanced light out&#8208;coupling with a corrugated surface, and well&#8208;balanced charge carrier transport. Based on the resultant 3D/0D perovskite nanocomposites, the perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) achieving an remarkable external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm with a narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of only 18 nm. This sets a new benchmark for color purity in high performance PeLED research, highlighting the significant advantage of this approach.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;2D Semimetals from Multi&#8208;Layer Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a generalizable approach for the on&#8208;chip synthesis of non&#8208;layered, nanometer&#8208;thick, quasi&#8208;2D semimetals from multi&#8208;layer chalcogenides. In the exemplary case, sub&#8208;20&#160;nm semiconducting InSe with nickel deposited on top are subjected to a low&#8208;temperature annealing step. This process enables a controlled transformation of the layered InSe into non&#8208;layered, crystalline Kagome&#8208;semimetal Ni3In2Se2 via reaction with the laterally diffusing nickel.








Abstract
Reducing the dimensions of materials from three to two, or quasi&#8208;two, provides a fertile platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena and developing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, growing high&#8208;quality, ultrathin, quasi2D materials in a templated fashion on an arbitrary substrate is challenging. Here, the study demonstrates a simple and reproducible on&#8208;chip approach for synthesizing non&#8208;layered, nanometer&#8208;thick, quasi&#8208;2D semimetals. In one implementation, this method starts with thin semiconducting InSe flakes of below 20&#160;nm in thickness with nickel deposited on top, followed by a low&#8208;temperature annealing step that results in a controlled transformation of the layered InSe to a non&#8208;layered, crystalline semimetal via reaction with the laterally diffusing nickel. Atomic resolution microscopy reveals the transformed semimetal to be Ni3In2Se2 with a Kagome&#8208;lattice structure. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this synthesis method is generalizable by transforming 2D layered chalcogenides such as SnS and SnSe employing Ni and Co to non&#8208;layered semimetals, paving the way for engineering novel types of devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency, Prevascularization&#8208;Free Macroencapsulation System for Subcutaneous Transplantation of Pancreatic Islets for Enhanced Diabetes Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency, prevascularization&#8208;free macroencapsulation system for the subcutaneous transplantation of pancreatic islets is developed. This novel system demonstrates excellent long&#8208;term blood glucose control at the subcutaneous site, even with the transplantation of &#8776;250 IEQ of islets. Furthermore, the system enables the local delivery of antifibrotic drugs, indicating its high applicability for islet xenotransplantation.








Abstract
Pancreatic islet macroencapsulation systems for subcutaneous transplantation have garnered significant attention as a therapy for Type I diabetes due to their minimal invasiveness and low complication rates. However, the low vascular density of subcutaneous tissue threatens the long&#8208;term survival of islets. To address this issue, prevascularized systems are introduced but various challenges remain, including system complexity and vascular&#8208;cell immunogenicity. Here, a novel prevasculature&#8208;free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro&#8208;shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate&#8208;based bio&#8208;ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug&#8208;loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.

         <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface&#8208;State&#8208;Mediated Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient current&#8208;driven spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching is observed in a hard ferromagnetic topological insulator (TI), V&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST), with a record large switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 k&#937; by current. The SOT efficiency is significantly enhanced by Fermi level tuning, as VBST exhibits a transition from edge&#8208;state&#8208;mediated to surface&#8208;state&#8208;mediated transport.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states (TSS) with ultrahigh efficiency. Here, efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST), with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field, is demonstrated. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 k&#937; is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems, which makes the Hall channel a good readout and eliminates the need to fabricate complicated magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structures. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to 2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high efficiency. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge&#8208;state&#8208;mediated to surface&#8208;state&#8208;mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to (1.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12)&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;T&#160;A&#8722;1&#160;cm2 and the interfacial charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency to 3.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3 nm&#8722;1. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices.

         <title>Reversing Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor&#8211;Associated Cardiotoxicity via Bioorthogonal Metabolic Engineering&#8211;Driven Extracellular Vesicle Redirecting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel strategy named bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8208;driven extracellular vesicles (EV) redirecting (Biomeder) is developed to relief ICI&#8208;induced myocardial toxicity. Biomeder possessed the capacity of in&#8208;situ editing tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEV) with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptide and transporting the engineered EV into heart. Redirecting TuEV enabled immunosuppressive metastasis of tumor microenvironment to the heart, which simultaneously improved the effectiveness and safety of ICIs.








Abstract
The cardiotoxicity induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with high mortality rates. T cells play an important role in ICI&#8208;induced cardiac injury. The inhibition of local T&#8208;cell activity is considered an effective strategy for alleviating ICI&#8208;related cardiotoxicity. Tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute to immunosuppression via PD&#8208;L1 overexpression. In this study, a bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8211;driven EV redirecting (Biomeder) strategy for in situ engineered EVs with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptides is developed. Accumulated tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEVs) reverses the immune environment in the heart by increasing PD&#8208;L1 levels in cardiomyocytes and/or by directly inhibiting T&#8208;cell activity. More importantly, it is found that the redirection of TuEVs further disrupts immunosuppression in tumors, which facilitates anti&#8208;tumor activity. Thus, redirecting TuEVs to the heart simultaneously enhances the antitumor efficacy and safety of ICI&#8208;based therapy. Furthermore, the Biomeder strategy is successfully expanded to prevent ICI&#8208;induced type 1 diabetes. This Biomeder technique is a universal method for the treatment of various ICI&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Nanosonosensitizer Optimization for Enhanced Sonodynamic Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review summarizes, discusses, and highlights the latest optimization strategies for nanosonosensitizers in sonodynamic therapy, emphasizing their high potential for treating tumors, bacterial infections, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune disorders. This review also discusses the biosafety and biocompatibility of these nanosonosensitizers for guaranteeing the clinical translation, which further provides an overview of facing challenges and emerging opportunities in nanosonosensitizer&#8208;enabled sonodynamic therapy, aiming to promote its clinical implementation.








Abstract
Low&#8208;intensity ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which, by design, integrates sonosensitizers and molecular oxygen to generate therapeutic substances (e.g., toxic hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, or singlet oxygen) at disease sites, has shown enormous potential for the effective treatment of a variety of diseases. Nanoscale sonosensitizers play a crucial role in the SDT process because their structural, compositional, physicochemical, and biological characteristics are key determinants of therapeutic efficacy. In particular, advances in materials science and nanotechnology have invigorated a series of optimization strategies for augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of nanosonosensitizers. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes, discusses, and highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art studies on the current achievements of nanosonosensitizer optimization in enhanced sonodynamic disease treatment, with an emphasis on the general design principles of nanosonosensitizers and their optimization strategies, mainly including organic and inorganic nanosonosensitizers. Additionally, recent advancements in optimized nanosonosensitizers for therapeutic applications aimed at treating various diseases, such as cancer, bacterial infections, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune diseases, are clarified in detail. Furthermore, the biological effects of the improved nanosonosensitizers for versatile SDT applications are thoroughly discussed. The review concludes by highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly evolving research field to expedite its practical clinical translation and application.

         <title>Flexible Neural Interface From Non&#8208;Transient Silk Fibroin With Outstanding Conformality, Biocompatibility, and Bioelectric Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the interactions between silk fibroin (SF) and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a robust and intertwined SF/PEDOT interface can be established. Leveraging this approach, a non&#8208;transient SF&#8208;based neural interface that possesses outstanding stability, conformality, biocompatibility, and bioelectric conductivity is developed. These features make it an ideal platform for the recording and monitoring of neural activities.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) with good biocompatibility can enable an efficient and safe implementation of neural interfaces. However, it has been difficult to achieve a robust integration of patterned conducting materials (multichannel electrodes) on flexible SF film substrates due to the absence of some enduring interactions. In this study, a thermo&#8208;assisted pattern&#8208;transfer technique is demonstrated that can facilely transfer a layer of pre&#8208;set poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) onto the flexible SF substrate through an interpenetrating network of 2 polymer chains, achieving a desired substrate/conductor intertwined interface with good flexibility (&#8776;33&#160;MPa), conductivity (386&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and stability in liquid state over 4 months simultaneously. Importantly, this technique can be combined with ink&#8208;jet printing to prepare a multichannel SF&#8208;based neural interface for the electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording and inflammation remission in rat models. The SF&#8208;based neural interface with satisfied tissue conformability, biocompatibility, and bioelectric conductivity is a promising ECoG acquisition tool, where the demonstrated approach can also be useful to develop other SF&#8208;based flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Single Atom Engineered Antibiotics Overcome Bacterial Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of manganese, tightly bonded to nitrogen&#8208;doped carboxylated graphene, exhibit potent antibacterial properties and bypass bacterial resistance development, even after thirty bacterial generations. Antibacterial activity is observed against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, as well as in in&#8208;vivo models, while the material is nontoxic to human cells.








Abstract
The outbreak of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, or &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, poses a global public health hazard due to their resilience against the most effective last&#8208;line antibiotics. Identifying potent antibacterial agents capable of evading bacterial resistance mechanisms represents the ultimate defense strategy. This study shows that &#8211;the otherwise essential micronutrient&#8211; manganese turns into a broad&#8208;spectrum potent antibiotic when coordinated with a carboxylated nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene. This antibiotic material (termed NGA&#8208;Mn) not only inhibits the growth of a wide spectrum of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria but also heals wounds infected by bacteria in vivo and, most importantly, effectively evades bacterial resistance development. NGA&#8208;Mn exhibits up to 25&#8208;fold higher cytocompatibility to human cells than its minimum bacterial inhibitory concentration, demonstrating its potential as a next&#8208;generation antibacterial agent. Experimental findings suggest that NGA&#8208;Mn acts on the outer side of the bacterial cell membrane via a multimolecular collective binding, blocking vital functions in both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The results underscore the potential of single&#8208;atom engineering toward potent antibiotics, offering simultaneously a long&#8208;sought solution for evading drug resistance development while being cytocompatible to human cells.

         <title>In Vivo Optogenetics Based on Heavy Metal&#8208;Free Photon Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo, optogenetics using photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation is demonstrated. The modification of a thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer with a bromo group promotes intersystem crossing and enables high TTA&#8208;UC efficiency at weak excitation light intensities even without using heavy metals. Air&#8208;stable UC nanoparticles exhibiting red&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC induce EGFP expression in the mouse brain.








Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) from red or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to blue light is promising for in vivo optogenetics. However, the examples of in vivo optogenetics have been limited to lanthanide inorganic UC nanoparticles, and there have been no examples of optogenetics without using heavy metals. Here the first example of in vivo optogenetics using biocompatible heavy metal&#8208;free TTA&#8208;UC nanoemulsions is shown. A new organic TADF sensitizer, a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative modified with a bromo group, can promote intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state, significantly improving TTA&#8208;UC efficiency. The TTA&#8208;UC nanoparticles formed from biocompatible surfactants and methyl oleate acquire water dispersibility and remarkable oxygen tolerance. By combining with genome engineering technology using the blue light&#8208;responding photoactivatable Cre&#8208;recombinase (PA&#8208;Cre), TTA&#8208;UC nanoparticles promote Cre&#8208;reporter EGFP expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. The results open new opportunities toward deep&#8208;tissue control of neural activities based on heavy metal&#8208;free fully organic UC systems.

The modification of a thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer with a bromo group promotes intersystem crossing and enables high TTA-UC efficiency at weak excitation light intensities even without using heavy metals. Air-stable UC nanoparticles exhibiting red-to-blue TTA-UC induce EGFP expression in the mouse brain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photon upconversion (UC) from red or near-infrared (NIR) light to blue light is promising for in vivo optogenetics. However, the examples of in vivo optogenetics have been limited to lanthanide inorganic UC nanoparticles, and there have been no examples of optogenetics without using heavy metals. Here the first example of in vivo optogenetics using biocompatible heavy metal-free TTA-UC nanoemulsions is shown. A new organic TADF sensitizer, a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative modified with a bromo group, can promote intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state, significantly improving TTA-UC efficiency. The TTA-UC nanoparticles formed from biocompatible surfactants and methyl oleate acquire water dispersibility and remarkable oxygen tolerance. By combining with genome engineering technology using the blue light-responding photoactivatable Cre-recombinase (PA-Cre), TTA-UC nanoparticles promote Cre-reporter EGFP expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. The results open new opportunities toward deep-tissue control of neural activities based on heavy metal-free fully organic UC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Control of Nickel Vacancies in Colloidal NiMgO Nanocrystals for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;inorganic Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal NiMgO nanocrystals with spatially controlled Mg are introduced as hole&#8208;transport materials for all&#8208;inorganic quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes. This novel approach enhances device performance, achieving a peak external quantum efficiency of 16.4%, a peak luminance of 269&#160;455&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a half&#8208;life of 462&#160;690&#160;h at 100&#160;nit, paving the way for more efficient and stable next&#8208;generation displays.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dot (QD)&#8211;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) have reached the pinnacle of quantum efficiency and are now being actively developed for next&#8208;generation displays and brighter light sources. Previous research has suggested utilizing inorganic hole&#8208;transport layers (HTLs) to explore brighter and more stable QD&#8208;LEDs. However, the performance metrics of such QD&#8208;LEDs with inorganic HTLs generally lag behind those of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid QD&#8208;LEDs employing organic HTLs. In this study, colloidal NiMgO nanocrystals (NCs) with spatially controlled Mg are introduced as HTLs for realizing efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic QD&#8208;LEDs. During the co&#8208;condensation of Ni and Mg precursors to produce valence band&#8208;lowered NiMgO NCs, incorporating &#8776;2% Mg into the NiO lattice creates additional Ni vacancies (VNi) within and on the NCs, influencing the hole concentration and mobility of the NiMgO NC films. Passivating the VNi exposed on the surface with magnesium hydroxide allows for tuning the electrical properties of the NiMgO NCs relative to those of an electron transport layer, allowing for a balanced charge supply and suppressed negative charging of the QDs. Optimized all&#8208;inorganic QD&#8208;LEDs employing NiMgO NCs achieved a peak external quantum efficiency of 16.4%, peak luminance of 269&#160;455&#160;cd&#160;m&#8315;2, and a half&#8208;life of 462&#160;690&#160;h at 100&#160;nit.

         <title>Untethered &amp; Stiffness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetic Liquid Robots for Cleaning Thrombus in Complex Blood Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a ferromagnetic liquid robot (FMLR) with tunable modulus (0.1&#8211;2018&#160;Pa) applied to thrombus removal in complex blood vessels is developed. Besides, in medical robotic applications, FMLR can be used in telerobotic neurointerventional. This study introduces an efficient approach for thrombus elimination, broadening the utilization of FMLRs within the realm of clinical medicine.








Abstract
Thrombosis is a significant threat to human health. However, the existing clinical treatment methods have limitations. Magnetic soft matter is used in the biomedical field for years, and ferromagnetic liquids exhibit tunable stiffness and on&#8208;demand movement advantages under magnetic fields. In this study, a ferromagnetic liquid robot (FMLR) is developed and applied it to thrombus removal in complex blood vessels. The FMLR consisted of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and dimethyl silicone oil. The FMLR can pass through a narrow complex maze through shape deformation by tailoring the intensity and direction of the external magnetic field. Finite element simulation analysis is used to validate the mechanism of controllable FMLR movements. Importantly, the storage modulus of FMLR can be tuned from 0.1 to 2018&#160;Pa by varying the external magnetic intensity, ensuring its effectiveness in removing rigid and stubborn thrombi present on the vascular walls. Toward medical robotic applications, FMLR can be used in telerobotic neurointerventional. Experiments demonstrating the capability of FMLR to remove thrombi in the ear veins of rabbits are conducted. This study introduces an efficient approach for thrombus elimination, broadening the utilization of FMLRs within the realm of clinical medicine.

         <title>Broadband Spin and Orbital Momentum Modulator Using Self&#8208;Assembled Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherulite structure with vortex spontaneous polarity possesses circularly anisotropic refractive index and second&#8208;order nonlinearity, boosting a range of linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including spin&#8211;orbit coupling and second harmonic sum frequency generation. Through these processes, single spherulite generates minimum three optical beams with desired spin and orbital angular momenta at wavelengths ranging from near&#8208;infrared to visible range.








Abstract
The structural symmetry of solids plays an important role in defining their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The quest for versatile, cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale, and defect&#8208;free approaches and materials platforms for tailoring structural and optical properties on demand is underway since decades. A self&#8208;assembled spherulite material comprised of synthesized molecules with large dipole moments aligned azimuthally, forming a vortex polarity with spontaneously broken symmetry, is experimentally demonstrated. This unique self&#8208;assembled structure enables new linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including generating optical vortex beams with complex spin states and on&#8208;demand topological charges at the fundamental, doubled, and tripled frequencies. This work will likely enable numerous applications in areas such as high&#8208;dimensional quantum information processing with large capacity and high security, spatiotemporal optical vortices, and a novel optical manipulation and trapping platform.

         <title>Confined Flash Printing and Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanofilms under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method, confined flash printing, allows for the rapid synthesis of perovskite nanofilms under ambient conditions. This approach combines precursor transfer, synthesis, crystallization, and polymer protection in a single step using a laser. The method's simplicity and flexibility support the development of various perovskite materials and devices, including applications in biodetection.








Abstract
The fabrication of stable perovskite nanofilm patterns is important for the development of functional optical devices. However, current production approaches are limited by the requirement for strict inert gas protection and long processing times. Here, a confined flash printing synthesis method is presented to generate perovskite nanofilms under ambient conditions, combining precursor transfer, perovskite synthesis, crystallization, and polymer protection in a single step within milliseconds. A laser simultaneously prints and induces the flash synthesis, confined in a polymer nanofilm, under normal ambient conditions. Due to its simplicity and flexibility, the method enables the combination and screening of many different perovskite precursor materials on various substrates. Besides for the development of novel perovskite materials and devices, the nanofilms can be applied for biodetection. The unique H2O2&#8208;responsive property of the ultrathin perovskite quantum dot film is applied for biomolecule detection based on oxidase&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Routes to Bidirectional Cathodes for Reversible Aprotic Alkali Metal&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the CO2 conversion reaction mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO2 conversion reaction kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship through calculation and experiment results, to provide routes to bidirectional cathodes for reversible aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO2 batteries and other gas batteries.








Abstract
Aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO2 batteries (AAMCBs) have garnered significant interest owing to fixing CO2 and providing large energy storage capacity. The practical implementation of AAMCBs is constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and the CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER). Because the CO2ER and CO2RR take place on the cathode, which connects the internal catalyst with the external environment. Building a bidirectional cathode with excellent CO2ER and CO2RR kinetics by optimizing the cathode's internal catalyst and environment has attracted most of the attention to improving the electrochemical performance of AAMCBs. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding. This review aims to give a route to bidirectional cathodes for reversible AAMCBs, by systematically discussing engineering strategies of both the internal catalyst (atomic, nanoscopic, and macroscopic levels) and the external environment (photo, photo&#8208;thermal, and force field). The CO2ER and CO2RR mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO2RR and CO2ER kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship are elucidated by combining computational and experimental approaches. This review establishes a fundamental understanding for designing bidirectional cathodes and gives a route for developing reversible AAMCBs and similar metal&#8211;gas battery systems.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion reaction mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion reaction kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship through calculation and experiment results, to provide routes to bidirectional cathodes for reversible aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and other gas batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aprotic alkali metal&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries (AAMCBs) have garnered significant interest owing to fixing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and providing large energy storage capacity. The practical implementation of AAMCBs is constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER). Because the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR take place on the cathode, which connects the internal catalyst with the external environment. Building a bidirectional cathode with excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR kinetics by optimizing the cathode's internal catalyst and environment has attracted most of the attention to improving the electrochemical performance of AAMCBs. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding. This review aims to give a route to bidirectional cathodes for reversible AAMCBs, by systematically discussing engineering strategies of both the internal catalyst (atomic, nanoscopic, and macroscopic levels) and the external environment (photo, photo-thermal, and force field). The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR mechanisms and the &#8220;engineering strategies from internal catalyst to the external environment&#8211;cathode properties&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER kinetics and mechanisms&#8211;batteries performance&#8221; relationship are elucidated by combining computational and experimental approaches.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of the Underlying Energy Storage Mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based Pseudo&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the pseudo&#8208;capacitive reaction mechanism of manganese dioxide (&#945;&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;supercapacitor is revealed in three ionic liquids by using in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy and further investigating the cycled product of macro&#8208;supercapacitor. The underlying faradic reaction mechanisms of pseudo&#8208;capacitance and superior performance are thoroughly elucidated through extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses, providing insights into the selection of electrolytes in &#945;&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (&#945;&#8208;MnO2) has attracted significant research interest in supercapacitors recently. However, the reaction mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in supercapacitors remains unclear. Therefore, a nano&#8208;supercapacitor using Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) is conducted and investigated the reaction mechanism of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 based on three ionic liquids (ILs). It found that in the aprotic ionic liquid (AIL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (EMIMOTF), &#945;&#8208;MnO2 nanowires (NWs) undergo an oxidation reaction due to the presence of an active proton at the second position (H2) of the imidazole ring. As a result, &#945;&#8208;MnO2 NWs undergo a phase transition and transform into Mn3O4, exhibiting pseudo&#8208;capacitive properties. Furthermore, characterization of the macroscopic &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrodes after cycling reveals that after the initial charging cycles, the dominant energy storage mechanism of the supercapacitor transitions from pseudo&#8208;capacitance to a dual&#8208;layer capacitance formed by the combination of Mn3O4 and unreacted &#945;&#8208;MnO2. Simultaneously, due to the coexistence of these two energy storage mechanisms, the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor in EMIMOTF electrolyte reaches up to 80 F g&#8722;1, and the cycle number reaches as high as 1000 cycles. The results are expected to provide insights into the selection of electrolytes in supercapacitors and offer a fundamental understanding of the internal reaction mechanisms in capacitors.

         <title>Homogenizing Energy Landscape for Efficient and Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual modification on both bulk and interface is proposed to homogenize the energy landscape throughout the entire blue perovskite by comprehensively diminishing the low dimensional phases and reducing the halide defects. Resultantly, perovskite light emitting diodes with spectrally&#8208;stable blue emission at 478 nm and a high external quantum efficiency of 21.9% are realized, representing a record in this type of devices. 








Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have attracted enormous attention; however, their unsatisfactory device efficiency and spectral stability still remain great challenges. Unfavorable low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution and defects with deeper energy levels usually cause energy disorder, substantially limiting the device's performance. Here, an additive&#8208;interface optimization strategy is reported to tackle these issues, thus realizing efficient and spectrally stable blue PeLEDs. A new type of additive&#8208;formamidinium tetrafluorosuccinate (FATFSA) is introduced into the quasi&#8208;2D mixed halide perovskite accompanied by interface engineering, which effectively impedes the formation of undesired low&#8208;dimensional phases with various bandgaps throughout the entire film, thereby boosting energy transfer process for accelerating radiative recombination; this strategy also diminishes the halide vacancies especially chloride&#8208;related defects with deep energy level, thus reducing nonradiative energy loss for efficient radiative recombination. Benefitting from homogenized energy landscape throughout the entire perovskite emitting layer, PeLEDs with spectrally&#8208;stable blue emission (478&#160;nm) and champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.9% are realized, which represents a record value among this type of PeLEDs in the pure blue region.

         <title>4D Printing Hybrid Soft Robots Enabled by Shape&#8208;Transformable Liquid Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of shape&#8208;transformable liquid metal nanoparticles (LMNPs) is first unveiled into 3D printing to create hybrid soft robots with controlled mechanical properties and deformability. This method allows direct printing of one&#8208;piece or assembled hybrid robots using a single LMNPs&#8208;integrated ink recipe, enabling precise control of mechanical and shape memory properties for applications like grippers, bioinspired motors, and rehabilitation devices.








Abstract
In recent years, soft robotics has emerged as a rapidly expanding frontier research field that draws inspiration from the locomotion mechanisms of soft&#8208;bodied creatures in nature to achieve smooth and complex motion for diverse applications. However, the fabrication of soft robots with hybrid structures remains challenging due to limitations in material selection and the complex, multi&#8208;step processes involved in traditional manufacturing methods. Herein, a novel direct one&#8208;step additive manufacturing (3D printing) approach is introduced for the fabrication of hybrid robots composed of soft and rigid components for sophisticated tasks. Inspired by the shape&#8208;transformable liquid metal nanoparticles (LMNPs), a functional material toolkit with tuneable mechanical properties and deformability is developed by integrating differently shaped gallium&#8208;based nanoparticles (GNPs) into the 3D printing polymers. Then the direct printing of assembled or one&#8208;piece hybrid soft&#8208;rigid robots is presented through a single recipe of GNPs&#8208;integrated inks. This fabrication method enables precise control of the mechanical properties and shape memory properties within the hybrid structures of robot body with a customized structure design. Their capabilities are further demonstrated through the design and fabrication of hybrid robots as high&#8208;precision gripper, bioinspired motor, and hand rehabilitation device.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Process, Fine&#8208;Grained, and Quantitative Rehabilitation Assessment Platform Enabled by On&#8208;Skin Sensors and Multi&#8208;Task Gait Transformer Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a full&#8208;process, fine&#8208;grained, and quantitative rehabilitation assessments platform (RAP) supported by on&#8208;skin sensors and a multi&#8208;task gait transformer model for patients with lower limb movement disorders. The RAP can perform multiple assessments including fall risk, walking ability, and rehabilitation progress, covering the whole process of rehabilitation and realizing objective and quantitative rehabilitation assessment.








Abstract
Rehabilitation of patients with lower limb movement disorders is a gradual process, which requires full&#8208;process assessments to guide the implementation of rehabilitation plans. However, the current methods can only complete the assessment in one stage and lack objective and quantitative assessment strategies. Here, a full&#8208;process, fine&#8208;grained, and quantitative rehabilitation assessments platform (RAP) supported by on&#8208;skin sensors and a multi&#8208;task gait transformer (MG&#8208;former) model for patients with lower limb movement disorders is developed. The signal quality and sensitivity of on&#8208;skin sensor is improved by the synthesis of high&#8208;performance triboelectric material and structure design. The MG&#8208;former model can simultaneously perform multiple tasks including binary classification, multiclassification, and regression, corresponding to assessment of fall risk, walking ability, and rehabilitation progress, covering the whole rehabilitation cycle. The RAP can assess the walking ability of 23 hemiplegic patients, which has highly consistent results with the scores by the experienced physician. Furthermore, the MG&#8208;former model outputs fine&#8208;grained assessment results when performing regression task to track slight progress of patients that cannot be captured by conventional scales, facilitating adjustment of rehabilitation plans. This work provides an objective and quantitative platform, which is instructive for physicians and patients to implement effective strategy throughout the whole rehabilitation process.

         <title>Unveiling the Cation Dependence in Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution by Differently&#8208;Charged Ruthenium/Molybdenum Sulfide Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics via water reduction limits the water electrolysis efficiency and depends on both catalyst structures and electrolyte cations. Herein, by hybridizing metallic Ru with differently&#8208;charged MoSx clusters, the interrelated effect of metal valence and charged support for the cation&#8208;dependent hydrogen evolution activity is demonstrated, in which the metal valence determines the water activation capability and the support determines the cation accumulation.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via water reduction limits the efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The HER kinetics is not only intimately related to the catalyst surface structure but also relevant to the cation identity of the electrolyte. The cation dependence also relies on the surface electronic structure and applied potential, but this interrelated effect and its underlying mechanism awaits elucidation. Herein, differently&#8208;charged molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) cluster supports ([Mo3S13]2&#8722; and [Mo3S7]4+) are utilized to hybridize with the identical metallic Ru centers. The specific electrostatic interaction between MoSx clusters and Ru precursors induces different Ru valences of the hybrids, with a higher valence state for Ru/Mo3S13 endowing a higher activity. The Ru/Mo3S13 and Ru/Mo3S7 exhibited drastically&#8208;different cation dependence, in which the charged support determines the local accumulation of cations and resulting water structures. The more negatively&#8208;charged Mo3S13 support induces the facile accumulation of cations, especially for less&#8208;hydrated K+ cations. The water activation capability by Ru valences and cation accumulation from the support effect in&#8208;together determine the cation&#8208;dependent alkaline HER activity. This work not only enriches the understanding about the cation&#8208;dependent HER mechanism but also shines a light on the rational optimization strategy of electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

         <title>Real Topological Phonons in 3D Carbon Allotropes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings indicate that among the 1661 3D carbon allotropes in the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA), 79 possess a phononic real Chern insulating (PRCI) state, 2 possess a phononic real nodal line (PRNL) state, 12 possess a phononic real Dirac point (PRDP) state, and 10 possess a phononic real triple&#8208;point pair (PRTPP) state, respectively. The real topology of PRCI, PRNL, PRDP, and PRTTP states in 3D carbon allotropes is manifested in the second&#8208;order phononic hinge states.








Abstract
There has been a significant focus on real topological systems that enjoy space&#8208;time inversion symmetry and lack spin&#8208;orbit coupling. While the theoretical classification of the real topology has been established, more progress has yet to be made in the materials realization of real topological phononic states in 3D. To address this crucial issue, high&#8208;throughput computing is performed to inspect the real topology in the phonon spectrums of the 3D carbon allotropes. Among 1661 carbon allotropes listed in the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA), 79 candidates host a phononic real Chern insulating (PRCI) state, 2 candidates host a phononic real nodal line (PRNL) state, 12 candidates host a phononic real Dirac point (PRDP) state, and 10 candidates host a phononic real triple&#8208;point pair (PRTPP) state. The PRCI, PRNL, PRTPP, and PRDP states of 27&#8208;SG. 166&#8208;pcu&#8208;h, 1081&#8208;SG. 194&#8208;42T13&#8208;CA, 52&#8208;SG. 141&#8208;gis, and 132&#8208;SG. 191&#8208;3,4T157 are exhibited as illustrative examples, and the second&#8208;order phononic hinge modes are explored. This study broadens the understanding of 3D topological phonons and expands the material candidates with phononic hinge modes and phononic real&#160;topology.

         <title>Constructing a Janus Catholyte/Cathode Structure: A New Strategy for Stable Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by membrane&#8208;less organelles in cells, a simple and versatile strategy is proposed&#8212;constructing a Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrode based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, in which redox&#8208;active organic molecules are confined in the liquid state within the activated carbon, thereby eliminating the volume effect and preventing their diffusion into the electrolyte.








Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for the electrodes of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries due to their nonmetallic nature, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they often suffer from significant dissolution during the charge&#8208;discharge process, which poses a major hurdle to their practical applications. Inspired by membrane&#8208;less organelles in cells, a simple and versatile strategy is proposed&#8212;constructing a Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrode based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, in which redox&#8208;active organic molecules are confined in the liquid state within the activated carbon, thereby eliminating the volume effect and preventing their diffusion into the electrolyte. The customization of phase separation systems by leveraging the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity differences of various anions is successfully demonstrated. This approach allows for precise regulation of ion cluster/coordination structures, enabling the confinement of active substances while ensuring efficient ion transport. Consequently, the as&#8208;constructed Zn||Janus catholyte/cathode cells exhibit superior reversible rate capacity (186&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and remarkable cycling performance (retention of 72.5% after 12&#160;000 cycles). The strategy in building Janus catholyte/cathode structured electrodes breaks free from the limitations imposed by traditional solid&#8208;state electrodes, offering tremendous opportunities for exploring diverse advanced battery systems.

         <title>Grain Boundary Filling Empowers (002)&#8208;Textured Zn Metal Anodes with Superior Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundary wetting strategy is demonstrated to completely fill the Zn grain boundaries, while simultaneously converting the initial random&#8208;textured Zn into a single (002)&#8208;textured Zn. Using In as the boundary filler, the as&#8208;received intercrystalline&#8208;modified (002)&#8208;textured Zn (IM(002) Zn) ensures homogeneous epitaxial Zn deposition and significantly mitigates the intergranular issues, resulting in excellent reversibility in various battery configurations.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn battery is promising for grid&#8208;level energy storage due to its high safety and low cost, but dendrite growth and side reactions at the Zn metal anode hinder its development. Designing Zn with (002) orientation improves the stability of the Zn anode, yet grain boundaries remain susceptible to corrosion and dendrite growth. Addressing these intergranular issues is crucial for enhancing the electrochemical performance of (002)&#8208;textured Zn. Here, a strategy based on grain boundary wetting to fill intergranular regions and mitigate these issues is reported. By systematically investigating boundary fillers and filling conditions, In metal is chosen as the filler, and one&#8208;step annealing is used to synergistically convert commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn while filling In into the boundaries. The inter&#8208;crystalline&#8208;modified (002)&#8208;textured Zn (IM(002) Zn) effectively inhibits corrosion and dendrite growth, resulting in excellent stability in batteries. This work offers new insights into Zn anode protection and the development of high&#8208;energy Zn batteries.

         <title>Giant Capacitive Energy Storage in High&#8208;Entropy Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics with Temperature Self&#8208;Check</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, octahedral tilt and cationic displacement are observed in high entropy (HE) BNT&#8208; based ceramics. On the basis of tape&#8208;casting process and cold isostatic pressing, the optimal ceramics display a large Wrec (10.46 J cm&#8722;3) at 685 kV cm&#8722;1 and a high power density (332.88 MW cm&#8722;3). Importantly, Tm/Yb codoping endows the ceramics with fluorescent temperature self&#8208;check feature.








Abstract
Considering the large demand for electricity in the era of artificial intelligence and big data, there is an urgent need to explore novel energy storage media with higher energy density and intelligent temperature self&#8208;check functions. High&#8208;entropy (HE) ceramic capacitors are of great significance because of their excellent energy storage efficiency and high power density (PD). However, the contradiction between configurational entropy and polarization in traditional HE systems greatly restrains the increase in energy storage density. Herein, the contradiction is effectively solved by regulating the octahedral tilt and cationic displacement in ABO3&#8208;type perovskite HE ceramics, i.e., (1&#8208;x)[0.6(Bi0.47Na0.47Yb0.03Tm0.01)TiO3&#8208;0.4(Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3]&#8208;xSr(Zr0.5Hf0.5)O3 (BNYTT&#8208;BST&#8208;xSZH). Combining the tape&#8208;casting process and cold isostatic pressing, the optimal BNYTT&#8208;BST&#8208;0.06SZH ceramic displays a large recoverable energy storage density (10.46 J cm&#8722;3) at 685&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and a high PD (332.88 MW cm&#8722;3). More importantly, due to Tm/Yb codoping, abnormal fluorescent negative thermal expansion and excellent real&#8208;time temperature sensing are developed, thus the application of fault detection and warning in high&#8208;voltage transmission line systems is conceptualized. This study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the polarization of energy&#8208;storing HE ceramics and offers a promising material for overcoming the problems of insufficient capacitor density and thermal runaway in terminal communication.

         <title>Robust Growth of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Vertical Heterostructures via Ammonium&#8208;Assisted CVD Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a universal strategy for robust growth of high&#8208;quality transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) vertical heterostructures and a novel design concept for the fabrication of high mobility and high responsivity photodetectors based on 2D TMD vertical heterostructures, which holds promise for the next&#8208;generation photodetectors.








Abstract
Two dimension (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) heterostructures have opened unparalleled prospects for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications due to their atomic&#8208;scale thickness and distinct physical properties. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is the most feasible approach to prepare 2D TMD heterostructures. However, the synthesis of 2D vertical heterostructures faces competition between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth, which makes it difficult to precisely control the growth of vertical heterostructures. Here, a universal and controllable strategy is reported to grow various 2D TMD vertical heterostructures through an ammonium&#8208;assisted CVD process. The ammonium&#8208;assisted strategy shows excellent controllability and operational simplicity to prevent interlayer diffusion/alloying and thermal decomposition of the existed TMD templates. Ab initio simulations demonstrate that the reaction between NH4Cl and MoS2 leads to the formation of MoS3 clusters, promoting the nucleation and growth of 2D MoS2 on existed 2D WS2 layer, thereby leading to the growth of vertical heterostructure. The resulting 2D WSe2/WS2 vertical heterostructure photodetectors demonstrate an outstanding optoelectronic performance, which are comparable to the performances of photodetectors fabricated from mechanically exfoliated and stacked vertical heterostructures. The ammonium&#8208;assisted strategy for robust growth of high&#8208;quality vertical van der Waals heterostructures will facilitate fundamental physics investigations and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Design Principles of Catalytic Materials for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous catalysts are the key for sustainable methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation. By overviewing recent advances in the most promising catalyst families, this perspective identifies generalized design rules centered around symbiotic interfaces integrating acid&#8211;base and redox functions and their role in performance optimization, proposing future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are essential for thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, a key route for sustainable production of this vital platform chemical and energy carrier. The primary catalyst families studied include copper&#8208;based, indium oxide&#8208;based, and mixed zinc&#8211;zirconium oxides&#8208;based materials. Despite significant progress in their design, research is often compartmentalized, lacking a holistic overview needed to surpass current performance limits. This perspective introduces generalized design principles for catalytic materials in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion, illustrating how complex architectures with improved functionality can be assembled from simple components (e.g., active phases, supports, and promoters). After reviewing basic concepts in CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, engineering principles are explored, building in complexity from single to binary and ternary systems. As active nanostructures are complex and strongly depend on their reaction environment, recent progress in operando characterization techniques and machine learning approaches is examined. Finally, common design rules centered around symbiotic interfaces integrating acid&#8211;base and redox functions and their role in performance optimization are identified, pinpointing important future directions in catalyst design for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>From Simple Probe to Smart Composites: Water&#8208;Soluble Pincer Complex With Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble tripyridine Zn complex featuring a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure exhibited multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to water, pH, and heat. Its composite with polyvinyl alcohol found versatile applications covering digital encryption, reversible writing, inkless printing, and fingerprint analysis.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble smart materials with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have garnered broad attention. Herein, a water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complex (MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc), featuring a simple donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure is presented, which responds to a variety of stimuli, including changes in solvents, pH, temperature, and the addition of amino acids. Notably, MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc functions as a fluorescence probe, capable of visually and selectively discriminating aspartate or histidine among other common amino acids in water. Additionally, when incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form the composite MeO&#8208;Tpy&#8208;Zn&#8208;OAc@PVA, the material exhibits reversible writing, photochromism, and a prolonged RTP with a 14 s afterglow. These unique properties enable the composite to be utilized in potential applications such as secure data encryption and inkless printing.

         <title>WS2 Moir&#233; Superlattices Supporting Au Nanoclusters and Isolated Ru to Boost Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maximizing the catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom and nanocluster catalysts is essential for their industrial application in water&#8208;alkali electrolyzers. A bilayer WS2 moir&#233; superlattices are reported that support Au nanoclusters and Ru single atoms (Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2) to enhance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Experiments and theories indicate that the improved HER activity stems from strong metal&#8211;support interactions in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2, promoting charge redistribution in the catalyst.








Abstract
Maximizing the catalytic activity of single&#8208;atom and nanocluster catalysts through the modulation of the interaction between these components and the corresponding supports is crucial but challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, a nanoporous bilayer WS2 Moir&#233; superlattices (MSLs) supported Au nanoclusters (NCs) adjacent to Ru single atoms (SAs) (Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2) is developed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the first time. Theoretical analysis suggests that the induced robust electronic metal&#8211;support interaction effect in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 is prone to promote the charge redistribution among Ru SAs, Au NCs, and WS2 MSLs support, which is beneficial to reduce the energy barrier for water adsorption and thus promoting the subsequent H2 formation. As feedback, the well&#8208;designed Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding HER performance with high activity (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;19&#160;mV), low Tafel slope (35&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and excellent long&#8208;term stability. Further, in situ, experimental studies reveal that the reconstruction of Ru SAs/NCs with S vacancies in Ru1/Aun&#8208;2LWS2 structure acts as the main catalytically active center, while high&#8208;valence Au NCs are responsible for activating and stabilizing Ru sites to prevent the dissolution and deactivation of active sites. This work offers guidelines for the rational design of high&#8208;performance atomic&#8208;scale electrocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing the catalytic activity of single-atom and nanocluster catalysts through the modulation of the interaction between these components and the corresponding supports is crucial but challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, a nanoporous bilayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Moir&#233; superlattices (MSLs) supported Au nanoclusters (NCs) adjacent to Ru single atoms (SAs) (Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Au&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-2LWS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is developed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the first time. Theoretical analysis suggests that the induced robust electronic metal&#8211;support interaction effect in Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Au&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-2LWS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is prone to promote the charge redistribution among Ru SAs, Au NCs, and WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MSLs support, which is beneficial to reduce the energy barrier for water adsorption and thus promoting the subsequent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. As feedback, the well-designed Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Au&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-2LWS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding HER performance with high activity (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;19&#160;mV), low Tafel slope (35&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent long-term stability. Further, in situ, experimental studies reveal that the reconstruction of Ru SAs/NCs with S vacancies in Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Au&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-2LWS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure acts as the main catalytically active center, while high-valence Au NCs are responsible for activating and stabilizing Ru sites to prevent the dissolution and deactivation of active sites. This work offers guidelines for the rational design of high-performance atomic-scale electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyroptotic&#8208;Spatiotemporally Selective Delivery of siRNA against Pyroptosis and Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision delivery and release of siRNA to inflamed tissue and immune cells could unleash its full therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases. A pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyrotosis, and exhibits therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Small&#8208;interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer promising prospects for treating pyroptosis&#8208;related autoimmune diseases. However, poor stability and off&#8208;target effects during in vivo transportation hinder their practical clinical applications. Precision delivery and adaptive release of siRNAs into inflamed tissues and immune cells could unleash their full therapeutic potential. This study establishes a pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) that selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyroptosis, and exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases. Novel hybrid nanovesicles (NVs) are designed as a combination of pyroptotic macrophage membranes (PMs) and R8&#8208;cardiolipin&#8208;containing nanovesicles (RC&#8208;NVs). Evidence provides that PM&#8208;derived proteins involved in cell&#8211;cell interactions and membrane trafficking may contribute to the specificity of NVs to inflammatory tissue. In addition, cardiolipin anchored in the hybrid NVs increases its affinity for activated gasdermin E (GSDME) and achieves pyroptosis&#8208;adaptive release of siGSDME for the spatiotemporally selective suppression of immune responses. More importantly, PMRC@siGSDME displays significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and therapeutic effects in multiple mouse autoimmune disease models, including arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Collectively, an innovative siRNA delivery strategy precisely tailored for pyroptotic cells has been developed, paving the way for new treatments for autoimmune inflammatory diseases with minimal side effects and wide clinical applicability.

         <title>Organic Crystals and Optical Functions in Biology: Knowns and Unknowns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals composed of organic molecules, mainly purines and pteridines, are produced by organisms to fulfill optical functions. Four levels of organization, molecular, structural, morphological, and superstructural, are examined to understand the optical, chemical, and biological principles of how such crystal assemblies manipulate light. This understanding may provide inspiration for new materials with tailor&#8208;made optical performance.








Abstract
Organic crystals are widely used by animals to manipulate light for producing structural colors and for improving vision. To date only seven crystal types are known to be used, and among them &#946;&#8208;guanine crystals are by far the most widespread. The fact that almost all these crystals have unusually high refractive indices (RIs) is consistent with their light manipulation function. Here, the physical, structural, and optical principles of how light interacts with the polarizable free&#8208;electron&#8208;rich environment of these quasiaromatic molecules are addressed. How the organization of these molecules into crystalline arrays introduces optical anisotropy and finally how organisms control crystal morphology and superstructural organization to optimize functions in light reflection and scattering are also discussed. Many open questions remain in this fascinating field, some of which arise out of this in&#8208;depth analysis of the interaction of light with crystal arrays. More types of organic crystals will probably be discovered, as well as other organisms that use these crystals to manipulate light. The insights gained from biological systems can also be harnessed for improving synthetic light&#8208;manipulating materials.

         <title>Emergence of Interfacial Magnetism in Strongly&#8208;Correlated Nickelate&#8208;Titanate Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superlattice pairing of strongly&#8208;correlated LaNiO3 and LaTiO3 triggers interfacial electron transfer from LaTiO3 to LaNiO3, leading to emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface. The quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensionality of this interface magnetism opens its potential utilizations in spintronic devices, and makes it resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates.








Abstract
Strongly&#8208;correlated transition&#8208;metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare&#8208;earth nickelates such as LaNiO3, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO3 into LaNiO3 leading to a high&#8208;spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order associated with this high&#8208;spin state has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x&#8208;ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering, direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface is presented. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin strongly&#8208;correlated quasi&#8208;2D antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilization in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi&#8208;2D magnetic correlations, orbitally&#8208;polarized planar ligand holes, and layered superlattice design make its electronic, magnetic, and lattice configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S&#8594;1 spin state instead.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Bioactivation of Inert Materials With Plasma&#8208;Polymerized Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional gas plasma treatments can significantly improve material properties for biomedical applications but are not applicable to important substrate classes such as proteins and hydrogels. Plasma polymer nanoparticles (PPN) are versatile functionalization tools compatible with aqueous systems, able to modify complex geometries that mimic the outcomes of plasma coating technology, but vastly expanding its applicability.








Abstract
Conventional gas plasma treatments are crucial for functionalizing materials in biomedical applications, but have limitations hindering their broader use. These methods require exposure to reactive media under vacuum conditions, rendering them unsuitable for substrates that demand aqueous environments, such as proteins and hydrogels. In addition, complex geometries are difficult to treat, necessitating extensive customization for each material and shape. To address these constraints, an innovative approach employing plasma polymer nanoparticles (PPN) as a versatile functionalization tool is proposed. PPN share similarities with traditional plasma polymer coatings (PPC) but offer unique advantages: compatibility with aqueous systems, the ability to modify complex geometries, and availability as off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf products. Robust immobilization of PPN on various substrates, including synthetic polymers, proteins, and complex hydrogel structures is demonstrated in this study. This results in substantial improvements in surface hydrophilicity. Materials functionalization with arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD)&#8208;loaded PPN significantly enhances cell attachment, spreading, and substrate coverage on inert scaffolds compared to passive RGD coatings. Improved adhesion to complex geometries and subsequent differentiation following growth factor exposure is also demonstrated. This research introduces a novel substrate functionalization approach that mimics the outcomes of plasma coating technology but vastly expands its applicability, promising advancements in biomedical materials and devices.

Electronic devices based on paper and banknotes are successfully developed using a solution process with PVK and SnO2 NPs. These devices display photosynaptic behavior under UV pulse illumination and achieved a 91.7% recognition rate using the Yale Face Database. For security applications, the 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibits excellent performance, maintaining the same code under long&#8208;term storage and bending conditions.








Abstract
Paper is a readily available material in nature. Its recyclability, eco&#8208;friendliness, portability, flexibility, and affordability make it a favored substrate for researchers seeking cost&#8208;effective solutions. Electronic devices based on solution process are fabricated on paper and banknotes using PVK and SnO2 nanoparticles. The devices manufactured on paper substrates exhibit photosynaptic behavior under ultraviolet pulse illumination, stemming from numerous interactions on the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles. A light&#8208;modulated artificial synapse device is realized on a paper at a low voltage bias of &#8722;0.01&#160;V, with an average recognition rate of 91.7% based on the Yale Face Database. As a security device on a banknote, 400 devices in a 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibited random electrical characteristics owing to the local morphology of the SnO2 nanoparticles and differences in the depletion layer width at the SnO2/PVK interface. The security Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) key based on the current distribution extracted at &#8722;1&#160;V show unpredictable reproducibility with 50% uniformity, 48.7% inter&#8208;Hamming distance, and 50.1% bit&#8208;aliasing rates. Moreover, the device maintained its properties for more than 210 days under a curvature radius of 8.75&#160;mm and bias and UV irradiation stress conditions.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Observation of Potential&#8208;Dependent Variations at the Surface of an Oxide Catalyst during Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying catalyst surface structure during the OER is vital for sustainable water electrolysis. A series of dynamic displacements, paracrystallization, and further amorphization are observed at the (001) surface in LaCoO3 under different overpotentials. Theoretical calculations also suggest lattice oxygen activation with extensive atom displacement induced at higher anodic potentials. This highlights significant variations in the degradation behavior of OER catalysts, strongly depending on overpotential levels.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate details of the surface atomic structure and composition of catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing catalysts with high stability in water electrolyzers. While many notable studies highlight surface amorphization and reconstruction, systematic analytical tracing of the catalyst surface as a function of overpotential remains elusive. Heteroepitaxial (001) films of chemically stable and lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;inactive LaCoO3 are thus utilized as a model catalyst to demonstrate a series of atomic&#8208;resolution observations of the film surface at different anodic potentials. The first key finding is that atoms at the surface are fairly dynamic even at lower overpotentials. Angstrom&#8208;scale atomic displacements within the perovskite framework are identified below a certain potential level. Another noteworthy feature is that amorphization (or paracrystallization) with no long&#8208;range order is finally induced at higher overpotentials. In particular, surface analyses consistently support that the oxidation of lattice oxygen is coupled with amorphous phase formation at the high potentials. Theoretical calculations also reveal an upward shift of oxygen 2p states toward the Fermi level, indicating enhanced lattice oxygen activation when atom displacement occurs more extensively. This study emphasizes that the degradation behavior of OER catalysts can distinctively vary depending on the overpotential level.

         <title>2D Photonic Colloidal Liquid Crystals Composed of Self&#8208;Assembled Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals comprised of biomineral/polymer nanorod hybrids dispersed in water are presented. These colloidal liquid crystals display vibrant structural colors with remarkable reflectance and pronounced angular dependence. The coloration is finely adjusted by modulating the concentration and size of the nanorods. Furthermore, these colloidal liquid crystals are immobilized in organic polymer network, showcasing mechanochromic properties with angular dependency.








Abstract
Photonic crystals, characterized by their periodic structures, have been extensively studied for their ability to manipulate light. Typically, the development of 2D photonic crystals requires either sophisticated equipment or precise orientation of spherical nanoparticles. However, liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) materials offer a promising alternative, facilitating the formation of periodic structures without the need for complex manipulation. Despite this advantage, the development of 2D photonic periodic structures using LC materials is limited to a few colloidal nanodisk liquid crystals. Herein, 2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals composed of biomineral&#8208;based nanorods and water is reported. The soft photonic materials with 2D structure by self&#8208;assembled LC colloidal nanorods are unique and a new class of photonic materials different from conventional solid 2D photonic materials. These colloids exhibit bright structural colors with high reflectance (&gt;50%) and significant angular dependency. The structural colors are adjusted by controlling the concentration and size of the LC colloidal nanorods. Furthermore, mechanochromic hydrogel thin films with 2D photonic structure are developed. The hydrogels exhibit reversible mechanochromic properties with angular dependency, which can be used for an advanced stimuli responsible sensor.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Light&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Polarization in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study visualizes light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in an &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323;/Te heterojunction using photocurrent mapping. The device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity with photocurrent enhancement up to 1000 times after polarization saturation. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2D ferroelectric materials for advanced photodetectors and optical information storage applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in 2D layered ferroelectric materials holds promise in photodetectors with multilevel current and reconfigurable capabilities. However, translating this potential into practical applications for high&#8208;density optoelectronic information storage remains challenging. In this work, an &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te heterojunction design that demonstrates spatially resolved, multilevel, nonvolatile photoresponsivity is presented. Using photocurrent mapping, the spatially localized light&#8208;induced poling state (LIPS) is visualized in the junction region. This localized ferroelectric polarization induced by illumination enables the heterojunction to exhibit enhanced photoresponsivity. Unlike previous reports that observe multilevel polarization enhancement in electrical resistance, the device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity enhancement under illumination. After polarization saturation, the photocurrent increases up to 1000 times, from 10&#8722;12 to 10&#8722;9 A under the irradiation of a 520&#160;nm laser with a power of 1.69 nW, compared to the initial state in a self&#8208;driven mode. The photodetector exhibits high detectivity of 4.6&#215;1010 Jones, with a rise time of 27 &#181;s and a fall time of 28 &#181;s. Furthermore, the device's localized poling characteristics and multilevel photoresponse enable spatially multiplexed optical information storage. These results advance the understanding of LIPS in 2D ferroelectric materials, paving the way for optoelectronic information storage technologies.

This study introduces light&#8208;triggered proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) nanoassemblies (LPNs) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis, persistently reprogramming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The LPNs, self&#8208;assembled from prodrug conjugates, deliver PROTACs and photosensitizers to tumor tissues. Subsequently, photodynamic therapy induces immunogenic cell death, while the recyclable action of PROTACs for IDO proteolysis enhances effector&#8208;T&#8208;cell activation and alleviates regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, inhibiting tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.








Abstract
While proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold great potential for persistently reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via targeted protein degradation, precisely activating them in tumor tissues and preventing uncontrolled proteolysis at off&#8208;target sites remain challenging. Herein, a light&#8208;triggered PROTAC nanoassembly (LPN) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis is reported. The LPN is derived from the self&#8208;assembly of prodrug conjugates, which comprise a PROTAC, cathepsin B&#8208;specific cleavable peptide linker, and photosensitizer, without any additional carrier materials. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected LPNs initially silence the activity of PROTACs and accumulate significantly in targeted tumor tissues due to an enhanced permeability and retention effect. Subsequently, the cancer biomarker cathepsin B begins to trigger the release of active PROTACs from the LPNs through enzymatic cleavage of the linkers. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death induced by photodynamic therapy to promote the activation of effector T cells, while the continuous IDO degradation of PROTAC simultaneously blocks tryptophan metabolite&#8208;regulated regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. Such LPN&#8208;mediated combinatorial photodynamic IDO proteolysis effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Collectively, this study presents a promising nanomedicine, designed to synergize PROTACs with other immunotherapeutic modalities, for more effective and safer cancer immunotherapy.

Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its high heterogeneity. This study introduces a triple&#8208;targeted protein nanoprobe capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, utilizing a data&#8208;driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology&#8208;based assembly strategy. It offers a potential strategy for guiding targeted nanomedicine design to overcome tumor heterogeneity.








Abstract
Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its highly heterogeneous molecular and phenotypic diversity. Herein, triple&#8208;targeted protein nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, through a data&#8208;driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology&#8208;based assembly strategy, are introduced. Specifically, to address the diversity of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), a combination of three targets, including C&#8208;X&#8208;C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is identified, leveraging machine leaning&#8208;based bioinformatics analysis and examination of LN tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using this identified target combination, ferritin nanocage&#8208;based nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to all three targets are designed through the self&#8208;assembly of genetically engineered ferritin subunits using a synthetic biology approach. Using these nanoprobes, multiplexed imaging of heterogeneous metastatic LNs is successfully achieved in a polyclonal lymphatic metastasis animal model. In 19 freshly resected human gastric specimens, the signal from the triple&#8208;targeted nanoprobes significantly differentiates metastatic LNs from benign LNs. This study not only provides an effective nanoprobe for imaging highly heterogeneous lymphatic metastasis but also proposes a potential strategy for guiding the design of targeted nanomedicines for cancer lymphatic metastasis.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Retinomorphic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. The synergy between the color&#8208;tunable hydrogels and Bi2S3 makes possible the color recognition at zero gate voltage. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is mimicked.









Abstract
Reproducing human visual functions with artificial devices is a long&#8208;standing goal of the neuromorphic domain. However, emulating the chemical language communication of the visual system in fluids remains a grand challenge. Here, a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables, e.g., color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. Based on the specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed chromogenic reactions, three multifunctional colored hydrogels are developed, which can not only synergize with the Bi2S3 photogate to recognize the primary colors but also synergize with a given polymeric channel to promote the long&#8208;term memory of the system. A synaptic array is further constructed for sensing color images and biomolecule&#8208;coded information communication. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is further mimicked. This work introduces rich chemical designs into retinomorphic devices, providing a perspective for replicating the human visual system in fluids.

         <title>A Dual Salt/Dual Solvent Electrolyte Enables Ultrahigh Utilization of Zinc Metal Anode for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) mixed solvents is designed to stabilize the zinc metal anode. The developed electrolyte with &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect enables corrosion&#8208;free zinc anode and fast zinc ion deposition kinetics. The zinc anode reversibility at ultrahigh utilization exceeds the performance recently reported.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#160;batteries&#160;are promising in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. However, the low zinc (Zn) metal anode reversibility and utilization in aqueous electrolytes due to Zn corrosion and poor Zn2+ deposition kinetics significantly hinder the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) solvents to achieve reversible Zn anode at an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) is developed. An &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect in this unique dual salt/dual solvent system is revealed. Experimental results and theoretical calculations provide evidence that the ether co&#8208;solvent inhibits water activity by forming hydrogen bonding with the water and coordination effects with the proton in the outer Zn2+ solvation structure. Meanwhile, the anion of zinc acetate co&#8208;salt enters the inner Zn2+ solvation structure, thereby accelerating the desolvation kinetics. Strikingly, based on the electrolyte design, the zinc anode shows high reversibility at an ultrahigh utilization of 60% DOD with 99.80% Coulombic efficiency and 9.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 high capacity. The results far exceed the performance reported in electrolyte design work recently. The work provides fundamental insights into inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent synergistic regulation in multifunctional electrolytes for reversible aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Bioinspired Photosensitizer Performs Tumor Thermoresistance Reversion to Optimize the Atraumatic Mild&#8208;Hyperthermia Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with pendant leucines is introduced to achieve rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors. CP&#8208;PLeu exerts a photodynamic effect to reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor antagonism and optimizing atraumatic mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy for breast cancer.








Abstract
Mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy (mPTT) has therapeutic potential with minimized damage to normal tissues. However, the poorly vascularized tumor area severely hampers the penetration of photothermal agents (PTAs), resulting in their heterogeneous distribution and the subsequent heterogeneous local temperature during mPTT. The presence of regions below the therapeutic 42 &#176;C threshold can lead to incomplete tumor ablation and potential recurrence. Additionally, tumor anti&#8208;apoptosis and cytoprotection pathways, particularly activated thermoresistance, can nullify mild hyperthermia&#8208;induced tumor damage. Therefore, a bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with leucine to form biomimetic nanoclusters (CP&#8208;PLeu nanoparticles (NPs)) aimed at achieving rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors, is introduced. Moreover, CP&#8208;PLeu exhibits photodynamic effects that reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor resistance to hyperthermia. With the addition of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, CP&#8208;PLeu optimizes the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT and contributes to a minimally invasive therapeutic process for breast cancer. This therapeutic strategy, utilizing a biomimetic photosensitizer for homogeneous distribution of therapeutic temperature and photoactivated reversal of tumor thermoresistance, successfully achieves efficient breast tumor inhibition through an atraumatic mPTT process.

&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with pendant leucines is introduced to achieve rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors. CP-PLeu exerts a photodynamic effect to reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor antagonism and optimizing atraumatic mild-hyperthermia photothermal therapy for breast cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild-hyperthermia photothermal therapy (mPTT) has therapeutic potential with minimized damage to normal tissues. However, the poorly vascularized tumor area severely hampers the penetration of photothermal agents (PTAs), resulting in their heterogeneous distribution and the subsequent heterogeneous local temperature during mPTT. The presence of regions below the therapeutic 42 &#176;C threshold can lead to incomplete tumor ablation and potential recurrence. Additionally, tumor anti-apoptosis and cytoprotection pathways, particularly activated thermoresistance, can nullify mild hyperthermia-induced tumor damage. Therefore, a bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with leucine to form biomimetic nanoclusters (CP-PLeu nanoparticles (NPs)) aimed at achieving rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors, is introduced. Moreover, CP-PLeu exhibits photodynamic effects that reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor resistance to hyperthermia. With the addition of NIR-II laser irradiation, CP-PLeu optimizes the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT and contributes to a minimally invasive therapeutic process for breast cancer. This therapeutic strategy, utilizing a biomimetic photosensitizer for homogeneous distribution of therapeutic temperature and photoactivated reversal of tumor thermoresistance, successfully achieves efficient breast tumor inhibition through an atraumatic mPTT process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tissue/Organ Adaptable Bioelectronic Silk&#8208;Based Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue/organ adaptable bioelectronic silk&#8208;based implants are devices fabricated on geometrically reconfigurable silk membranes for biomedical applications. Leveraging the unique properties of silk, these devices exhibit high biocompatibility and can deform into designed shapes to natively fit the target tissue/organ surfaces. Functions are integrated through processed silk and Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronic devices, designed for both monitoring and modulating living organisms, require functional and biological adaptability. Pure silk is innovatively employed, which is known for its excellent biocompatibility, to engineer water&#8208;triggered, geometrically reconfigurable membranes, on which functions can be integrated by Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) techniques and specially functionalized silk. These devices can undergo programmed shape deformations within 10&#160;min once triggered by water, and thus establishing stable bioelectronic interfaces with natively fitted geometries. As a testament to the applicability of this approach, a twining peripheral nerve electrode is designed, fabricated, and rigorously tested, demonstrating its efficacy in nerve modulation while ensuring biocompatibility for successful implantation.

         <title>Strong Elastic Protein Nanosheets Enable the Culture and Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells on Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid microcarriers are attractive solutions to enable cell culture in a scalable format, for stem cell manufacturing and applications in regenerative medicine. Here, iPSCs are cultured at the surface of microdroplets for the first time. This process is enabled by the self&#8208;assembly of strong elastic protein nanosheets that stabilize microdroplets, reinforce interfacial mechanics and engage cell adhesion receptors.








Abstract
Advances in stem cell technologies, revolutionizing regenerative therapies and advanced in vitro testing, require novel cell manufacturing pipelines able to cope with scale up and parallelization. Microdroplet technologies, which have transformed single cell sequencing and other cell&#8208;based assays, are attractive in this context, but the inherent soft mechanics of liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces is typically thought to be incompatible with the expansion of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their differentiation. In this work, the design of protein nanosheets stabilizing liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces and enabling the adhesion, expansion and retention of stemness by iPSCs is reported. Microdroplet microfluidic chips are used to control the formulation of droplets with defined dimensions and size distributions. The resulting emulsions sustain high expansion rates, with excellent retention of stem cell marker expression. iPSCs cultured in such conditions retain the capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. This work provides clear evidence that local nanoscale mechanics, associated with interfacial viscoelasticity, provides strong cues able to regulate and maintain pluripotency, as well as to support commitment in defined differentiation conditions. Microdroplet technologies appear as attractive candidates to transform cell manufacturing pipelines, bypassing significant hurdles paused by solid substrates and microcarriers.

         <title>&#8220;Bowling Collision Effect&#8221; of CoMo6 Polyoxometalate Units Enables Wide Temperature Range from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C and Dendrite Mitigation Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

The study explores Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates ([TMMo6O24]n&#8208;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe) as modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separators, enhancing performance. CoMo6 units show optimal binding energy and Gibbs free energy, forming strong polar bonds with LiPSs. The resulting Li&#8208;S battery exhibits high capacity, excellent cycle life, and stability across &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C, advancing high&#8208;performance, all&#8208;weather Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
To improve the performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, the reaction catalysts of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) reactions should have the characteristics of large surface area, efficient atomic utilization, high conductivity, small size, good stability, and strong adjustability. Herein, Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalate ([TMMo6O24]n&#8722;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe, represented by TMMo6 POMs) are used as the modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separator. By customizing the central metal atoms, this work gains insights into the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electron transfer mechanism between TMMo6 units and LiPSs, similar to the collision effect of a bowling ball. Theoretical analysis and in situ experimental characterization show that the changes of CoMo6 units with moderate binding energy and lowest Gibbs free energy result in the formation of robust polar bonds and prolonged S&#9472;S bonds after adsorption. Hence, the representative Li&#8208;S battery with CoMo6 and graphene composite modified separator has a high initial capacity of 1588.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, excellent cycle performance of more than 3000 cycles at 5 C, and uniform Li+ transport over 1900&#160;h. More importantly, this work has revealed the inherent contradiction between the kinetics and thermodynamics, achieving a stable cycle in the temperature range of &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Ultrahigh Responsivity and Robust Semiconducting Fiber Enabled by Molecular Soldering&#8208;Governed Defect Engineering for Smart Textile Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale structural defects in wet&#8208;spun MoS2 semiconducting fibers, which affords two orders of magnitude enhancement in responsivity and remarkable mechanical robustness, thus enabling large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Semiconducting fibers (SCFs) are of significant interest to design next&#8208;generation wearable and comfortable optoelectronics that seamlessly integrate with textiles. However, the practical applications of current SCFs are always limited by poor optoelectronic performance and low mechanical robustness caused by uncontrollable multiscale structural defects. Herein, a versatile in situ molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to construct ultrahigh responsivity and robust wet&#8208;spun MoS2 SCFs, by using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated dithiolated molecule to simultaneously patch microscale sulfur vacancies within MoS2 nanosheets, diminish mesoscale interlayer voids/wrinkles, promote macroscale orientation, build long&#8208;range photoelectron percolation bridges, and provide n&#8208;doping effect. The derived MoS2 SCFs exhibit over two orders of magnitude higher responsivity (144.3 A W&#8722;1) than previously reported fiber photodetectors, 37.3&#8208;fold faster photoresponse speed (52&#160;ms) than pristine counterpart, and remarkable bending robustness (retain 94.2% of the initial photocurrent after 50&#160;000 bending&#8208;flattening cycles). Such superior robustness and photodetection capacity of MoS2 SCFs further enable large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems, such as direction&#8208;identifiable wireless light alarming system, modularized mechano&#8208;optical communication system, and indoor light&#8208;controlled IoT system. This work offers a universal strategy for the scalable production of mechanically robust and high&#8208;performance SCFs, opening up exciting possibilities for large&#8208;scale integration of wearable optoelectronics.

The derived MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SCFs exhibit over two orders of magnitude higher responsivity (144.3 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than previously reported fiber photodetectors, 37.3-fold faster photoresponse speed (52&#160;ms) than pristine counterpart, and remarkable bending robustness (retain 94.2% of the initial photocurrent after 50&#160;000 bending-flattening cycles). Such superior robustness and photodetection capacity of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SCFs further enable large-scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems, such as direction-identifiable wireless light alarming system, modularized mechano-optical communication system, and indoor light-controlled IoT system. This work offers a universal strategy for the scalable production of mechanically robust and high-performance SCFs, opening up exciting possibilities for large-scale integration of wearable optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Generalized Coordination Engineering Strategy for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the generalized coordination engineering strategy, the representative samples Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S are precisely synthesized, and both of them present excellent activity and H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;90%) compared with conventional Metal&#8208;N4 configurations. Moreover, they enable a high H2O2 production of 14.2 and 17.5 moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the three&#8208;phrase flow cell and maintain a satisfying stability over 12&#160;h.








Abstract
Designing non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR) is attractive for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis, in which the coordination configuration of the M&#8208;SACs essentially affects the reaction activity and product selectivity. Though extensively investigated, a generalized coordination engineering strategy has not yet been proposed, which fundamentally hinders the rational design of M&#8208;SACs with optimized catalytic capabilities. Herein, a generalized coordination engineering strategy is proposed for M&#8208;SACs toward H2O2 electrosynthesis via introducing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or sulfur atoms) with higher or lower electronegativity than nitrogen atoms into the first sphere of metal&#8208;N4 system to tailor their electronic structure and adjust the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates, respectively, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic capability for 2e&#8208;ORR. Specifically, the (O, N)&#8208;coordinated Co SAC (Co&#8208;N3O) and (S, N)&#8208;coordinated Ni SAC (Ni&#8208;N3S) are precisely synthesized, and both present superior 2e&#8208;ORR activity (Eonset: &#8776;0.80&#160;V versus RHE) and selectivity (&#8776;90%) in alkaline conditions compared with conventional Co&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 sites. The high H2O2 yield rates of 14.2 and 17.5&#160;moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability over 12&#160;h are respectively achieved for Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S. Such favorable 2e&#8208;ORR pathway of the catalysts is also theoretically confirmed by the kinetics simulations.

         <title>Highly Robust and Self&#8208;Adhesive Soft Strain Gauge via Interface Design Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayer soft strain gauges with strong and tough interfacial interactions are designed. Stable interface connections within the soft strain gauge allow for both high performance strain sensing and excellent mechanical/electrical robustness. The soft strain gauge's self&#8208;adhesive layer ensures seamless integration into complex dynamic surfaces for stable and fidelity signal acquisition.








Abstract
Highly robust soft strain gauges are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate in the fields of vital signs and machine conditions monitoring. However, it is still a key challenge to achieve high&#8208;performance strain sensing in these sensors with mechanical/electrical robustness for long&#8208;term usage. The multilayer structural design of sensors enhances sensing performance while the interfacial connection of heterogeneous materials between different layers is weak. Herein, inspired by the efficient perception mechanism of scorpion slit sensilla with tough interface interconnections, the synergy of ultra&#8208;high electrical performance and mechanical robustness is successfully achieved via interface design engineering. The developed multilayer soft strain gauge (MSSG) exhibits a strain sensitivity beyond 105, a lower detection limit of 8.3&#160;&#181;m, a frequency resolution within 0.1&#160;Hz, and cyclic stability over 63&#160;000 strain cycles. Also, the tough interface improves the level of heterogeneous integration in the MSSG which allows to endure different stresses. Furthermore, an MSSG&#8208;based wireless strain monitoring system is developed that enables applications on different complex dynamic surfaces, including accurate identification of human throat activity and monitoring of rolling bearing conditions.

Abstract
Chronic nonhealing skin wounds, characterized by reduced tissue contractility and inhibited wound cell survival under hyperglycemia and hypoxia, present a significant challenge in diabetic care. Here, an advanced self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8208;shell microgel assembly with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion (SMART&#8208;EXO) is introduced to expedite diabetic wound healing. The SMART&#8208;EXO dressing exhibits strong, reversible adhesion to damaged tissue due to abundant hydrogen and dynamic coordination bonds. Additionally, the core&#8208;shell microgel components and dynamic coordination bonds provide moderate rigidity, customizable self&#8208;contraction, and an interlinked porous architecture. The triggered in situ self&#8208;contraction of the SMART&#8208;EXO dressing enables active, tunable wound contraction, activating mechanotransduction in the skin and promoting the optimal fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. Concurrently, the triggered contraction of SMART&#8208;EXO facilitates efficient loading and on&#8208;demand release of bioactive exosomes, contributing to re&#8208;epithelialization and wound microenvironment regulation in diabetic mice. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal the activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the combined biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms. These findings underscore SMART&#8208;EXO as a versatile, adaptable solution to the complex challenges of diabetic wound care.

         <title>Interstitial Optical Fiber&#8208;Mediated Multimodal Phototheranostics Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;II Emission Luminogen for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy combining one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic molecules with a modified optical fiber is developed to efficiently implement both second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation&#8208;triggered phototherapy for orthotopic breast tumors. Histological analysis results demonstrate thorough and complete tumor damage induced by the optical fiber&#8208;mediated phototherapy, in sharp contrast to the shallow treatment effect in a conventional manner.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics based on a single molecule is recognized as a convenient approach for cancer treatment, whose efficacy relies on precise lesion localization through multimodal imaging, coupled with the efficient exertion of phototherapy. To unleash the full potential of phototheranostics, advancement in both phototheranostic agents and light delivery methods is essential. Herein, an integrated strategy combining a versatile molecule featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely tBuTTBD, with a modified optical fiber to realize comprehensive tumor diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation in the orthotopic breast tumor, is proposed for the first time. Attributed to the intense donor&#8208;acceptor interaction, highly distorted conformation, abundant molecular rotors, and loose intermolecular packing upon aggregation, tBuTTBD can synchronously undergo second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission, photothermal and photodynamic generation under laser irradiation, contributing to a trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic (PA)&#8208;photothermal imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy. The tumor treatment is further carried out following the insertion of a modified optical fiber, which is fabricated by splicing a flat&#8208;end fiber with an air&#8208;core fiber. This configuration aims to enable effective in situ phototherapy by maximizing energy utilization for therapeutic benefits. This work not only enriches the palette of NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents but also provides valuable insight for exploring an integrated phototheranostic protocol for practical cancer treatment.

To unleash the full potential of phototheranostics, advancement in both phototheranostic agents and light delivery methods is essential. Herein, an integrated strategy combining a versatile molecule featuring aggregation-induced emission, namely tBuTTBD, with a modified optical fiber to realize comprehensive tumor diagnosis and &#8220;inside-out&#8221; irradiation in the orthotopic breast tumor, is proposed for the first time. Attributed to the intense donor-acceptor interaction, highly distorted conformation, abundant molecular rotors, and loose intermolecular packing upon aggregation, tBuTTBD can synchronously undergo second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission, photothermal and photodynamic generation under laser irradiation, contributing to a trimodal NIR-II fluorescence-photoacoustic (PA)-photothermal imaging-guided phototherapy. The tumor treatment is further carried out following the insertion of a modified optical fiber, which is fabricated by splicing a flat-end fiber with an air-core fiber. This configuration aims to enable effective in situ phototherapy by maximizing energy utilization for therapeutic benefits. This work not only enriches the palette of NIR-II phototheranostic agents but also provides valuable insight for exploring an integrated phototheranostic protocol for practical cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Interfacial Charge Extraction by Bridging Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is utilized to modify the buried SnO2/perovskite interface in PSCs. The dual functionality of AEP with adjacent interface leads to significant benefits such as defects suppression, increased film quality, and interfacial charge extraction improvement. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified at 25.98%) is achieved with &#8776;1400 h operational durability.








Abstract
The interface between the perovskite layer and electron transporting layer is a critical determinate for the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The heterogeneity of the interface critically affects the carrier dynamics at the buried interface. To address this, a bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is introduced for the modification of SnO2/perovskite buried interface in n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure PSCs. The phosphonic acid group strongly bonds to the SnO2 surface, effectively suppressing the surface carrier traps and leakage current, and uniforming the surface potential. Meanwhile, the amino group influences the growth of perovskite film, resulting in higher crystallinity, phase purity, and fewer defects. Furthermore, the bridging molecules facilitate the charge extraction at the interface, as indicated by the femtosecond transient reflection (fs&#8208;TR) spectroscopy, leading to champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified 25.98%) for PSCs. Additionally, the strengthened interface enables improved operational durability of &#8776;1400 h for the unencapsulated PSCs under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1I protocol.

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;Assembly with Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Characteristics for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising chiral co&#8208;assemblies featuring CPL amplification are achieved by thermal annealing of assembled host, chiral inducers, and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance acceptor. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those co&#8208;assemblies exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance, such as gEL of 0.16, EQEmax of 4.6%, and FWHM of 39 nm, which are the best among all reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.








Abstract
A promising kind of ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies with high PLQY, large dissymmetry factor (glum), and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance characteristics are achieved by codoped&#8208;thermal annealing treatments of achiral luminescent polymer F8BT, chiral inducers R/S&#8208;5011, and achiral FRET acceptor DBN&#8208;ICZ. The optimized co&#8208;assemblies (F8BT)0.9&#8208;(R/S&#8208;5011)0.1&#8208;(DBN&#8208;ICZ)0.005 display narrowband yellow emission with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 37 nm, PLQY of 79%, and intense CPL signals with |glum| of up to 0.26. Meaningfully, solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs by using those ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies as emitting layer are successfully fabricated, which display yellow circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with EQEmax of 4.6% and gEL of up to 0.16. The corresponding Q&#8208;factor could reach up to 7.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3, which is the highest of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs. Moreover, the devices also exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance with low Von of 7.0 V, high Lmax of about 25&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQE of 4.3% at 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, as well as narrowband EL with FWHM of only 39 nm. The proposed ternary co&#8208;assembly strategy in fabricating CP&#8208;OLED provides the possibility to achieve high comprehensive device performance such as balancing high EQE and large gEL value, as well as narrowband emission, high brightness and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously.

         <title>Near Infrared&#8208;Fluorescent Dinuclear Iridium(III) Nanoparticles for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;triggered, near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is reported to precisely and spatiotemporally generate reactive oxygen species for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy. Upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, NanoIr inhibits tumor growth in CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mice and elicits synergistic effects with the clinically approved chemotherapy drug cisplatin in patient&#8208;derived xenograft models of ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Dinuclear iridium(III) complexes activated by light&#8208;inducible spatiotemporal control are emerging as promising candidates for cancer therapy. However, broader applications of current light&#8208;activated dinuclear iridium(III) complexes are limited by the ineffective tissue penetration and undesirable feedback on guidance activation. Here, an ultrasound (US) triggered near infrared&#8208;fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is first reported to precisely and spatiotemporally inhibit tumor growth. It is demonstrated that reactive oxygen species can be generated by NanoIr upon exposure to US irradiation (NanoIr + US), thereby inducing immunogenic cell death. When combined with cisplatin, NanoIr + US elicits synergistic effects in patient&#8208;derived tumor xenograft mice models of ovarian cancer. This work first provides a design of dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticles for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy.

         <title>Fully Degradable Polyphosphoester Cubosomes for Sustainable Agrochemical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need to address microplastic pollution and promote sustainable agriculture has driven the development of fully degradable carriers for agrochemicals. A novel self&#8208;assembly method is introduced to produce porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), which are mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm), and loaded with fungicides for effective release. These PCs show high antimycotic activity, adhere to leaves despite rain, and fully degrade into non&#8208;toxic byproducts, offering a promising solution for microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution and the urgent need for sustainable agriculture have raised interest in developing degradable carriers for controlled agrochemical release. Porous polymeric particles are particularly promising due to their unique release profiles compared to solid or core&#8208;shell carriers. However, creating degradable, mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm) microparticles is challenging, and their potential for agrochemical delivery is largely unexplored.
A straightforward self&#8208;assembly method is demonstrated for fully degradable porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), showcasing their ability to load and release agrochemicals. Using fully degradable block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide (PEEP&#8208;b&#8208;PLA), PCs are synthesized in water with high inner order and open pores averaging 19 &#177; 3 nm in diameter. During the self&#8208;assembly process in the presence of the hydrophobic fungicide tebuconazole, polymersomes transform into PCs by enriching the hydrophobic polymer domain and altering the BCP packing parameter. After self&#8208;assemby, highly porous and fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs are obtained.
Fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs show high antimycotic activity against Botrytis cinerea (grey mold), adhere to Vitis vinifera Riesling leaves even after simulated rain, and release the fungicide continuously over several days with different release&#8208;kinetics compared to solid particles. PCs hydrolyze completely into lactic acid and phosphate derivatives, highlighting their potential as microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery systems for sustainable agriculture.

A straightforward self-assembly method is demonstrated for fully degradable porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), showcasing their ability to load and release agrochemicals. Using fully degradable block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-polylactide (PEEP-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLA), PCs are synthesized in water with high inner order and open pores averaging 19 &#177; 3 nm in diameter. During the self-assembly process in the presence of the hydrophobic fungicide tebuconazole, polymersomes transform into PCs by enriching the hydrophobic polymer domain and altering the BCP packing parameter. After self-assemby, highly porous and fungicide-loaded PCs are obtained.
Fungicide-loaded PCs show high antimycotic activity against &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt; (grey mold), adhere to &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; Riesling leaves even after simulated rain, and release the fungicide continuously over several days with different release-kinetics compared to solid particles. PCs hydrolyze completely into lactic acid and phosphate derivatives, highlighting their potential as microplastic-free agrochemical delivery systems for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;Memory in van der Waals Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;memory has been found&#160;in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2. The migration of Br ions induces a reversible modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in significant anisotropy and electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photovoltaic currents. Consequently, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is implemented. It&#160;opens up new possibilities for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The photovoltaic effect is gaining growing attention in the optoelectronics field due to its low power consumption, sustainable nature, and high efficiency. However, the photovoltaic effects hitherto reported are hindered by the stringent band&#8208;alignment requirement or inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking, and are challenging for achieving multifunctional photovoltaic properties (such as reconfiguration, nonvolatility, and so on). Here, a novel ionic photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2 that can overcome these limitations is demonstrated. The photovoltaic effect displays significant anisotropy, with the photocurrent being most apparent along the CdBr2 chains while absent perpendicular to them. Additionally, the device shows electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photocurrent switching characteristics. The photovoltaic effect is attributed to the modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field through the migration of Br ions. Using these unique photovoltaic properties, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is successfully implemented. The findings not only broaden the understanding of the photovoltaic mechanism, but also provide a new material platform for the development of in&#8208;memory sensing and computing devices.

         <title>In Situ Multi&#8208;Directional Liquid Manipulation Enabled by 3D Asymmetric Fang&#8208;Structured Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carefully designed fang&#8208;structured surface generates a unique distributed 3D multi&#8208;curvature, yielding a response to liquid surface tension for customized control of multi&#8208;directional liquid spreading. This enables innovative functions beyond conventional surfaces, including constructing selective multi&#8208;path circuits, portably indicating surface tensions of wetting liquids with a resolution of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1, and temperature&#8208;mediated smart manipulation of liquids.








Abstract
Decorating surfaces with wetting gradients or topological structures is a prevailing strategy to control uni&#8208;directional spreading without energy input. However, current methods, limited by fixed design, cannot achieve multi&#8208;directional control of liquids, posing challenges to practical applications. Here, a structured surface composed of arrayed three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric fang&#8208;structured units is reported that enable in situ control of customized multi&#8208;directional spreading for different surface tension liquids, exhibiting five novel modes. This is attributed to bottom&#8208;up distributed multi&#8208;curvature features of surface units, which create varied Laplace pressure gradients to guide the spreading of different&#8208;wettability liquids along specific directions. The surface's capability to respond to liquid properties for multimodal control leads to innovative functions that are absent in conventional structured surfaces. Selective multi&#8208;path circuits can be constructed by taking advantage of rich liquid behaviors with the surface; surface tensions of wetting liquids can be portably indicated with a resolution scope of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1 using the surface; temperature&#8208;mediated change of liquid properties is utilized to smartly manipulate liquid behavior and achieve the spatiotemporal&#8208;controllable targeted cooling of the surface at its heated state. These novel applications open new avenues for developing advanced surfaces for liquid manipulation.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Bioinspired Lignin Adhesive for Wearable Bioelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demethylation combined with intramolecular amino acid synergy endows biomass lignin with mussel&#8208;like, strong, reversible, and biocompatible adhesion. Excellent adhesion is confirmed at the molecular level, analyzed using molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations, and tested in organohydrogel&#8208;based wearable bioelectronics at low dosages.








Abstract
As a natural &#8220;binder,&#8221; lignin fixes cellulose in plants to foster growth and longevity. However, isolated lignin has a poor binding ability, which limits its biomedical applications. In this study, inspired by mussel adhesive proteins, acidic/basic amino acids (AAs) are introduced in alkali lignin (AL) to form ionic&#8208;&#960;/spatial correlation interactions, followed by demethylation to create catechol residues for enhanced adhesion activity. Atomic force microscopy reveals that catechol residues are the primary adhesion structures, with basic AAs exhibiting superior synergistic effects compared to acidic AAs. Demethylated lysine&#8208;grafted AL exhibits the strongest adhesion force toward skin tissue. Molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculations indicate that adhesion against skin tissue mainly results from hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, with the adhesion mechanism being based on the Gibbs free energy of the Schiff base reaction. In summary, a biomimetic electrode based on lignin inspired by mussel adhesive proteins is prepared; the presented method offers a straightforward strategy for the development of biomimetic adhesives. Furthermore, this mussel&#8208;inspired adhesive can be used as a wearable bioelectrode in biomedical applications.

         <title>The Guardian of Vision: Intelligent Bacteriophage&#8208;Based Eyedrops for Clinical Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Ocular Surface Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel intelligent phage eyedrop for treating refractory bacterial keratitis caused by clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining a type I photosensitizer ACR&#8208;DMT with a phage is developed. This eyedrop maximizes the advantages of phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy to effectively target and kill multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria in the eye, preventing biofilm formation and promoting healing without scarring, and acts as a robust guardian of vision. 








Abstract
Clinical multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR&#8208;PA) is the leading cause of refractory bacterial keratitis (BK). However, the reported BK treatment methods lack biosecurity and bioavailability, which usually causes irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. Herein, for BK caused by clinically isolated MDR&#8208;PA infection, armed phages are modularized with the type I photosensitizer (PS) ACR&#8208;DMT, and an intelligent phage eyedrop is developed for combined phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These eyedrops maximize the advantages of bacteriophages and ACR&#8208;DMT, enabling more robust and specific targeting killing of MDR&#8208;PA under low oxygen&#8208;dependence, penetrating and disrupting biofilms, and efficiently preventing biofilm reformation. Altering the biofilm and immune microenvironments alleviates inflammation noninvasively, promotes corneal healing without scar formation, protects ocular tissues, restores visual function, and prevents long&#8208;term discomfort and pain. This strategy exhibits strong scalability, enables at&#8208;home treatment of ocular surface infections with great patient compliance and a favorable prognosis, and has significant potential for clinical application.

         <title>High&#8208;Detectivity All&#8208;Polymer Photodiode Empowers Smart Vitality Surveillance and Computational Imaging Rivaling Silicon Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;polymer organic photodiode with broadband competence is introduced with a newly designed acceptor material. The significantly&#160;improved OPD figures of merit with the polymer third component is investigated, focusing on exciton dynamics, morphology evolution, and trap characteristics. The OPD demonstrates competitive performance in machine learning&#8208;based blood pressure (BP) estimation and single&#8208;pixel imaging (SPI) in complex imaging environments, rivaling commercial silicon diodes.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs), particularly all&#8208;polymer&#8208;based ones, hold substantial commercial promise in the healthcare and imaging sectors. However, the process of optimizing their active layer composition to achieve highly competitive figures of merit lacks a clear direction and methodology. In this work, celebrity polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT into a more NIR absorbing host system PBDB&#8208;T:PZF&#8208;V, to significantly enhance the photodetection competence, is introduced. The refined all&#8208;polymer ternary broadband photodetector demonstrates superior performance metrics, including experimentally measured noise current as low as 6 fA Hz&#8722;1/2, specific detectivity reaching 8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones, linear dynamic range (LDR) of 145 dB, and swift response speed surpassing 200 kHz, striking a fair balance between sensitivity and response speed. Comprehensive morphological and photophysical characterizations elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed performance enhancements in this study, which include reduced trap density, enhanced charge transport, diminished charge recombination, and balanced electron/hole mobilities. Moreover, the practical deployment potential of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device in self&#8208;powered mode is demonstrated through their application in a machine learning&#8208;based cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation system and in high&#8208;resolution computational imaging across complex environments, where they are found to quantitatively rival commercial silicon diodes.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron&#8208;Transfer Via Hybrid States at Perovskite/Fullerene Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer of &#8776;100&#160;fs is observed between perovskite and fullerene. The timescale is comparable with hot&#8208;electron cooling inside perovskite, leading to efficient electron&#8208;transfer overcoming an unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignment. The process is achieved with the assistance of interfacial hybrid states, which originate from strong electronic coupling. This finding provides new guidelines for advanced device design.








Abstract
Interfacial charge&#8208;transfer between perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers plays a key role in determining performance of perovskite solar cells. The conventional viewpoint emphases the necessity of favorable energy&#8208;level alignment of the two components. In recent reports, efficient electron&#8208;transfer is observed from perovskite to fullerene&#8208;based electron&#8208;transport layers even when there are unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, using an ultrafast in situ two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, real&#8208;time observations of electron&#8208;transfer processes at CsPbI3/C60 interface in both temporal and energetic dimensions are reported. Due to strong electronic coupling, a large amount of interfacial hybrid states is generated at the interfaces, aiding fast photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer in &#8776;124&#160;fs. This process is further verified by nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations and transient absorption experiments. The short timescale explains why electron&#8208;transfer can overcome unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, providing a guideline for device design.

         <title>Stabilizing Interlayer Repulsion in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Oxide Cathodes via Hierarchical Layer Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical layer modification strategy stabilizes interlayer repulsion and suppresses phase transformation in sodium&#8208;ion layered cathodes, achieving a single structure across a wide voltage by maintaining cationic content with migrated Li+ and anchored Ca2+, increasing oxygen layer valence with F&#8722; substitution and O redox reactions, and leveraging the interplay between robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects.








Abstract
Layered sodium&#8208;ion oxides hold considerable promise in achieving high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious phase transformation during charging, attributed to increased O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion, results in substantial performance decay. Here, a hierarchical layer modification strategy is proposed to stabilize interlayer repulsion. During desodiation, migrated Li+ from the transition metal layer and anchored Ca2+ in sodium sites maintain the cationic content within the sodium layer. Meanwhile, partial oxygen substitution by fluorine and the involvement of oxygen in redox reactions increase the average valence of the oxygen layer. This sustained cation presence and elevated anion valence collectively mitigate increasing O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion during sodium extraction, enabling the Na0.61Ca0.05[Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67]O1.95F0.05 (NCLNMOF) cathode to retain a pure P2&#8208;type structure across a wide voltage range. Unexpected insights reveal the interplay between different doping elements: the robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects suppressing Li+ loss. The NCLNMOF electrode exhibits 82.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and a high&#8208;rate capability of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1600&#160;mA g&#8722;1, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical layer modification for high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Electric Double&#8208;Layer in Sulfur Catalysis for Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) to describe the sulfur adsorption in the electric double layer on the metal catalyst surface. An alloying method to alter it by enhancing p&#8211;d hybridization with electrolyte solvents is proposed, and a cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur shows enhanced activity and anti&#8208;passivation ability simultaneously in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfur reaction in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries usually suffers from the strong binding of sulfur species to the catalyst surface, which destroys the electric double layer (EDL) region there. This causes rapid catalyst deactivation because it prevents the desorption of sulfur species and mass transport through the EDL is hindered. This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) as a new indicator to quantify the competitive adsorption of sulfur species in the EDL and proposes an alloying method to change it by strengthening the p&#8211;d hybridization of alloying metals with electrolyte solvents. A cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur lowers the activation energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step of the conversion of lithium polysulfides to lithium sulfide, giving a platform capacity proportion that is 96% of the theoretical value and has a greatly improved anti&#8208;passivation ability, especially at high sulfur loadings and lean electrolyte conditions (a low E/S ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1). A pouch cell using this approach has a high energy density of up to 464&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Such a competitive adsorption indicator and alloying strategy offer a new guideline for catalyst design and a practical electrocatalysis solution for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Soft&#8208;Fiber Bioelectronic Device with Axon&#8208;Like Architecture Enables Reliable Neural Recording In Vivo under Vigorous Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft fiber neural device resembling an axon skeleton with a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure is constructed, having an ideal combination of stretchability, low modulus, low specific impedance, and high electrical conductivity. This fiber neural device can solve the longstanding problem of recording neurons in vivo under vigorous activities even in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals.








Abstract
Implantable neural devices that record neurons in various states, including static states, light activities such as walking, and vigorous activities such as running, offer opportunities for understanding brain functions and dysfunctions. However, recording neurons under vigorous activities remains a long&#8208;standing challenge because it leads to intense brain deformation. Thus, three key requirements are needed simultaneously for neural devices, that is, low modulus, low specific interfacial impedance, and high electrical conductivity, to realize stable device/brain interfaces and high&#8208;quality transmission of neural signals. However, they always contradict each other in current material strategies. Here, a soft fiber neural device capable of stably tracking individual neurons in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals under vigorous activity is reported. Inspired by the axon architecture, this fiber neural device is constructed with a conductive gel fiber possessing a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure using conjugated polymers and liquid matrices and then insulated with soft fluorine rubber. This strategy reconciles the contradictions and simultaneously confers the fiber neural device with low modulus (300&#160;kPa), low specific impedance (579&#160;k&#937;&#160;&#181;m2), and high electrical conductivity (32&#160;700&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) &#8211; &#8776;1&#8211;3 times higher than hydrogels. Stable single&#8208;unit spike tracking in running cats, which promises new opportunities for neuroscience is demonstrated.

         <title>Achieving Ultrasound&#8208;Excited Emission with Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence with emission wavelengths extending into the near&#8208;infrared region are achieved using organic mechanoluminescent materials exhibiting high photoluminescence quantum yields, persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, and adjustable aggregated structures in the crystalline state. Accordingly, US&#8208;excited in vivo phosphorescence imaging of living mice is performed using a mechanoluminescence&#8208;based capsule device.








Abstract
Unlike traditional photoluminescence (PL), mechanoluminescence (ML) achieved under mechanical excitation demonstrates unique characteristics such as high penetrability, spatial resolution, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) for bioimaging applications. However, bioimaging with organic mechanoluminescent materials remains challenging because of the shallow penetration depth of ML with short emission wavelengths and the absence of a suitable mechanical force to generate ML in vivo. To resolve these issues, the present paper reports the achievement of ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence from purely organic luminogens for the first time with emission wavelengths extending to the red/NIR region, with the penetrability of the US&#8208;excited emission being considerably higher than that of PL. Consequently, US&#8208;excited subcutaneous phosphorescence imaging can be achieved using a mechanoluminescent&#8208;luminogen&#8208;based capsule device with a quantified intensity of 9.15 &#177; 1.32 &#215; 104 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1 and an SBR of 24. Moreover, the US&#8208;excited emission can be adequately tuned using the packing modes of the conjugated skeletons, dipole orientation of mechanoluminescent luminogens, and strength and direction of intermolecular interactions. Overall, this study innovatively expands the kind of excitation sources and the emission wavelengths of organic mechanoluminescent materials, paving the way for practical biological applications based on US&#8208;excited emission.

         <title>Constructing Co4(SO4)4 Clusters within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear metal clusters are widely used in nature for catalyzing small molecule activation reactions, which involve the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, a series of Co4(SO4)4&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their electrocatalytic properties for oxygen electrocatalysis are reported. The Co4(SO4)4 cluster has an unparalleled structure among previously reported Co&#8208;based clusters.








Abstract
Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co4(SO4)4 cluster within porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co4(SO4)4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of CoII sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs (M&#9552;Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co4(SO4)4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co&#9472;Npyridyl bonds. In the Co4(SO4)4 cluster, the four CoII ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube&#8208;like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co4(SO4)4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co4&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 357&#160;mV overpotential and an ORR half&#8208;wave potential at 0.83&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co4(SO4)4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O&#9472;O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co4(SO4)4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O&#9472;O bond formation process.

         <title>Photocontrolled Reversible Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions of Azopolymer Nanocomposites for Intelligent Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanocomposites with photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions are designed and used for the construction of intelligent nanomaterials. Photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions enable the solvent&#8208;free processing and reconfiguration of nanocomposites at room temperature, which represent an innovative strategy for the development of intelligent materials with responsive, rewritable, error&#8208;correctable, and dynamic properties.








Abstract
Intelligent polymer nanocomposites are multicomponent and multifunctional materials that show immense potential across diverse applications. However, to exhibit intelligent traits such as adaptability, reconfigurability and dynamic properties, these materials often require a solvent or heating environment to facilitate the mobility of polymer chains and nanoparticles, rendering their applications in everyday settings impractical. Here intelligent azopolymer nanocomposites that function effectively in a solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature environment based on photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions via switching flow temperatures (Tfs) are shown. A range of nanocomposites is synthesized through the grafting of Au nanoparticles, Au nanorods, quantum dots, or superparamagnetic nanoparticles with photoresponsive azopolymers. Leveraging the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of azo groups, the azopolymer nanocomposites transition between solid (Tf above room temperature) and fluid (Tf below room temperature) states. Such photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions empower the rewriting of nanopatterns, correction of nanoscale defects, reconfiguration of complex multiscale structures, and design of intelligent optical devices. These findings highlight Tf&#8208;switchable polymer nanocomposites as promising candidates for the development of intelligent nanomaterials operative in solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Site Nucleation Growth of Twisted Bilayer MoS2 with Commensurate Angles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method, the gas&#8208;flow perturbation CVD approach to directly synthesis bilayer MoS2 homostructures with a clean interface and versatile twist angles ranging from 8&#176; to 56&#176; is developed. Enhanced moir&#233; excitons in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176; are evidenced by using the low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and density function theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, composed of two layers of transition metal dichalcogenides with a relative twist angle, provide a novel platform for exploring the correlated electronic phases and excitonic physics. Here, a gas&#8208;flow perturbation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach is demonstrated to directly grow MoS2 bilayer with versatile twist angles. It is found that the formation of twisted bilayer MoS2 homostructures sensitively depends on the gas&#8208;flow perturbation modes, correspondingly featuring the nucleation sites of the second layer at the same (homo&#8208;site) as or at the different (hetero&#8208;site) from that of the first layer. The commensurate twist angle of &#8776;22&#176; in homo&#8208;site nucleation strategy accounts for &#8776;16% among the broad range of twist angles due to its low formation energy, which is in consistence with the theoretical calculation. More importantly, moir&#233; interlayer excitons with the enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity and the prolonged lifetime are evidenced in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176;, which is owing to the reason that the strong moir&#233; potential facilitates the interlayer excitons to be trapped in the moir&#233; superlattices. The work provides a feasible route to controllably built twisted MoS2 homostructures with strong moir&#233; potential to investigate the correlated physics in twistronics systems.

         <title>Trace Small Molecular/Nano&#8208;Colloidal Multiscale Electrolyte Additives Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan of Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives, zinc acetylacetonate, enable ultra&#8208;long lifespan of zinc metal anodes (e.g., a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2). The slightly water&#8208;soluble additives exist not only as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, but also as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in situ form a robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc anodes.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are efficient to improve the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet the current electrolyte additives are limited to fully water&#8208;soluble additives (FWAs) and water&#8208;insoluble additives (WIAs). Herein, trace slightly water&#8208;soluble additives (SWAs) of zinc acetylacetonate (ZAA) were introduced to aqueous ZnSO4 electrolytes. The SWA system of ZAA is composed of a FWA part and a WIA part in a dynamic manner of dissolution equilibrium. The FWA part exists as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, while the WIA part exists as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in&#8208;situ form a thick and robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc metal anodes (ZMAs). Such small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives of ZAA are capable to not only improve ionic conductivity and transference number but also inhibit corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and Zn dendrite on ZMAs. The SWA&#8208;based Zn&#8741;Zn half battery delivers a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2 under 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 20 mA cm&#8722;2, and the SWA&#8208;based NH4V4O10&#8741;Zn pouch cell obtains a capacity retention of 67.8% within 4000 cycles under 4 A g&#8722;1. The study provides innovative insights for rational design of electrolyte additives, which may pave the way for the practicality of AZIBs.

         <title>Infectious and Inflammatory Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Peroxisomes with Synergetic Co&#8208;Ru Pair Centers for Programmed Diabetic Ulcer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infectious and inflammatory microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisome with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) has been designed for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. The synthesized APCR presents pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation activities, thus achieving the programmed bifunctional performances for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment and also alleviation of oxidative stress to promote wound tissue regeneration in the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Complex microenvironments with bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis are the major challenges in chronic refractory diabetic ulcers. To address this challenge, a comprehensive strategy with highly effective and integrated antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerated angiogenesis will offer a new pathway to the rapid healing of infected diabetic ulcers. Here, inspired by the tunable reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation properties of natural peroxisomes, this work reports the design of infectious and inflammatory microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisomes with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. Benefiting from the synergistic Co and Ru atoms, the APCR can simultaneously achieve ROS production and metabolic inhibition for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment. After disinfection, the APCR can also eliminate ROS to alleviate oxidative stress in the inflammatory microenvironment and promote wound regeneration. The data demonstrate that the APCR combines highly effective antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and provascular regeneration capabilities, making it an efficient and safe nanomedicine for treating infectious and inflammatory diabetic foot ulcers via a programmed microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive treatment pathway. This work expects that synthesizing artificial peroxisomes with microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive and bifunctional enzyme&#8208;like ROS regulation properties will provide a promising path to construct ROS catalytic materials for treating complex diabetic ulcers, trauma, or other infection&#8208;caused diseases.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The configuration of the Helmholtz absorption plane plays an important role in manipulating the structure, composition, distribution, and properties of the derived cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the layered&#8208;oxide cathode. By rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane, an anion&#8208;tuned stable CEI can be dynamically constructed to resist attack from high&#8208;oxidation states, thus facilitating long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and solid electrolyte interphase reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component CEI proves effective for the long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves a 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Multidirectional Bending in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast light&#8208;triggered multidirectional bending is demonstrated in soft twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles. The bending direction is dictated by the direction of the light leading to localized untwisting of the muscle. These artificial muscles can autonomously turn toward a light source, and they can be programmed for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in textiles.








Abstract
Using light to drive polymer actuators can enable spatially selective complex motions, offering a wealth of opportunities for wireless control of soft robotics and active textiles. Here, the integration of photothermal components is reported into shape memory polymer actuators. The fabricated twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles show on&#8208;command multidirectional bending, which can be controlled by both the illumination intensity, as well as the chirality, of the prepared artificial muscles. Importantly, the direction in which these artificial muscles bend does not depend on intrinsic material characteristics. Instead, this directionality is achieved by localized untwisting of the actuator, driven by selective irradiation. The reaction times of this bending system are significantly &#8211; at least two orders of magnitude &#8211; faster than heliotropic biological systems, with a response time up to one second. The programmability of the artificial muscles is further demonstrated for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in butterfly&#8208;shaped textiles, along with the capacity to autonomously orient toward a light source. This functionality is maintained even on a rotating platform, with angular velocities of 6&#176;/s, independent of the rotation direction. These attributes collectively represent a breakthrough in the field of artificial muscles, intended to adaptive shape&#8208;changing soft systems and biomimetic technologies.

         <title>Revealing Mode Formation in Quasi&#8208;Bound States in the Continuum Metasurfaces via Near&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;field microscopy technique is introduced that resolves and quantifies quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum modes in dielectric metasurfaces. The technique is employed for analyzing metasurface properties such as the finite array size effect, directional coupling, edge effects and defects on the single resonator level promising advancements in metasurface based catalysis and biospectroscopy by optimizing spatial footprint and active area.








Abstract
Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high&#8208;quality factors and strong near&#8208;field enhancement. Here, the mode formation in quasi&#8208;BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique, is quantitatively investigated. It is found that the quasi&#8208;BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8208;unit cells much smaller than expected from far&#8208;field measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi&#8208;BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels Facilitates Strong and Large Contractile Actuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent interacts affinitively with the NIPAAm monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and significantly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels can generate the actuation force through volumetric transitions in response to temperature changes. However, their weak mechanical properties and fragile actuation performance limit robust applications. Existing approaches to enhance these properties have typically depended on additional components, leading to an unavoidable interference to the actuation performance. In this work, robust thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent, N&#8208;methylformamide, interacts affinitively with the carbonyl group of N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and greatly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting polymer. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation. The simple synthetic process can broaden its applicability in designing robust functional hydrogel applications.

All&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic nanoparticles are fabricated for long&#8208;acting enhanced PDT and PTT against tuberculosis. Those erythrocyte membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanoparticles simultaneously functionalized by granuloma&#8208;targeting, NIR&#8208;II emission, efficient ROS production, self&#8208;oxygenation, and good photothermal conversion characteristics, both facilitated delivery efficiency and extraordinary theranostic capability in the form of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided combined phototherapy toward mouse tuberculous granuloma model.








Abstract
Tuberculosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is difficult to treat with antibiotics due to drug resistance and short drug half&#8208;life. Phototherapy represents a promising alternative to antibiotics in combating M.tb. Exploring an intelligent material allowing effective tuberculosis treatment is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle featured by aggregation&#8208;induced second near&#8208;infrared emission, granuloma&#8208;targeting, and self&#8208;oxygenation is constructed, which can serve for prominent fluorescence imaging&#8208;navigated combined phototherapy toward tuberculosis. After camouflaging the biomimetic erythrocyte membrane, the nanoparticles show significantly prolonged blood circulation and increased selective accumulation in tuberculosis granuloma. Upon laser irradiation, the loading photosensitizer of aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer elevates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing M.tb damage and death. The delivery of oxygen to relieve the hypoxic granuloma microenvironment supports ROS generation during photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the photothermal agent, Prussian blue nanoparticles, plays the role of good photothermal killing effect on M.tb. Moreover, the growth and proliferation of granuloma and M.tb colonies are effectively inhibited in the nanoparticle&#8208;treated tuberculous granuloma model mice, suggesting the combined therapeutic effects of enhancing photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Broadband Sunlight&#8208;Like Emission in Single&#8208;Phase Phosphors: The Interplay of Structure and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research work develops ultra&#8208;broadband sunlight&#8208;like emission Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphors with a 330 nm full width at half maximum using a heterovalent substitution strategy. The phosphors&#8217; unique luminescence makes the resulting white LEDs ideal for portable photodetection devices. Its high effectiveness is demonstrated by the precise identification of dye patterns via broad&#8208;spectrum testing of organic dyes, making it a top choice for mimicking sunlight.








Abstract
The quest for artificial light sources mimicking sunlight has been a long&#8208;standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators are often cost&#8208;prohibitive and bulky. Therefore, the development of a series of single&#8208;phase phosphors Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:0.1Eu2+ (x = 0&#8208;0.75) with sunlight&#8208;like emission represents a welcome step towards compact and economical light source alternatives. The phosphors are obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum &#160; spanning from violet to deep red.

&lt;p&gt;This research work develops ultra-broadband sunlight-like emission Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;LiMg&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2x/3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphors with a 330 nm full width at half maximum using a heterovalent substitution strategy. The phosphors&#8217; unique luminescence makes the resulting white LEDs ideal for portable photodetection devices. Its high effectiveness is demonstrated by the precise identification of dye patterns via broad-spectrum testing of organic dyes, making it a top choice for mimicking sunlight.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest for artificial light sources mimicking sunlight has been a long-standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators are often cost-prohibitive and bulky. Therefore, the development of a series of single-phase phosphors Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;LiMg&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2x/3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:0.1Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (x = 0-0.75) with sunlight-like emission represents a welcome step towards compact and economical light source alternatives. The phosphors are obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum &#160; spanning from violet to deep red. Notably, the phosphor with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5 exhibits an impressive full width at half-maximum of 330&#160;nm. A synergistic interplay of experimental investigations and theory unveils the mechanism behind sunlight-like emission due to the local structural perturbations introduced by the heterovalent substitution of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a varied distribution of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the lattice. Subsequent characterization of a series of organic dyes combining absorption spectroscopy with convolutional neural network analysis convincingly demonstrates the potential of this phosphor in portable photodetection devices. Broad-spectrum light source testing empowers the model to precisely differentiate dye patterns. This points to the phosphor being ideal for mimicking sunlight. Beyond this demonstrated application, the phosphor's utility is envisioned in other relevant domains, including visible light communication and smart agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Lignin Polymers for Controlled CO2 Capture, Release, and Conversion into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic biomass lignin polymer is synthesized for capturing CO2 from direct&#8208;air and concentrated&#8208;CO2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The captured&#8208;CO2 is released in a controlled manner and utilized in the organic synthesis, demonstrating the productive application of the captured carbon. The CO2 capture &#8596; CO2 release cycles can be repeated continuously.








Abstract
In this study, an innovative and cost&#8208;effective ionic polymer for CO2 capture and utilization for the first time, using abundant and nonfood&#8208;based biomass lignin is reported. The modified ionic polymer synthesizes through the reaction of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride with lignin under alkaline conditions to yield quaternary ammonium ionic functionality. Subsequently, the hydroxide&#8208;based pure ionic lignin polymer is employed for CO2 capture from both direct air and concentrated CO2 sources at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Structural characterization of the polymers is accomplished through 1H, 13C, and 2D&#8208;heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC)&#160;NMR, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The CO2 capture process is established through the formation of bicarbonate ions alongside the presence of CO2. The captured CO2 is precisely quantified by using inverse&#8208;gated proton decoupled 13C NMR with an internal standard (trioxane). Remarkably, the captured&#8208;CO2 amounts of ionic lignin polymer are 1.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 (47&#160;mg g&#8722;1) from concentrated&#8208;CO2 source and 0.60&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 (26&#160;mg g&#8722;1) from direct&#8208;air. The captured&#8208;CO2 in ionic lignin polymer is released in controlled manner and utilized in the synthesis of cyclic carbonate, showcasing the productive application of the captured carbon. Moreover, the fully controlled recovering of ionic lignin polymer achieves via repeated CO2 release &#8596; CO2 capture.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Intermetallic Heterostructure on Hierarchical Nanoporous Metal for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on nanoporous Ni skeleton exhibits exceptional activities and durability for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. Such dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure enables interfacial atoms to configure multisites to accelerate water dissociation/combination, demonstrating the feasibility to construct well&#8208;defined active multisites for multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions based on intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
Constructing well&#8208;defined active multisites is an effective strategy to break linear scaling relationships to develop high&#8208;efficiency catalysts toward multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions. Here, dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nanoporous nickel skeleton is reported as a high&#8208;performance nonprecious electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. By virtue of interfacial tungsten atoms configuring contiguous multisites with proper adsorptions of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates to accelerate water dissociation/combination and column&#8208;nanostructured nickel skeleton facilitating electron and ion/molecule transportations, nanoporous nickel&#8208;supported Co3W&#8211;WNi4 heterostructure exhibits exceptional hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, with outstanding durability and impressive catalytic activities for hydrogen oxidation reaction (geometric exchange current density of &#8776;6.62 mA cm&#8722;2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (current density of &#8776;1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at overpotential of 200 mV). Such atom&#8208;ordered intermetallic heterostructure alternative to platinum group metals shows genuine potential for hydrogen production and utilization in hydroxide&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers and fuel cells.

         <title>Large Orientation Angle Buried Substrate Enables Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (A&#8208;4PADCB) is designed and synthesized, demonstrating favorable coverage on ITO and optimized interface contact with perovskite. When applied A&#8208;4PADCB as buried substrate, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.05% for flexible perovskite solar cells and 20.64% (certified 19.51%) for flexible perovskite solar modules are obtained, which are the highest PCEs in the reported literature.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as potential candidates for specific mechanical applications owing to their high foldability, efficiency, and portability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;PSC remains limited by the inferior contact between perovskite and flexible buried substrate. Here, an asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) (4&#8208;(9H&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (A&#8208;4PADCB) is reported as a buried substrate for efficient inverted f&#8208;PSCs. Employing this design strategy, A&#8208;4PADCB exhibits a significant orientation angle away from the surface normal, homogenizing the distribution of contact potentials. This enhancement improves the SAM/perovskite interface quality, controlling the growth of favorable perovskite films with low defect density and slight tensile stress. Integration of A&#8208;4PADCB into small&#8208;area f&#8208;PSCs and large&#8208;area flexible perovskite solar modules with an aperture area of 20.84&#160;cm2 achieves impressive PCEs of up to 25.05% and 20.64% (certified 19.51%), respectively. Moreover, these optimized A&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;based f&#8208;PSCs possess enhanced light, thermal, and mechanical stability. This research paves a promising avenue toward the design of SAM&#8208;buried substrates with a large orientation angle, regulating perovskite growth, and promoting the commercialization of large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photovoltaics.

A P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and analyze the influence of coordination structure on electrochemical performance. The well&#8208;designed CoSA&#8208;N3PS structure can promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby accelerating the bi&#8208;directional redox process of sulfur and exhibiting satisfactory electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been increasingly explored in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries to address the issues of severe polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between single&#8208;atom coordination structures and the performance of Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries remain unclear. In this study, a P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby limiting polysulfides and accelerating the bidirectional redox process of sulfur. The well&#8208;designed SACs enable Li&#8211;S batteries to demonstrate an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. Furthermore, they display excellent rate performance with a capacity of 619 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C due to the efficient catalysis of CoSA&#8208;N3PS. Importantly, the assembled pouch cell still retains a high discharge capacity of 660 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and provides a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that regulating the coordination environment of SACs is of great significance for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Mullite Mineral&#8208;Derived Robust Solid Electrolyte Enables Polyiodide Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mullite is transformed as high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) to address the issues of zinc dendrites, iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle for Zn//AC@I2 batteries. For the Zn anode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte eliminates the side reactions and guides the uniform zinc deposition behavior. For the AC@I2 cathode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte minimizes the active iodine dissolution and inhibits the polyiodide shuttle, endowing long&#8208;term cyclic stability.








Abstract
Zinc dendrite, active iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle caused by the strong interaction between liquid electrolyte and solid electrode are the chief culprits for the capacity attenuation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs). Herein, mullite is adopted as raw material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) for ZIBs through zinc ion exchange strategy. Owing to the merits of low electronic conductivity, low zinc diffusion energy barrier, and strong polyiodide adsorption capability, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte can effectively isolate the redox reactions of zinc anode and AC@I2 cathode, guide the reversible zinc deposition behavior, and inhibit the active iodine dissolution as well as polyiodide shuttle during cycling process. As expected, wide operating voltage window of 2.7&#160;V (vs Zn2+/Zn), high Zn2+ transference number of 0.51, and low activation energy barrier of 29.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 can be achieved for the solid&#8208;state Zn//Zn cells. Meanwhile, high reversible capacity of 127.4 and 107.6 mAh g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.5 and 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3&#160;000 and 2&#160;100 cycles for the solid&#8208;state Zn//AC@I2 batteries, corresponding to high&#8208;capacity retention ratio of 85.2% and 80.7%, respectively. This study will inspire the development of mineral&#8208;derived solid electrolyte, and facilitate its application in Zn&#8208;based secondary batteries.

         <title>Confining Iodine into Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of several Zn&#8208;MOFs is adopted for obtaining porous carbon materials. Moreover, iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon materials, featuring atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, are further prepared and utilized as efficient cathode hosts for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The wearable microbattery application offers insights for future developments in long&#8208;lasting aqueous battery designs.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are highly appealing for energy requirements owing to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability. However, the inadequate redox kinetics and severe shuttling effect of polyiodide ions impede their commercial viability. Herein, several Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived porous carbon materials are designed, and the further preparation of iron&#8211;doped porous carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, M9) with varied Fe doping contents is optimized based on a facile self&#8208;assembly/carbonization approach. M9, with atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, is employed as an efficient cathode host for AZIBs. Functional modifications of porous carbon hosts involving the doping species and levels are investigated. The adsorption tests, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ UV&#8211;vis results demonstrate the adsorption capability and charge&#8208;discharge mechanism for the iodine species. Furthermore, experimental findings and theoretical analyses have proven that the redox conversion of iodine is enhanced through a physicochemical confinement effect. This study offers basic principles for the strategic design of single&#8208;atom dispersed carbon as an iodine host for high&#8208;performance AZIBs. Flexible soft&#8211;pack battery and wearable microbattery applications also have implications for future long&#8208;life aqueous battery designs.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis
The work by Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung and co&#8208;workers conveys a crucial message: angstrom&#8208;level atomic displacement on the surface, followed by catalytic degradation, appears to commonly occur in many catalysts, even though no substantial elemental dissolution takes place. Moreover, even catalysts known to be stable can undergo significant oxidation of lattice oxygen under high overpotentials. More details can be found in article number 2403392.

Moreover, even catalysts known to be stable can undergo significant oxidation of lattice oxygen under high overpotentials. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202403392"&gt;2403392&lt;/a&gt;.

Cancer Immunotherapy
Man Kyu Shim, Yongju Kim, Yoosoo Yang, and colleagues develope a light&#8208;triggered proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) nanoassembly. This nanoassembly accumulates significantly in tumor tissues, triggering a burst release of active PROTACs. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death to promote T cell activation, while the recyclable action of the PROTACs simultaneously blocks regulatory T cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. More details can be found in article number 2405475.

Mimicking Sunlight
An unprecedented ultra&#8208;broadband full&#8208;spectrum emission phosphor is designed by local structural modulation with Al3+ heterovalent substitution of Mg2+. The phosphor emits an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum covering the entire visible range, closely matching the sun's emission. This phosphor is ideal for simulating sunlight and is promising for applications in color hue detection, visible light communication, and smart agriculture. More details can be found in article number 2406164 by Jean&#8208;Claude G. B&#252;nzli, Lei Zhou, Mingmei Wu, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity Transistors for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant progress has been made in visuomorphic computing, but challenges remain in perceiving complex interactive environments. This review is the first to discuss the development and application of NPTs in the field of visuomorphic computing and provides a good reference for others to design lower power consumption, multivisual task coordinated, and multisensory fused artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Visuomorphic computing aims to simulate and potentially surpass the human retina by mimicking biological visual perception with an artificial retina. Despite significant progress, challenges persist in perceiving complex interactive environments. Negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs) mimic synaptic behavior by achieving adjustable positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC), simulating &#8220;excitation&#8221; and &#8220;inhibition&#8221; akin to sensory cell signals. In complex interactive environments, NPTs are desired for visuomorphic computing that can achieve a better sense of information, lower power consumption, and reduce hardware complexity. In this review, it is started by introducing the development process of NPTs, while placing a strong emphasis on the device structures, working mechanisms, and key performance parameters. The common material systems employed in NPTs based on their functions are then summarized. Moreover, it is proceeded to summarize the noteworthy applications of NPTs in optoelectronic devices, including advanced multibit nonvolatile memory, optoelectronic logic gates, optical encryption, and visual perception. Finally, the challenges and prospects that lie ahead in the ongoing development of NPTs are addressed, offering valuable insights into their applications in optoelectronics and a comprehensive understanding of their significance.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Artificial Synapses for Sustainable Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors and their potential as artificial synapses are discussed. In doing so, an outlook on new biocompatible and sustainable neuromorphic hardware is provided and how potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels find widespread applications in biomedicine because of their outstanding biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable material properties. Hydrogels can be chemically functionalized or reinforced to respond to physical or chemical stimulation, which opens up new possibilities in the emerging field of intelligent bioelectronics. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors is reviewed as potential artificial synapses. Within these systems, hydrogels can serve as semisolid dielectric electrolytes in transistors and as switching layers in memristors. These synaptic devices with volatile and non&#8208;volatile resistive switching show good adaptability to external stimuli for short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic memory effects, some of which are integrated into synaptic arrays as artificial neurons; although, there are discrepancies in switching performance and efficacy. By comparing different hydrogels and their respective properties, an outlook is provided on a new range of biocompatible, environment&#8208;friendly, and sustainable neuromorphic hardware. How potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is described. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based artificial synapses can significantly impact the fields of neuromorphic bionics, biometrics, and biosensing.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and function of bacteria within tumors, highlighting their significance in cancer development and treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, advancements in microbial sequencing technology have sparked an increasing interest in the bacteria residing within solid tumors and its distribution and functions in various tumors. Intratumoral bacteria critically modulate tumor oncogenesis and development through DNA damage induction, chronic inflammation, epigenetic alterations, and metabolic and immune regulation, while also influencing cancer treatment efficacy by affecting drug metabolism. In response to these discoveries, a variety of anti&#8208;cancer therapies targeting these microorganisms have emerged. These approaches encompass oncolytic therapy utilizing tumor&#8208;associated bacteria, the design of biomaterials based on intratumoral bacteria, the use of intratumoral bacterial components for drug delivery systems, and comprehensive strategies aimed at the eradication of tumor&#8208;promoting bacteria. Herein, this review article summarizes the distribution patterns of bacteria in different solid tumors, examines their impact on tumors, and evaluates current therapeutic strategies centered on tumor&#8208;associated bacteria. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for developing drugs that target these bacterial communities are also explored, promising new directions for cancer treatment.

         <title>Approaching Splendid Catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 Battery from the Theory to Practical Designing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>

Li&#8211;CO2 batteries are new promising energy storage technologies of the next generation. In order to design splendid catalysts for practical Li&#8211;CO2 battery, this review summarizes the possible Li&#8211;CO2 energy storage mechanisms and the advance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries in terms of composition, geometry, and phase. Ways toward practical applications are also presented for the first time.








Abstract
Lithium carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, noted for their high discharge voltage of approximately 2.8&#160;V and substantial theoretical specific energy of 1876&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, represent a promising avenue for new energy sources and CO2 emission reduction. However, the practical application of these batteries faces significant hurdles, particularly at high current densities and over extended cycle lives, due to their complex reaction mechanisms and slow kinetics. This paper delves into the recent advancements in cathode catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, with a specific focus on the designing philosophy from composition, geometry, and homogeneity of the catalysts to the proper test conditions and real&#8208;world application. It surveys the possible catalytic mechanisms, giving readers a brief introduction of how the energy is stored and released as well as the critical exploration of the relationship between material properties and performances. Specifically, optimization and standardization of test conditions for Li&#8211;CO2 battery research is highlighted to enhance data comparability, which is also critical to facilitate the practical application of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. This review aims to bring up inspiration from previous work to advance the design of more effective and sustainable cathode catalysts, tailored to meet the practical demands of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces with Enhanced De&#8208;Wettability and Durability: From Structural Designs to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces with repellency have shown great potential in the fields of biology, environment, energy, and catalysis. However, they currently encounter challenges in superior de&#8208;wettability and durability. This review summarizes the recent progress of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability via novel structural designs. Furthermore, potential applications of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability are reviewed.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces (LLSs) with dynamic repellency toward various pollutants (e.g., bacteria, oil, and ice), have shown enormous potential in the fields of biology, environment, and energy. However, most of the reported LLSs cannot meet the demands for practical applications, particularly in terms of de&#8208;wettability and durability. To solve these problems, considerable progress has been made in enhancing the de&#8208;wettability and durability of LLSs in complex environments. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the recent progress in LLSs, encompassing designed structures and repellent capabilities, as well as their diverse applications, offering greater insights for the targeted design of desired LLSs.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid-like surfaces with repellency have shown great potential in the fields of biology, environment, energy, and catalysis. However, they currently encounter challenges in superior de-wettability and durability. This review summarizes the recent progress of LLSs with enhanced de-wettability and durability via novel structural designs. Furthermore, potential applications of LLSs with enhanced de-wettability and durability are reviewed.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid-like surfaces (LLSs) with dynamic repellency toward various pollutants (e.g., bacteria, oil, and ice), have shown enormous potential in the fields of biology, environment, and energy. However, most of the reported LLSs cannot meet the demands for practical applications, particularly in terms of de-wettability and durability. To solve these problems, considerable progress has been made in enhancing the de-wettability and durability of LLSs in complex environments. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the recent progress in LLSs, encompassing designed structures and repellent capabilities, as well as their diverse applications, offering greater insights for the targeted design of desired LLSs. First, a detailed overview of the development of LLSs from the perspective of their molecular structural evolution is provided. Then highlight recent approaches for enhancing the dynamic de-wettability and durability of LLSs by optimizing their structural designs, including linear, looped, crosslinked, and hybrid structures. Later, the diverse applications and unique advantages of recently developed LLSs, including repellency (e.g., liquid anti-adhesion/transportation/condensation, anti-icing/scaling/waxing, and biofouling repellency) are summarized. Finally, Perspectives on potential innovative advancements and the promotion of technology selection to advance this exciting field are offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) are prioritized for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces present challenges that hinder their development. This review focuses on electron and lithium&#8208;ion transport mechanisms at these interfaces and summarizes interface modification strategies. By correlating carrier transport networks with battery performance, design principles are outlined for achieving selective carrier transport to better guide future practical applications.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) have been considered as the priority candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage system, due to their advantages in safety and energy density compare with conventional liquid electrolyte systems. However, the introduction of numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces results in a series of issues, hindering the further development of SSLIBs. Therefore, a thorough understanding on the interfacial issues is essential to promote the practical applications for SSLIBs. In this review, the interface issues are discussed from the perspective of transportation mechanism of electrons and lithium ions, including internal interfaces within cathode/anode composites and solid electrolytes (SEs), as well as the apparent electrode/SEs interfaces. The corresponding interface modification strategies, such as passivation layer design, conductive binders, and thermal sintering methods, are comprehensively summarized. Through establishing the correlation between carrier transport network and corresponding battery electrochemical performance, the design principles for achieving a selective carrier transport network are systematically elucidated. Additionally, the future challenges are speculated and research directions in tailoring interfacial structure for SSLIBs. By providing the insightful review and outlook on interfacial charge transfer, the industrialization of SSLIBs are aimed to promoted.

         <title>Asymmetric Atomic Dual&#8208;Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship between the asymmetric atomic dual sites and the CO2RR is reviewed. A timely reference for researchers engages in the design and development of photocatalyst to explore a promising approach for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways. Some perspectives are provided for achieving efficient and sustainable photocatalysis based on tailoring strategies, design of active sites, and future challenges.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed active sites in a photocatalyst offer unique advantages such as locally tuned electronic structures, quantum size effects, and maximum utilization of atomic species. Among these, asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites are of particular interest because their asymmetric charge distribution generates a local built&#8208;in electric potential to enhance charge separation and transfer. Moreover, the dual sites provide flexibility for tuning complex multielectron and multireaction pathways, such as CO2 reduction reactions. The coordination of dual sites opens new possibilities for engineering the structure&#8211;activity&#8211;selectivity relationship. This comprehensive overview discusses efficient and sustainable photocatalysis processes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on strategic active&#8208;site design and future challenges. It serves as a timely reference for the design and development of photocatalytic conversion processes, specifically exploring the utilization of asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways, here exemplified by the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites: Quantum Well Thickness Distribution and Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript elucidates the relationship between the structure and optoelectronic properties of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites (RDPs) and describes their carrier recombination behaviours. It highlights the importance of the QW thickness distribution in RDPs for achieving high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes and summarizes the latest advances in controlling the QW thickness distribution of RDPs.








Abstract
Reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites (RDPs), a large category of metal halide perovskites, have attracted considerable attention and shown high potential in the fields of solid&#8208;state displays and lighting. RDPs feature a quantum&#8208;well&#8208;based structure and energy funneling effects. The multiple quantum well (QW) structure endows RDPs with superior energy transfer and high luminescence efficiency. The effect of QW confinement directly depends on the number of inorganic octahedral layers (QW thickness, i.e., n value), so the distribution of n values determines the optoelectronic properties of RDPs. Here, it is focused on the QW thickness distribution of RDPs, detailing its effect on the structural characteristics, carrier recombination dynamics, optoelectronic properties, and applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes. The reported distribution control strategies is also summarized and discuss the current challenges and future trends of RDPs. This review aims to provide deep insight into RDPs, with the hope of advancing their further development and applications.

         <title>Engineered Enucleated Mesenchymal Stem Cells Regulating Immune Microenvironment and Promoting Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bioorthogonal chemistry to function in the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm are combined to develop an engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells (Cargocyte). Cargocytes can modulate the two most important immune cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, by reducing NETosis and decreasing M1 macrophages phenotype polarization to regulate immune microenvironment and promote wound healing.








Abstract
Persistent excessive inflammation caused by neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction in the wound bed leads to refractory response during wound healing. However, previous studies using cytokines or drugs often suffer from short half&#8208;lives and limited targeting, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, the enucleated mesenchymal stem cell is engineered by aptamer bioorthogonal chemistry to modify the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm as a novel delivery vector (Cargocyte) with accurate targeting and sustained cytokine secretion. Cargocytes can successfully reduce NETosis by targeting the nuclear chromatin protein DEK protein with aptamers and sustaining interleukin (IL)&#8208;4 expression to overcome the challenges associated with the high cost and short half&#8208;life of IL&#8208;4 protein and significantly prevent the transition of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in murine and porcine wound models and have powerful potential to improve wound immune microenvironments effectively. Overall, the use of engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells as a delivery system may be a promising approach for wound healing.

&lt;p&gt;Persistent excessive inflammation caused by neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction in the wound bed leads to refractory response during wound healing. However, previous studies using cytokines or drugs often suffer from short half-lives and limited targeting, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, the enucleated mesenchymal stem cell is engineered by aptamer bioorthogonal chemistry to modify the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm as a novel delivery vector (Cargocyte) with accurate targeting and sustained cytokine secretion. Cargocytes can successfully reduce NETosis by targeting the nuclear chromatin protein DEK protein with aptamers and sustaining interleukin (IL)-4 expression to overcome the challenges associated with the high cost and short half-life of IL-4 protein and significantly prevent the transition of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in murine and porcine wound models and have powerful potential to improve wound immune microenvironments effectively. Overall, the use of engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells as a delivery system may be a promising approach for wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the design of flexible molecular devices is presented here. The devices with patterned liquid metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes exhibit excellent charge transport performance and stable retention properties. Functional all&#8208;molecule&#8208;circuits including Boolean logic gates and rectifier circuits are achieved by the devices.








Abstract
Here, a unique crossbar architecture is designed and fabricated, incorporating vertically integrated self&#8208;assembled monolayers in electronic devices. This architecture is used to showcase 100 individual vertical molecular junctions on a single chip with a high yield of working junctions and high device uniformity. The study introduces a transfer approach for patterned liquid&#8208;metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes, enabling the creation of fully flexible molecular devices with electrical functionalities. The devices exhibit excellent charge transport performance, sustain a high rectification ratio (&gt;103), and stable endurance and retention properties, even when the devices are significantly bent. Furthermore, Boolean logic gates, including OR and AND gates, as well as half&#8208;wave and full&#8208;wave rectifying circuits, are successfully implemented. The unique design of the flexible molecular device represents a significant step in harnessing the potential of molecular devices for high&#8208;density integration and possible molecule&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Extended Surface Bands Enabled Lasing Emission and Wavelength Switch from Sulfur Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended surface band&#8208;enabled lasing emission has been realized from sulfur quantum dots. The reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain of sulfur quantum dots allows for the demonstration of lasing wavelength switching using a single inorganic gain material.








Abstract
The development of a lasing wavelength switch, particularly from a single inorganic gain material, is challenging but highly demanded for advanced photonics. Nonetheless, all current lasing emission of inorganic gain materials arises from band&#8208;edge states, and the inherent fixed bandgap limitation of the band&#8208;edge system leads to the inaccessibility of lasing wavelength switching from a single inorganic gain material. Here the realization of a single inorganic gain material&#8208;based lasing wavelength switch is reported by proposing an alternative lasing emission strategy, that is, lasing emission from surface gain. Previous efforts to achieve surface&#8208;gain&#8208;enabled lasing emission have been hindered by the limited gain volume provided by surface states due to the broad emission bandwidth and/or low emission efficiency. This challenge is overcome by introducing extended surface bands onto the surface of sulfur quantum dots. The extended surface bands contribute to a high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrow emission bandwidth, thereby providing sufficient gain volume and facilitating stimulated emission. When combined with whispering gallery mode microcavity, surface gain enabled lasing emission manifests an ultralow threshold of 8.3 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain, facilitated by molecular affinity, allows for the realization of the lasing wavelength switch from a single inorganic gain material.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanoribbon with Ultra&#8208;High Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Polarization Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the anisotropy of the ultra&#8208;wide bandgap semiconductor &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3, it can be prepared as a solar&#8208;blind UV detector and is intrinsically sensitive to polarized light without the need of polarizers. This &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8208;based detector has an ultra&#8208;high polarization ratio and is commercially viable. This suggests a new strategy for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarization detection and also provides promising solar&#8208;blind optical communication.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) detection plays a critical role in imaging and communication due to its low&#8208;noise background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and strong anti&#8208;interference capabilities. Detecting the polarization state of UV light can enhance image information and expand the communication dimension. Although polarization detection is explored in visible and infrared light, and applied in fields such as astrophysics and submarine seismic wave detection, solar&#8208;blind UV polarization detection remains largely unreported. This is primarily due to the challenge of creating UV polarizers with high transmittance, high extinction ratio, and strong resistance to UV radiation. In this study, it is discovered that the space symmetry breaking of the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8217;s b&#8211;c plane results in a significant optical absorption dichroic ratio. Leveraging &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8217;s high solar&#8208;blind UV response, a lensless solar&#8208;blind UV polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector, circumventing the challenges associated with solar&#8208;blind UV polarizers is designed. This photodetector exhibits an exceptionally high intrinsic polarization ratio under 254&#160;nm linearly polarized light, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than other reported nanomaterial&#8208;based polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Additionally, it demonstrates significant advantages in solar&#8208;blind UV imaging and light communication. This work introduces a novel strategy for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarization detection and offers a promising approach for solar&#8208;blind light communication.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Sensing Ionogels with Tunable Mechanical Properties and Environmental Stability for Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogels with a 3D supramolecular network can be constructed by cation&#8211;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding. The supramolecular ionogel possesses tunable mechanical properties, high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, high elasticity, and environmental stability. In addition, the ionogel can be used in flexible sensing and underwater communication transmission, demonstrating great potential in intelligent robots and wearable devices.








Abstract
Ionogels have garnered significant interest due to their great potential in flexible iontronic devices. However, their limited mechanical tunability and environmental intolerance have posed significant challenges for their integration into next&#8208;generation flexible electronics in different scenarios. Herein, the synergistic effect of cation&#8208;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding is leveraged to construct a 3D supramolecular network, resulting in ionogels with tunable modulus, stretchability, and strength, achieving an unprecedented elongation at break of 10&#160;800%. Moreover, the supramolecular network endows the ionogels with extremely high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, and high elasticity. Meanwhile, the high environmental stability and hydrophobic network of the ionogels further shield them from the unfavorable effects of temperature variations and water molecules, enabling them to operate within a broad temperature range and exhibit robust underwater adhesion. Then, the ionogel is assembled into a wearable sensor, demonstrating its great potential in flexible sensing (temperature, pressure, and strain) and underwater signal transmission. This work can inspire the applications of ionogels in multifunctional sensing and wearable fields.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells via Enhanced Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Minimized Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diffusion&#8208;regulated ternary structure containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors enhances the absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. By integration with wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcells, a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% is achieved in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The compatibility of perovskite and organic photovoltaic materials in solution processing provides a significant advantage in the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. However, additional recombination losses can occur during exciton dissociation in organic materials, leading to energy losses in the near&#8208;infrared region of tandem devices. Consequently, a ternary organic rear subcell is designed containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to enhance the absorption of near&#8208;infrared light. Simultaneously, a unique diffusion&#8208;controlled growth technique is adopted to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layer, thereby improving exciton dissociation efficiency. This innovation not only broadens the absorption range of near&#8208;infrared light but also facilitates the generation and effective dissociation of excitons. Owing to these technological improvements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells increased to 19.2%. Furthermore, a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcell is integrated with a narrow&#8208;bandgap organic rear subcell to develop a perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. Owing to the reduction in near&#8208;infrared energy loss, the PCE of this tandem device significantly improved, reaching 24.5%.

By integration with wide-bandgap perovskite front subcells, a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% is achieved in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compatibility of perovskite and organic photovoltaic materials in solution processing provides a significant advantage in the fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. However, additional recombination losses can occur during exciton dissociation in organic materials, leading to energy losses in the near-infrared region of tandem devices. Consequently, a ternary organic rear subcell is designed containing two narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors to enhance the absorption of near-infrared light. Simultaneously, a unique diffusion-controlled growth technique is adopted to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layer, thereby improving exciton dissociation efficiency. This innovation not only broadens the absorption range of near-infrared light but also facilitates the generation and effective dissociation of excitons. Owing to these technological improvements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells increased to 19.2%. Furthermore, a wide-bandgap perovskite front subcell is integrated with a narrow-bandgap organic rear subcell to develop a perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. Owing to the reduction in near-infrared energy loss, the PCE of this tandem device significantly improved, reaching 24.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Near Infrared Independent Modulation of Hexagonal WO3 Induced by Ionic Insertion Sequence and Cavity Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three modes of &#8220;bright&#8221;, &#8220;cool&#8221;, and &#8220;dark&#8221; can be achieved by hexagonal WO3 through progressive ion intercalation and unique cavity optical characteristics. Additionally, it can also realize a broadband shielding effect from 550 to 2000 nm and a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, suggesting excellent practical applications value and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;band electrochromic materials have attracted significant attention due to their ability to independently control sunlight and solar heat. However, these materials generally exhibit notable limitations, and the mechanisms for their dual&#8208;band independent regulation remain poorly understood. Here, the visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;independent regulation capabilities of hexagonal WO3 (h&#8208;WO3) are introduced for the first time. A structure&#8208;activity relationship that perfectly&#160;links the microscopic ion insertion sequence and cavity characteristics to the macroscopic dual&#8208;band electrochromic properties is established. The progressive ion intercalation process and the distinctive optical activity of the cavities are keys for enabling h&#8208;WO3 to independently modulate &#8220;bright,&#8221; &#8220;cool,&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Notably, h&#8208;WO3 demonstrates superior dual&#8208;band electrochromic performance with a broadband full shielding effect from 550 to 2000&#160;nm, achieving the widest full shielding band in dual&#8208;band electrochromic studies. Additionally, h&#8208;WO3 shows a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, and requires only 49.1 and 209.7 mAh m&#8722;2 to complete a full round&#8208;trip switch between &#8220;bright&#8208;cool&#8221; and &#8220;bright&#8208;dark&#8221; modes, respectively. The constructed device offers a dynamic temperature control range of up to 10.5&#160;&#176;C and supports a maximum voltage of 2.86&#160;V, underscoring its considerable potential for practical applications and energy efficiency.

         <title>Advanced Materials for Energy Harvesting and Soft Robotics: Emerging Frontiers to Enhance Piezoelectric Performance and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review is focused on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezoelectric response of advanced materials, and to address scale&#8208;up and device integration challenges for complex systems and soft robotics. The working mechanisms and operation modes are highlighted for each material class, along with the application potential of piezoelectric perovskites, polymers, and biomaterials within device architectures.








Abstract
Piezoelectric energy harvesting captures mechanical energy from a number of sources, such as vibrations, the movement of objects and bodies, impact events, and fluid flow to generate electric power. Such power can be employed to support wireless communication, electronic components, ocean monitoring, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices. A variety of self&#8208;powered piezoelectric sensors, transducers, and actuators have been produced for these applications, however approaches to enhance the piezoelectric properties of materials to increase device performance remain a challenging frontier of materials research. In this regard, the intrinsic polarization and properties of materials can be designed or deliberately engineered to enhance the piezo&#8208;generated power. This review provides insights into the mechanisms of piezoelectricity in advanced materials, including perovskites, active polymers, and natural biomaterials, with a focus on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezo&#8208;response and facilitate their integration into complex electronic systems. Applications in energy harvesting and soft robotics are overviewed by highlighting the primary performance figures of merits, the actuation mechanisms, and relevant applications. Key breakthroughs and valuable strategies to further improve both materials and device performance are discussed, together with a critical assessment of the requirements of next&#8208;generation piezoelectric systems, and future scientific and technological solutions.

         <title>Mass Production of Multishell Hollow SiO2 Spheres With Adjustable Void Ratios and Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating transmissions and reactions. However, practical applications are severely hindered due to the high costs and low production efficiency. Herein, a precursor hydrolysis method is developed, which enables the cost&#8208;effective production of SiO2 MHSs on a large scale and adjusting on its void ratios.








Abstract
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) as supports have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating mass transport and chemical reactions. However, practical applications of SiO2 MHSs are severely hindered because of their high costs and low production efficiency issues. Herein, it is overcome these obstacles by developing a precursor hydrolysis method and demonstrate a cost&#8208;effective production of void&#8208;ratio tunable SiO2 MHSs on a large scale, which has a much lower cavitation temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) and one order of magnitude decrease in cost. In addition, the new method can also be applied to fabricate TiO2 and SnO2 hollow spheres (HSs). In particular, an NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy is developed to tune the pore diameters and pore distributions of SiO2 MHSs with different void ratios. SiO2 MHSs with varying void ratios and pore distributions have the broadest controlling release time ranges (30&#8211;430&#160;h). The precursor hydrolysis method and NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy offer adequate stimulus to push forward SiO2 MHSs from laboratory&#8208;scale to industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Advancing Heterogeneous Organic Synthesis With Coordination Chemistry&#8208;Empowered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution of coordination chemistry makes all the difference for single&#8208;atom catalytic organic synthesis. The relationship between the coordination structure and coordination effect of SACs and their action mode in organic synthesis is clarified. Current challenges and outlook are also described for potentially leading to the emergence of new catalytic insights.








Abstract
For traditional metal complexes, intricate chemistry is required to acquire appropriate ligands for controlling the electron and steric hindrance of metal active centers. Comparatively, the preparation of single&#8208;atom catalysts is much easier with more straightforward and effective accesses for the arrangement and control of metal active centers. The presence of coordination atoms or neighboring functional atoms on the supports' surface ensures the stability of metal single&#8208;atoms and their interactions with individual metal atoms substantially regulate the performance of metal active centers. Therefore, the collaborative interaction between metal and the surrounding coordination environment enhances the initiation of reaction substrates and the formation and transformation of crucial intermediate compounds, which imparts single&#8208;atom catalysts with significant catalytic efficacy, rendering them a valuable framework for investigating the correlation between structure and activity, as well as the reaction mechanism of catalysts in organic reactions. Herein, comprehensive overviews of the coordination interaction for both homogeneous metal complexes and single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic reactions are provided. Additionally, reflective conjectures about the advancement of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis are also proposed to present as a reference for later development.

         <title>Stable Seawater Electrolysis Over 10&#160;000&#160;H via Chemical Fixation of Sulfate on NiFeBa&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst that enabled chemical fixation of free SO42&#8211; by atomically dispersed Ba2+ and preferential electrostatic adsorption of SO42&#8211; on the electrode surface, resulting in unprecedented stability (&gt;10&#160;000&#160;h) at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
Although hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis combined with offshore renewable energy can significantly reduce the cost, the corrosive anions in seawater strictly limit the commercialization of direct seawater electrolysis technology. Here, it is discovered that electrolytic anode can be uniformly protected in a seawater environment by constructing NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst assisted with additional SO42&#8722; in the electrolyte. In experiments, the NiFeBa&#8208;LDH achieves unprecedented stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in both alkaline saline electrolyte and alkaline seawater. Characterizations and simulations reveal that the atomically dispersed Ba2+ enables the chemical fixation of free SO42&#8722; on the surface, which generates a dense SO42&#8722; layer to repel Cl&#8722; along with the preferentially adsorbed SO42&#8722; in the presence of an applied electric field. In terms of the simplicity and effectiveness of catalyst design, it is confident that it can be a beacon for the commercialization of seawater electrolysis technology.

         <title>Continuous Homogeneous Thin Liquid Film on a Single Cross&#8208;Shaped Profiled Fiber with High Off&#8208;Circularity: Toward Quick&#8208;Drying Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is achieved by using cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity. The asymmetric liquid film works synergistically with capillary effect to overcome PRI and maintains a homogeneous liquid film on a single fiber. Using such a facile strategy, quick&#8208;drying fabrics could be realized, offering new prospects for fluid coatings and functional textiles.








Abstract
Quick&#8208;drying fabrics, renowned for their rapid sweat evaporation, have witnessed various applications in strenuous exercise. Profiled fiber textiles exhibit enhanced quick&#8208;drying performance, which is attributed to the excellent wicking effect within fibrous bundles, facilitating the rapid transport of sweat. However, the evaporation process is not solely influenced by macroscopic liquid transport but also by microscopic liquid spreading on the fibers where periodic liquid knots induced by spontaneous fluidic instability significantly reduce the evaporation area. Here, a cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity, featured as multiple concavities along the fibrous longitude&#8208;axis, which enables the formation of a homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber without any periodic liquid knots, is developed. The high off&#8208;circularity cross&#8208;sections help overcoming Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability by tuning the Laplace pressure difference, further facilitated by capillary flow along the concave surface. The homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is responsible for maximizing the evaporation area, resulting in excellent overall evaporation capacity. Consequently, fabrics made from such fibers exhibit rapid evaporation behavior, with evaporation rates &#8776;50% higher than those of cylindrical fabrics. It is envisioned that profiled fibers may provide inspiration for the manipulating homogeneous liquid films for applications in fluid coatings and functional textiles.

         <title>Accurate Simulation for 2D Lubricating Materials in Realistic Environments: From Classical to Quantum Mechanical Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the simulation methods from classical to quantum mechanical ones for 2D lubricating materials in realistic environments and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing atomic and electronic mechanisms. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is proposed to try to provide more ways to reveal the friction mechanisms and guide the material design.








Abstract
2D materials such as graphene, MoS2, and hexagonal BN are the most advanced solid lubricating materials with superior friction and anti&#8208;wear performance. However, as a typical surface phenomenon, the lubricating properties of 2D materials are largely dependent on the surrounding environment, such as temperature, stress, humidity, oxygen, and other environmental substances. Given the technical challenges in experiment for real&#8208;time and in situ detection of microscopic environment&#8211;material interaction, recent years have witnessed the acceleration of computational research on the lubrication behavior of 2D materials in realistic environments. This study reviews the up&#8208;to&#8208;date computational studies for the effect of environmental factors on the lubrication performance of 2D materials, summarizes the theoretical methods in lubrication from classical to quantum&#8208;mechanics ones, and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing the lubrication mechanism at atomic and electronic level. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is also proposed to try to provide more ways to accurately reveal the friction mechanisms and reliably guide the lubricating material design. On the basis of current development, future prospects, and challenges for the simulation and modeling in lubrication with realistic environment are&#160;outlined.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for the Conversion of CO2 into High&#8208;Value C2+ Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent advancements in the synthesis and characterization of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs) utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic processes aimed at converting CO2 into valuable C2+ chemicals. It also provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of developing efficient ADCs for the synthesis of value&#8208;added CO2&#8208;based C2+ products.








Abstract
The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added chemicals with two or more carbons (C2+) is a promising strategy that cannot only mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions but also reduce the excessive dependence on fossil feedstocks. In recent years, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs), including single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and single&#8208;cluster catalysts (SCCs), emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 fixation reactions due to their unique properties, such as the maximum utilization of active sites, tunable electronic structure, the efficient elucidation of catalytic mechanism, etc. This review provides an overview of significant progress in the synthesis and characterization of ADCs utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 toward high&#8208;value C2+ compounds. To provide insights for designing efficient ADCs toward the C2+ chemical synthesis originating from CO2, the key factors that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity are highlighted. Finally, the relevant challenges and opportunities are discussed to inspire new ideas for the generation of CO2&#8208;based C2+ products over ADCs.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Thermosetting Resins: From Molecular Engineering to Intrinsically Multifunctional Customization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich structural diversity of bio&#8208;based raw materials open unprecedented opportunities for various types of functional thermosetting resins inaccessible in conventional petrochemical&#8208;based materials. Recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins in terms of environmental concerns and the desire for sustainable industrial practices. Beyond sustainability, utilizing the structural diversity of renewable feedstock to craft bio&#8208;based thermosets with customized functionalities is very worthy of expectation. There exist many bio&#8208;based compounds with inherently unique chemical structures and functions, some of which are even difficult to synthesize artificially. Over the past decade, great efforts are devoted to discovering/designing functional properties of bio&#8208;based thermosets, and notable progress have been made in antibacterial, antifouling, flame retardancy, serving as carbon precursors, and stimuli responsiveness, among others, largely expanding their application potential and future prospects. In this review, recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosets are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties. Examples are highlighted wherein functionalities are facilitated by the inherent structures of bio&#8208;based feedstock. Perspectives on issues regarding further advances in this field are proposed at the end.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the factors that affect the stability of anodes and discusses the corresponding strategies for prolonging the anode lifetime, including designing catalytic materials, electrolyte optimization, and electrolyzer design. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is a sustainable and economical approach that can mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Although various catalysts/electrodes with excellent activities have been developed for high&#8208;efficiency seawater electrolysis, their unsatisfactory durability, especially for anodes, severely impedes their industrial applications. In this review, attention is paid to the factors that affect the stability of anodes and the corresponding strategies for designing catalytic materials to prolong the anode's lifetime. In addition, two important aspects&#8212;electrolyte optimization and electrolyzer design&#8212;with respect to anode stability improvement are summarized. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes. Finally, perspectives on future investigations aimed at improving the stability of seawater electrolysis systems are outlined.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) based on 2D materials like graphene/boron nitride, pivotal for heat management in advanced electronics. Focusing on their structural attributes, properties, and applications, it differentiates from other reviews by emphasizing their developmental history, addressing critical challenges, and proposing solutions. Additionally, it introduces other 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs, providing insights for future advancements.








Abstract
The challenges associated with heat dissipation in high&#8208;power electronic devices used in communication, new energy, and aerospace equipment have spurred an urgent need for high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) to establish efficient heat transfer pathways from the heater (chip) to heat sinks. Recently, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and boron nitride, renowned for their ultrahigh basal&#8208;plane thermal conductivity and the capacity to facilitate cross&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;morphic structural design, have found widespread use as thermal fillers in the production of high&#8208;performance TIMs. To deepen the understanding of 2D material&#8208;based TIMs, this review focuses primarily on graphene and boron nitride&#8208;based TIMs, exploring their structures, properties, and applications. Building on this foundation, the developmental history of these TIMs is emphasized and a detailed analysis of critical challenges and potential solutions is provided. Additionally, the preparation and application of some other novel 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs are briefly introduced, aiming to offer constructive guidance for the future development of high&#8208;performance TIMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reversible Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Systems: From Hydrogen Carriers to Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are a novel approach for hydrogen storage with the merits of high hydrogen storage capacity, safety, and long&#8208;distance transportation. The recent significant advances of two components in one reversible LOHC system, namely as hydrogen carriers and catalysts, are summarized with comparatives. The current challenges and outlook of this promising technology are also described.








Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) have gained significant attention for large&#8208;scale hydrogen storage due to their remarkable gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC) and compatibility with existing oil and gas transportation networks for long&#8208;distance transport. However, the practical application of reversible LOHC systems has been constrained by the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of hydrogen carriers and the performances of associated catalysts in the (de)hydrogenation cycles. To overcome these challenges, thermodynamically favored carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, and catalytic procedures need to be developed. Here, significant advances in recent years have been summarized, primarily centered on regular LOHC systems catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including dehydrogenative aromatization of cycloalkanes to arenes and N&#8208;heterocyclics to N&#8208;heteroarenes, as well as reverse hydrogenation processes. Furthermore, with the development of metal complexes for dehydrogenative coupling, a new family of reversible LOHC systems based on alcohols is described that can release H2 under relatively mild conditions. Finally, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of LOHC technology are provided, emphasizing new resources for low&#8208;cost hydrogen carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, catalytic technologies, and application scenarios.

         <title>Designing Advanced Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Alloys by Controlling the Energy State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to the modification of composition and structure, the functional properties of amorphous alloys can be improved by changing the energy state. For example, superior catalytic performance, soft magnetism, thermal stability, and magnetocaloric effect can be achieved by designing proper energy states. The correlation between the relaxuns of enthalpy and different properties is reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous alloys, also known as metallic glasses, exhibit many advanced mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, their energy states can vary over a wide range. However, the energy relaxation kinetics are very complex and composed of various types that are coupled with each other. This makes it challenging to control the energy state precisely and to study the energy&#8208;properties relationship. This brief review introduces the recent progresses on studying the enthalpy relaxation kinetics during isothermal annealing, for example, the observation of two&#8208;step relaxation phenomenon, the detection of relaxation unit (relaxun), the key role of large activation entropy in triggering memory effect, the influence of glass energy state on nanocrystallization. Based on the above knowledge, a new strategy is proposed to design a series of amorphous alloys and their composites consisting of nanocrystals and glass matrix with superior functional properties by precisely controlling the nonequilibrium energy states. As the typical examples, Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with both advanced soft magnetism and good plasticity, Gd&#8208;based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites with large magnetocaloric effect, and Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with high catalytic performance are specifically described.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically summarizes recent representative studies on catalytic membranes (CMs) for advanced water remediation, paying attention to both thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics mechanism. A rational design framework of tempospatially confined CM is proposed initiatively, involving the materials selection, catalytic oxidation system selection, pore microstructure design according to the tempospatial confinement, CM fabrication, and application.








Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitate efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application is practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation are critically reviewed and the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs is proposed. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, after which the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer are emphasized, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes are summarized and an overview of their application and performance evaluations is presented. Finally, future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment, are presented.

         <title>Superhydrophobic Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Thermal Materials Toward Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) featured with synergetic water&#8208;repellent, stable, and enhanced solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion properties, remarkably broaden the water&#8208;related application field. This review presents a timely introduction to the recent progress in synergetic functions, mechanisms, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium, providing general guidance for advancing future development of stable and high&#8208;efficient SSTMs.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion is a direct and effective way to absorb sunlight for heat via the rational design and control of photothermal materials. However, when exposed to water&#8208;existed conditions, the conventional solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal performance may experience severe degradation owing to the high specific heat capacity of water. To tackle with the challenge, the water&#8208;repellent function is introduced to construct superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) for achieving stable heating, and even, for creating new application possibilities under water droplets, sweat, seawater, and ice environments. An in&#8208;depth review of cutting&#8208;edge research of SSTMs is given, focusing on synergetic functions, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium. Moreover, the current challenges and future prospects based on SSTMs are also carefully discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired slippery surfaces, which originate in nature and possess unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion, have broad application prospects in liquid manipulation from tiny droplets to bulk liquid, such as water collection, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, drag&#8208;reduction, anti&#8208;icing, and anticorrosion.








Abstract
Slippery surfaces, which originate in nature with special wettability, have attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and practical applications in a variety of fields due to their unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion. Although research on bioinspired slippery surfaces is still in its infancy, it is a rapidly growing and enormously promising field. Herein, a systematic review of recent progress in bioinspired slippery surfaces, beginning with a brief introduction of several typical creatures with slippery property in nature, is presented. Subsequently,this review gives a detailed discussion on the basic concepts of the wetting, friction, and drag from micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;aspects and focuses on the underlying slippery mechanism. Next, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in three categories of slippery surfaces of air&#8208;trapped, liquid&#8208;infused, and liquid&#8208;like slippery surfaces, including materials, design principles, and preparation methods, are summarized and the emerging applications are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of various slippery surfaces are addressed.

         <title>Towards the 10&#8208;Year Milestone of Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have attracted significant attention for their potential to surpass the single&#8208;junction Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. This review highlights the milestones and advancements in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. It covers research progress and challenges, and provides a roadmap for developing efficient, scalable, and stable tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell represents one of the most promising avenues for exceeding the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells at a reasonable cost. Remarkably, its efficiency has rapidly increased from 13.7% in 2015 to 34.6% in 2024. Despite the significant research efforts dedicated to this topic, the &#8220;secret&#8221; to achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells seems to be confined to a few research groups. Additionally, the discrepancies in preparation and characterization between single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells continue to impede the transition from efficient single&#8208;junction to efficient tandem solar cells. This review first revisits the key milestones in the development of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the background, advancements, and challenges in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is provided, following the sequence of the tandem fabrication process. The progress and limitations of the prevalent stability measurements for tandem devices are also discussed. Finally, a roadmap for designing efficient, scalable, and stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is outlined. This review takes the growth history into consideration while charting the future course of perovskite/silicon tandem research.

         <title>2D Conjugated Polymer Thin Films for Organic Electronics: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, tailored electronic properties, and ordered structure have attracted extensive attention in organic electronics. This review summarises the recent advances in interfacial synthesis strategies, conductivity properties, and organic electronics applications of 2DCP thin films. Design principles and future research direction for full&#8208;conjugated 2DCP thin films for organic electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugated lattice and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with predesignability, well&#8208;defined channels, easy postmodification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics is summarized. Furthermore, it is shown that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with predesigned active groups, highly ordered structures, and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin&#8208;film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors. Finally, the future research directions and perspectives of 2DCPs are discussed in terms of the interfacial synthetic design and structure engineering for the fabrication of fully conjugated 2DCP thin films, as well as the functional manipulation of conductivity to advance their applications in future organic electronics.

         <title>From Charge to Spin: An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Electron Transfer in Energy Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive physical properties associated with charge and spin afford a novel paradigm for catalyst design, challenging conventional linear scaling relationships in the realm of energy conversion. This departure from traditional approaches not only holds the potential to revolutionize asymmetric synthesis but also offers a unique perspective on unraveling the elusive origins of homochirality.








Abstract
Catalytic materials play crucial roles in various energy&#8208;related processes, ranging from large&#8208;scale chemical production to advancements in renewable energy technologies. Despite a century of dedicated research, major enduring challenges associated with enhancing catalyst efficiency and durability, particularly in green energy&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, remain. Focusing only on either the crystal structure or electronic structure of a catalyst is deemed insufficient to break the linear scaling relationship (LSR), which is the golden rule for the design of advanced catalysts. The discourse in this review intricately outlines the essence of heterogeneous catalysis reactions by highlighting the vital roles played by electron properties. The physical and electrochemical properties of electron charge and spin that govern catalysis efficiencies are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the pronounced influence of external fields in perturbing the LSR, underscoring the vital role that electron spin plays in advancing high&#8208;performance catalyst design. The review culminates by proffering insights into the potential applications of spin catalysis, concluding with a discussion of extant challenges and inherent limitations.

         <title>DNA Nanomaterial&#8208;Empowered Surface Engineering of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As natural intercellular transporters, extracellular vesicles (EVs) show great potential as diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic agents, and drug delivery vehicles. DNA nanomaterials provide an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, programmable approach to design and construct sophisticated molecular devices on the EV surface for EV isolation, analysis, and delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell&#8208;secreted biological nanoparticles that are critical mediators of intercellular communication. They contain diverse bioactive components, which are promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Their nanosized membrane&#8208;bound structures and innate ability to transport functional cargo across major biological barriers make them promising candidates as drug delivery vehicles. However, the complex biology and heterogeneity of EVs pose significant challenges for their controlled and actionable applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Recently, DNA molecules with high biocompatibility emerge as excellent functional blocks for surface engineering of EVs. The robust Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing of DNA molecules and the resulting programmable DNA nanomaterials provide the EV surface with precise structural customization and adjustable physical and chemical properties, creating unprecedented opportunities for EV biomedical applications. This review focuses on the recent advances in the utilization of programmable DNA to engineer EV surfaces. The biology, function, and biomedical applications of EVs are summarized and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in EV isolation, analysis, and delivery based on DNA nanomaterials are introduced. Finally, the challenges and new frontiers in EV engineering are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have both excellent stability and continuously broken&#8208;through efficiencies. Herein, the characteristics of inverted PSCs including each functional layers, interfacial regulation strategies, and device stability are summarized. Meanwhile, the applications of inverted structure in tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules are introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and several proposals of PSCs are put forward.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transport layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal, and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>Advances in Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics: Flexible Transparent Electrodes and Deformable Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems. This work provides an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs. The recent advances in stretchable OPVs are elaborated, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices.








Abstract
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems owing to their superior robustness under repetitive tensile strains and their good compatibility. However, reconciling a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency and a reasonable flexibility is a tremendous challenge. In addition, the development of stretchable OPVs must be accelerated to satisfy the increasing requirements of niche markets for mechanical robustness. Stretchable OPV devices can be classified as either structurally or intrinsically stretchable. This work reviews recent advances in stretchable OPVs, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices. Initially, an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs is provided. Subsequently, research into flexible and stretchable transparent electrodes that directly affect the performances of stretchable OPVs is summarized and analyzed. Overall, this review aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of highly efficient and deformable active materials, while also emphasizing advanced strategies for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility of the active layer, including material design, multi&#8208;component settings, and structural optimization.

A brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) is of profound implications for restoring or augmenting human's capabilities. This review profiles the recent progresses on neuromorphic electronics with both energy&#8208;efficiency and bio&#8208;fidelity characteristics toward such interface. Challenges and prospects are also summarized, which can provide guidance for promoting the development of the seamless, bidirectional, and compact tools for bridging humans and machines.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable human&#8211;machine interaction have immense potential in restoring or augmenting human capabilities. Traditional BCIs are realized based on complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies with complex, bulky, and low biocompatible circuits, and suffer with the low energy efficiency of the von Neumann architecture. The brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) would offer a promising solution to advance the BCI technologies and shape the interactions with machineries. Neuromorphic devices and systems are able to provide substantial computation power with extremely high energy&#8208;efficiency by implementing in&#8208;materia computing such as in situ vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM) and physical reservoir computing. Recent progresses on integrating neuromorphic components with sensing and/or actuating modules, give birth to the neuromorphic afferent nerve, efferent nerve, sensorimotor loop, and so on, which has advanced the technologies for future neurorobotics by achieving sophisticated sensorimotor capabilities as the biological system. With the development on the compact artificial spiking neuron and bioelectronic interfaces, the seamless communication between a BNI and a bioentity is reasonably expectable. In this review, the upcoming BNIs are profiled by introducing the brief history of neuromorphics, reviewing the recent progresses on related areas, and discussing the future advances and challenges that lie ahead.

         <title>Targeting Compact and Ordered Emitters by Supramolecular Dynamic Interactions for High&#8208;performance Organic Ambient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact and ordered RTP emitters exhibit superior phosphorescent performance compared with disordered counterparts, thus greatly extending the applications. This review presents a timely introduction to the fundamental concepts and recent progress in design and preparation strategies, optical properties, underlying luminescent mechanisms and applications, providing general guidance for advancing future development of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.








Abstract
Purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received intense attention due to their fascinating optical properties and advanced optoelectronic applications. The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and minimalization of nonradiative dissipation under ambient conditions are key prerequisites for realizing high&#8208;performance organic RTP; However, the ISC process is generally inefficient for organic fluorogens and the populated triplet excitons are always too susceptible to be well stabilized by conventional means. Particularly, organizing organic fluorophores into compact and ordered entities by supramolecular dynamic interactions has proven to be a newly&#8208;emerged strategy to boost the ISC process greatly and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations immensely, facilitating the population and stabilization of triplet excitons to access high&#8208;performance organic RTP. Consequently, well&#8208;defined organic emitters enable robust RTP emission even in the solution state, thus greatly extending the applications. Here, this review is focused on a timely and brief introduction to recent progress in tailoring ordered high&#8208;performance RTP emitters by supramolecular dynamic interactions. Their typical preparation strategies, optoelectronic properties, and applications are thoroughly summarized. In the summary section, key challenges and perspectives of this field are highlighted to suggest potential directions for future study.

Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to single&#8208;atom catalysts. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis. Additionally, the overview discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving area of research.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural and its Downstream Chemicals: A Review of Catalytic Routes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass is crucial for sustainability, owing to its abundance and eco&#8208;friendliness. As a bio&#8208;based platform compound derived from sugar, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) enables the creation of high&#8208;value derivatives for further producing biopolymers, biofuels, and beyond. This review delves into efficient catalytic routes and economic feasibility of HMF synthesis and conversion, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.








Abstract
Biomass assumes an increasingly vital role in the realm of renewable energy and sustainable development due to its abundant availability, renewability, and minimal environmental impact. Within this context, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from sugar dehydration, stands out as a critical bio&#8208;derived product. It serves as a pivotal multifunctional platform compound, integral in synthesizing various vital chemicals, including furan&#8208;based polymers, fine chemicals, and biofuels. The high reactivity of HMF, attributed to its highly active aldehyde, hydroxyl, and furan ring, underscores the challenge of selectively regulating its conversion to obtain the desired products. This review highlights the research progress on efficient catalytic systems for HMF synthesis, oxidation, reduction, and etherification. Additionally, it outlines the techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and prospective research directions for the production of furan&#8208;based chemicals. Despite significant progress in catalysis research, and certain process routes demonstrating substantial economics, with key indicators surpassing petroleum&#8208;based products, a gap persists between fundamental research and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This is due to the lack of comprehensive engineering research on bio&#8208;based chemicals, making the commercialization process a distant goal. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of this field.

Abstract
The diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors have undergone significant advancements marked by a trend toward increased specificity and integration of imaging and therapeutic functions. The multifaceted nature of inorganic oxide nanomaterials (IONs), which boast optical, magnetic, ultrasonic, and biochemical modulatory properties, makes them ideal building blocks for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms. A promising class of materials that have emerged in this context are peptide&#8208;functionalized inorganic oxide nanomaterials (PFIONs), which have demonstrated excellent performance in multifunctional imaging and therapy, making them potential candidates for advancing solid tumor diagnosis and treatment. Owing to the functionalities of peptides in tumor targeting, penetration, responsiveness, and therapy, well&#8208;designed PFIONs can specifically accumulate and release therapeutic or imaging agents at the solid tumor sites, enabling precise imaging and effective treatment. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the use of PFIONs for the imaging and treatment of solid tumors, highlighting the superiority of imaging and therapeutic integration as well as synergistic treatment. Moreover, the review discusses the challenges and prospects of PFIONs in depth, aiming to promote the intersection of the interdisciplinary to facilitate their clinical translation and the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic systems by optimizing the material systems.

2D nanomaterials have layered structures and exhibit excellent physical barrier properties. By introducing corrosion inhibitors and/or chemical modifications, organic coatings can be endowed with excellent self&#8208;healing properties. Furthermore, highly conductive nanomaterials can boost the cathodic protection performance of zinc&#8208;rich coatings and extend the lifespan of organic coatings in marine environments.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials, with extraordinary physical and chemical characteristics, have long been regarded as promising nanofillers in organic coatings for marine corrosion protection. The past decade has witnessed the high&#8208;speed progress of 2D nanomaterial&#8208;reinforced organic composite coatings, and plenty of breakthroughs have been achieved as yet. This review covers an in&#8208;depth and all&#8208;around outline of the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances in 2D nanomaterial&#8208;modified organic coatings employed for the marine corrosion protection realm. Starting from a brief introduction to 2D nanomaterials, the preparation strategies and properties are illustrated. Subsequently, diverse protection models based on composite coatings for marine corrosion protection are also introduced, including physical barrier, self&#8208;healing, as well as cathodic protection, respectively. Furthermore, computational simulations and critical factors on the corrosion protection properties of composite coatings are clarified in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for marine corrosion protection based on 2D nanomaterials reinforced organic coatings are highlighted.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, which enables a direct and pollution&#8208;free conversion of heat into electricity, provides a promising path to address the current global energy crisis. Among the broad range of thermoelectric materials, silver copper chalcogenides (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) have garnered significant attention in thermoelectric community in light of inherently ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, controllable electronic transport properties, excellent thermoelectric performance across various temperature ranges, and a degree of ductility. This review epitomizes the recent progress in AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials, from the optimization of thermoelectric performance to the rational design of devices, encompassing the fundamental understanding of crystal structures, electronic band structures, mechanical properties, and quasi&#8208;liquid behaviors. The correlation between chemical composition, mechanical properties, and thermoelectric performance in this material system is also highlighted. Finally, several key issues and prospects are proposed for further optimizing AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

Abstract
Smart stimuli&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence materials, combining the various advantages and frontier applications prospects, have gained booming progress in recent years. The trap&#8208;controlled property and energy storage capability to respond to external multi&#8208;stimulations through diverse luminescence pathways make them attractive in emerging multi&#8208;responsive smart platforms. This review aims at the recent advances in trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials for advanced multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive smart platforms. The design principles, luminescence mechanisms, and representative stimulations, i.e., thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, mechano&#8208;, and X&#8208;rays responsiveness, are comprehensively summarized. Various emerging multi&#8208;responsive hybrid systems containing trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials are highlighted. Specifically, temperature dependent trapping and de&#8208;trapping performance is discussed, from extreme&#8208;low temperature to ultra&#8208;high temperature conditions. Emerging applications and future perspectives are briefly presented. It is hoped that this review would provide new insights and guidelines for the rational design and performance manipulation of multi&#8208;responsive materials for advanced smart platforms.

         <title>Binary&#8208;Cooperative Ultrathin Porous Membrane for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate framework (g&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles are synthesized by a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, and the resulting defect&#8208;free membranes are obtained via spin&#8208;coating and thermal treatment. The membrane is constructed with g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles and stacked cross&#8208;linking boundaries, which form dual channels with fast gas transport and molecular sieving. The membrane performance is stable under 3.0 MPa.








Abstract
The construction of ultrathin porous membranes with stable structures is critical for achieving efficient gas separation. Inspired by the binary&#8208;cooperative structural features of bones and teeth&#8212;composed of rigid hydroxyapatite and flexible collagen, which confer excellent mechanical strength&#8212;a binary&#8208;cooperative porous membrane constructed with gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (g&#8208;ZIFs), synthesized using a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, is proposed. The enlarged cavity size and flexible frameworks of the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles significantly improve gas adsorption and diffusion, respectively. After thermal treatment, the coordination structures forming rigid segments in the g&#8208;ZIF membranes appear at the stacked g&#8208;ZIF boundaries, exhibiting a higher Young's modulus than the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles, denoted as the flexible segments. The g&#8208;ZIF membranes demonstrate excellent tensile and compression resistances, attributed to the effective translation of binary&#8208;cooperative effects of rigidity and flexibility into the membranes. The resulting dual&#8208;aperture structure, composed of g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles surrounded by nanoscale apertures at the boundaries, yields a membrane with a stable CO2 permeance of 4834 GPU and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 90 within 3.0&#160;MPa.

         <title>Cascaded Heteroporous Nanocomposites for Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Passive Radiation Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded heteroporous nanocomposite films with multistage optical scattering exhibit excellent subambient radiative cooling performance, achieving an enhanced average emissivity of 96.5% within the atmospheric window and a high reflectivity of 97.3% in the sunlight spectra. Combined with phase transition properties, these films possess thermal dissipation and absorption capabilities, effectively counteracting thermal shocks in device heating systems.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for heat dissipation that does not consume energy. However, current radiative cooling materials can only exhibit subambient cooling under atmospheric conditions and struggle to process specific heat accumulation. Thus, a passive thermal regulation mechanism adapted to wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range applications is required to match device heating systems. Herein, a heteroporous nanocomposite film (HENF) with thermo&#8208;adaptive radiation cooling performance is reported. Compared to conventional porous cooling films with limited scattering efficiencies, the HENFs with multistage scattering have a strong emissivity of 96.5% (8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and a high reflectivity of 97.3% (0.3&#8211;2.5&#160;&#181;m), resulting in an ultrahigh cooling power of 114&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. In such HENFs, theoretical analyses have confirmed the spectrum management superiority of the heteroporous unit in terms of the scattering efficiency strength, with their cascading effect enhancing the overall film&#8208;cooling efficiency. The high mechanical performance, phase&#8208;transition features, and environmental adaptive properties of HENFs are also exhibited. Importantly, HENFs synergistically couple thermal dissipation and absorption to effectively process heat accumulation and counteract thermal shock in heating devices. It is anticipated that thermo&#8208;adaptive HENFs will act as a promising platform for device surface thermal regulation over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Shape Memory Cryogel for Hemorrhage Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the call for eco&#8208;friendly healthcare solutions rises, the novel, energy&#8208;efficient biosafe pollen cryogels answer the call&#8208;crafted without toxic crosslinkers, they offer impressive shape&#8208;memory, strong mechanical resilience, and high biocompatibility. They stand out as a potential medical game&#8208;changer for healing deep, noncompressible wounds.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for sustainable manufacturing, motivated by concerns over energy conservation and carbon footprints, encounters challenges due to insufficient renewable materials and arduous fabrication procedures to fulfill specific requirements in medical and healthcare systems. Here, biosafe pollen cryogel is engineered as effective hemostats without additional harmful crosslinkers to treat deep noncompressible wounds. A straightforward and low&#8208;energy approach is involved in forming stable macroporous cryogel, benefiting from the unique micro&#8208;hierarchical structures and chemical components of non&#8208;allergenic plant pollen. It is demonstrated that the pollen cryogel exhibits rapid water/blood&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory properties within 2 s. Owing to their inherent nano/micro hierarchical structure and abundant chemical functional groups on the pollen surface, the pollen cryogel shows effective hemostatic performance in a mouse liver penetration model, which is easily removed after usage. Overall, the self&#8208;crosslinking pollen cryogel in this work pioneers a framework of potential clinical applications for the first&#8208;hand treatment on deep noncompressible wounds.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free nanowelding between 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductor nanoplates is achieved by perfectly aligning their crystalline orientations using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with the assistance of the anisotropic lubricity between the nanoplates and a graphene substrate.








Abstract
Nanowelding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom&#8208;designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, a new technique is reported based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

As-grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail-like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid-state qubits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Straightforward Solvent&#8208;Pair&#8208;Enabled Multicomponent Coassembly Approach toward Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Mesoporous Tungsten Oxide for Trace Ammonia Sensing</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (namely Pt/N&#8208;mWO3, Rh/N&#8208;mWO3, Pd/N&#8208;mWO3) are straightforwardly synthesized through a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly strategy. The obtained Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 materials have ordered mesoporous structure with ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles, rich oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces, exhibiting superior ammonia sensing performances with a low limit of detection (51.2 ppb).








Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated ordered mesoporous transition metal oxides remains a great challenge due to the difficulty of balancing the interactions between precursors and templates. Herein, a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly (SPEMC) strategy is developed for straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (abbreviated as NM/N&#8208;mWO3, NM&#160;=&#160;Pt, Rh, Pd). The amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS) copolymers coassemble with ammonium metatungstate (AMT) clusters and different kinds of hydrophilic noble metal precursors without phase separation. SPEMC synthesis requires no direct interaction between PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS and AMT, thus the assembly equilibriums between noble metal precursors and PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS can be readily controlled. The obtained NM/N&#8208;mWO3 nanocomposites possess ordered mesopores, abundant oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces. As a result, the Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensors exhibit superior ammonia sensing performances with high sensitivity, an ultralow limit of detection (51.2 ppb), good selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ammonia is oxidized stepwise to NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; during the sensing process. Moreover, a portable wireless module based on Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensor can recognize ppm&#8208;level concentration of ammonia, which lays a solid foundation for its application in various fields.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Artificial Spider Silk for Luminous Surgical Sutures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, the luminous artificial spider silks are prepared by employing highly hydrated segments and polyhydroxyl segments. Furthermore, a luminescent surgical suture is prepared by coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.








Abstract
The development of functional surgical sutures with excellent mechanical properties, good fluorescence, and high cytocompatibility is highly required in the field of medical surgeries. Achieving fibers that simultaneously exhibit high mechanical robustness, good spinnability, and durable fluorescence emission has remained challenging up to now. Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, this work reports a luminous artificial spider silk prepared with the aim of balancing the fiber spinnability and mechanical robustness. This is realized by employing highly hydrated segments with aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence for enhancing the fiber spinnability and polyhydroxyl segments for increasing the fiber mechanical robustness. Twist insertion during fiber spinning improves the fiber strength, toughness, and fluorescence emission. Furthermore, coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer results in a &#8220;sheath&#8211;core&#8221; architecture with improved mechanical properties and capacity to withstand water. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.

         <title>Extremely Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Unusual Axial Diamagnetism in a Quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall effect is observed in quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5. The obtained anomalous Hall conductivity is the largest one in the current anomalous Hall effect systems. Especially, the absence of magnetic elements makes La3MgBi5 one of the few non&#8208;magnetic materials that can exhibit anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in materials without magnetic elements. Here, a study of La3MgBi5 is presented, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although magnetic elements are absent in La3MgBi5, the signals of AHE can be observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large, reaching 42,356 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8%, the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry curvature. Another unique property discovered in La3MgBi5 is the axial diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of the restricted motion of the Dirac fermion at the Fermi level. These findings not only establish La3MgBi5 as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport but also indicate the great potential of 315&#8208;type Bi&#8208;based materials for exploring novel physical&#160;properties.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS2. Consequently, spin&#8208;dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS2, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.









Abstract
Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin&#8208;locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS2) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiNx) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS2 exciton emission with a spin&#8208;correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS2 exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin&#8208;dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley&#8208;polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Glass States Generated in a van der Waals Magnet by Alkali&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of TC from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy&#8208;hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>All&#8208;Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano&#8208;regions over a large area in SrCoO2.5 thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all&#8208;oxide metasurfaces.








Abstract
Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three&#8208;terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non&#8208;uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices. Designer metasurfaces formed in this way from SrCoO2.5 thin films display an anomalous optical reflection of light that relies on the uniform and coherent response of all the devices. Beyond oxides, almost any material whose properties can be controlled by the addition or removal of ions via gating can form novel metasurfaces using this technique. These findings provide insights into the electrokinetics of ionic gating and a wide range of applications using synchronized local ionic gating.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect Breaks the pH Dependence in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;distorted TiOxFy catalyst is developed with a strengthened pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, the microenvironment at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and consequently the absorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, leading to significant pH&#8208;resistant properties for two&#8208;electrode oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of small molecules (like O2 and CO2) often exhibits strong activity dependence on pHs because of discrepant proton donor environments. However, some catalysts can show seldom dependence on two&#8208;electron oxygen electroreduction, a sustainable route of O2 hydrogenation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this work, a pH&#8208;resistant oxygen electroreduction system arising from the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is demonstrated. Thorough operando Raman spectra, local environment analyses and density function theory simulations, the lattice distortion of TiOxFy that introduces the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect contributing to regulating local pHs at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and the absorption/desorption of key *OOH intermediate is revealed. Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiOxFy displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H2O2 yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further techno&#8208;economics analyses display the H2O2 production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.37&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multistate Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual triazatruxene (TAT) molecules forming a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.








Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step toward the realization of novel logic and memory devices. This paper reports on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. The low&#8208;bias switching behavior is explored in active units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules that are purposefully defined (programmed) by high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. Within such a unit the low&#8208;bias switching can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single TAT molecule, demonstrating up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled molecules, respectively. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to bias&#8208;dependent hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.

         <title>Boosting All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells by Revitalizing the Buried Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylcholine acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; aiding in the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly improving the overall quality of the top narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite layers. As a result, single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells and their 2&#8208;terminal tandems achieve stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 22.98% and 27.54%, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) serve as crucial top subcells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the prevalent use of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layers (HTLs) in NBG PSCs compromises device efficiency and stability. To address this, the study proposes a revitalizing strategy for the buried interface of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites by directly immersing acetylcholine chloride (ACh) into PEDOT: PSS. ACh acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; not only modulating the bottom PEDOT: PSS HTLs but also facilitating the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly enhancing the quality of the top perovskite layers. This intervention with ACh prevents Sn2+ oxidation, mitigates buried defects, and encourages the growth of large, densely packed grains within Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, the optimized NBG PSCs exhibit significantly improved hole transport and reduced carrier recombination, achieving a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 22.98% with enhanced stability. Furthermore, these optimized NBG Sn&#8208;Pb cells enable highly efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, boasting steady&#8208;state efficiencies of 27.54% (certified at 26.41%) and 28.01%, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing NBG PSCs through buried interface reconstruction, propelling the advancement of all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Printed All&#8208;Carbon Responsive Material and Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new carbon&#8208;based responsive material that unlocks the unexpectedly high vapor response speed of 9400&#176; s&#8722;1 as well as excellent enviroment tolerance. Based on this, an innovative somersaulting robot with locomotion velocity close to the level of animals is designed and constructed, representing a milestone towards achieving life&#8208;like performance in biomimetic soft robots.








Abstract
Responsive materials and actuators are the basis for the development of various leading&#8208;edge technologies but have so far mostly been designed based on polymers, incurring key limitations related to sensitivity and environmental tolerance. This work reports a new responsive material, laser&#8208;printed carbon film (LPCF), produced via direct laser transformation of a liquid organic precursor and consists of graphitic and amorphous carbons. The high activity of amorphous carbon combined with the dual&#8208;gradient structure enables the LPCF to have a actuation speed of 9400&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1 in response to the stimulus of organic vapor. LPCF exhibits a conductivity of 950&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 and excellent resistance to various extreme environmental conditions, which are unachievable for polymer&#8208;based materials. Additionally, an LPCF&#8208;based all&#8208;carbon soft robot that can mimic the complex continuous backward somersaulting motions without manual intervention is constructed. The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&#8722;1, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life&#8208;like performance.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

Supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents are achieved by the biaxial type halogen bonded complexation, which also appends light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine(III) have widely been utilized for organic synthetic reagents. They are also recognized as positive charge&#8208;assisted, exceptionally robust biaxial halogen bond donors, while their potential in supramolecular materials is barely explored. This work reports a cyclic diaryliodonium ion as biaxial halogen bonding donor that displays remarkable binding affinity toward phenanthroline or acridine acceptors with chiral pendants. Biaxial halogen bonding enables chiroptical evolution in solution, allowing for rational control over supramolecular chirality. Leveraging their strong binding affinity, the halogen bonding complexes manifested amorphous properties and deep eutectic behavior in the solid state. Capitalizing on these attributes, this work achieves the successful preparation of supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents. Additionally, halogen bonding appended light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Transport in the Injured Kidneys with Elevated Renal Function Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray imaging to track the kidney transport of renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles, the study finds that inner strip of outer medulla is the most significant site in accumulating glomerular filtered nanoparticles in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidney: formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the lumen of the loop of Henle increases as proximal tubular injury progresses, which is undetectable by renal function biomarkers BUN and creatinine in mild injury stages.








Abstract
Renal function biomarkers such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) serve as key indicators for guiding clinical decisions before administering kidney&#8208;excreted small&#8208;molecule agents. With engineered nanoparticles increasingly designed to be renally clearable to expedite their clinical translation, understanding the relationship between renal function biomarkers and nanoparticle transport in diseased kidneys becomes crucial to their biosafety in future clinical applications. In this study, renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as X&#8208;ray contrast agents to noninvasively track their transport and retention in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidneys with varying BUN and Cr levels. The findings reveal that AuNP transport is significantly slowed in the medulla of severely injured kidneys, with BUN and Cr levels elevated to 10 times normal. In mildly injured kidneys, where BUN and Cr levels only four to five times higher than normal, AuNP transport and retention are not predictable by BUN and Cr levels but correlate strongly with the degree of tubular injury due to the formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the Henle's loop of the medulla. These results underscore the need for caution when employing renal&#8208;clearable nanomedicines in compromised kidneys and highlight the potential of renal&#8208;clearable AuNPs as X&#8208;ray probes for&#160;assessing kidney injuries noninvasively.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Planar Polymer with Efficient &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer material with a planar imine&#8208;rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra&#8208;stable and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage capability. For real applications, an all&#8208;organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability. Although polymers with tunable molecular structures are ideal electrode materials, their unsatisfactory proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors hinder the practical application in APB devices. Herein, a novel planar phenazine (PPHZ) polymer with a robust and extended imine&#8208;rich skeleton is synthesized and used for APB application for the first time. The long&#8208;range planar configuration achieves ordered molecular stacking and reduced conformational disorder, while the high conjugation with strong &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization optimizes energy bandgap and electronic properties, enabling the polymer with low proton diffusion barriers, high redox activity, and superior electron affinity. As such, the PPHZ polymer as an electrode material exhibits fast, stable, and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors with a large capacity of 273.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 (1 C) in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is the highest value among proton&#8208;inserted electrodes in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Dynamic in situ techniques confirm the high redox reversibility upon proton uptake/removal, and the corresponding protonation pathways are elucidated by theoretical calculations. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type APB cell using PPHZ electrode exhibits an ultralong lifespan over 30&#160;000 cycles, further verifying its promising application prospect.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomesh Enables Cellular&#8208;Resolution, Elastic Neuroelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results presented here provide multifunctional materials, fabrication, and microsystem strategies establishing foundations for elastic neuroelectronics, where conventional thin&#8208;film&#8208;based electrode materials make stretchable microelectrodes through in&#8208;plane nanomesh structuring, achieving unparalleled scalability down to cellular resolution and reliable elasticity. Detailed in vivo studies suggest the ability of these devices to provide tissue&#8208;conforming, high&#8208;quality interfaces with individual neurons in intact nervous tissues.








Abstract
Silicone&#8208;based devices have the potential to achieve an ideal interface with nervous tissue but suffer from scalability, primarily due to the mechanical mismatch between established electronic materials and soft elastomer substrates. This study presents a novel approach using conventional electrode materials through multifunctional nanomesh to achieve reliable elastic microelectrodes directly on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone with an unprecedented cellular resolution. This engineered nanomesh features an in&#8208;plane nanoscale mesh pattern, physically embodied by a stack of three thin&#8208;film materials by design, namely Parylene&#8208;C for mechanical buffering, gold (Au) for electrical conduction, and Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for improved electrochemical interfacing. Nanomesh elastic neuroelectronics are validated using single&#8208;unit recording from the small and curvilinear epidural surface of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with device self&#8208;conformed and superior recording quality compared to plastic control devices requiring manual pressing is demonstrated. Electrode scaling studies from in vivo epidural recording further revealed the need for cellular resolution for high&#8208;fidelity recording of single&#8208;unit activities and compound action potentials. In addition to creating a minimally invasive device to effectively interface with DRG sensory afferents at a single&#8208;cell resolution, this study establishes nanomeshing as a practical pathway to leverage traditional electrode materials for a new class of elastic neuroelectronics.

         <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile approach is fully compatible with the lithography processes to create an atomically connected interface and effectively modulate the band alignment at the interface. This method is also generic for other materials and will ultimately result in the desirable requirements for topological and Andreev devices.








Abstract
Hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the integration of the properties of both materials, which relies on the interface details and the resulting coupling strength and wavefunction hybridization. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of the band alignment of the interface, as well as its tunability to the coupling and hybridization. Here, the interface is modified by inducing specific argon milling while maintaining its high quality, e.g., atomic connection, which results in a large induced superconducting gap and ballistic transport. By comparing with Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson calculations, it is proven that this method can vary the band bending/coupling strength and the electronic spatial distribution. In the strong coupling regime, the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co&#8208;tunneling&#8212;key ingredients for the Kitaev chain&#8212;are confirmed. This method is also generic for other materials and achieves a hard and huge superconducting gap in lead and indium antimonide nanowire (Pb&#8208;InSb) devices. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well&#8208;controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low&#8208;Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces vacancy&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H2 production efficiency under low&#8208;frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post&#8208;light absorption, significantly boosting H2 production.








Abstract
This study investigates the impact of In&#8208; and S&#8208;vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non&#8208;centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low&#8208;frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well&#8208;dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual&#8208;vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H2 evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge&#8208;separation efficiency, through multi&#8208;scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine&#8208;learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Defect Modification Through Oily&#8208;Allicin Modified Buried Interface Achieving Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oily Allicin is introduced into perovskite solar cells to achieve grain wrapping under different stressors, which promotes defect contact and prevents ionic migration. A power conversion efficiency of 25.07% with an FF (fill factor) of 84.03% is achieved, which reaches 93.16% of the FF S&#8211;Q limit.








Abstract
The buried interface properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. The metal&#8208;oxide/perovskite heterogeneous interfaces are highly defective and cause serious ion migration. However, the buried and unexposed bottom interface and simultaneous stabilization of grain boundaries receive less attention and effective solutions. To tackle this problem, a solid&#8211;liquid strategy is employed by introducing oily&#8208;additive allicin at the buried interface to passivate the shallow (VI and Vo) and deep traps (VPb and PbI). Interestingly, oily status allicin fills the pinholes at the heterointerface and wraps the perovskite grains, suppressing the ion migration during the photoaging process. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 25.07% is achieved with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 84.03%. The modified devices can maintain 94.51% of the original PCE after light soaking under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1000&#160;h. This work demonstrates a buried interface modification method that employs an eco&#8208;friendly additive, which helps promote the development of PSCs with high performance and stability.

         <title>Embedded Skyrmion Bags in Thin Films of Chiral Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first experimental observations of magnetic skyrmion bags embedded within skyrmion lattices in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe. By utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of embedded skyrmion bags, which remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields, is observed directly. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle&#8208;like properties. Earlier research has mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = &#8722;1. However, theoretical analyses of 2D chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags&#8212;solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe is shown. In particular, it is shown that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. The results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic&#160;solitons.

         <title>Automated Synthesis of DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the first automated, solid&#8208;phase synthesis of DNA nanomaterials is presented, achieved via the prototype DNA nanoassembler system. This methodology enables the production of sequence&#8208;controlled custom DNA nanotubes through self&#8208;assembly. Combining single&#8208;molecule kinetics and photobleaching experiments, microfluidic assembly, and automated data screening, the construction strategy relies on the sequential hybridization of DNA modules at room temperature onto a solid support.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized the ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA&#8208;based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, a fully automated method is reported to produce sequence&#8208; and size&#8208;defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX&#8208;tile&#8208;based DNA nanotubes and flexible wireframe DNA structures are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self&#8208;assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self&#8208;assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (through an ad&#8208;hoc developed K&#8208;means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single&#8208;molecule &#8220;assembly&#8208;analysis&#8208;optimization&#8221; sequence can be used to generate complex, noncovalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Electrocatalysts Base on Catalysis&#8208;Unit Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach is presented using catalysis units, simplifying material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to an assembly&#8208;like process. Through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML), a structure&#8208;performance relationship is established. Integration catalysis units into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrates Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work proposes a streamlined strategy, potentially integrating DFT, ML, and experimental section for efficient functional materials development.








Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of material candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units, is proposed and validated. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. First, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on a series of potential catalysis units that are possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) is employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterward, the projected catalysis units are integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirming that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for the design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

         <title>Controlled Migration of Lithium Cations by Diamine Bridges in Water&#8208;Processable Polymer&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Memory Layers for Organic Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming molecular bridges between water&#8208;soluble polymer chains widens chain distances leading to the reduced conductivity of lithium cations. This controlled migration of ions delivers pronounced hysteresis characteristics in organic transistors, which can mimic the action of biological synapses. The present organic synaptic transistors with the controlled ion migration layers can proceed with neural computing processes at an accuracy of 96%.








Abstract
Synaptic transistors require sufficient retention (memory) performances of current signals to exactly mimic biological synapses. Ion migration has been proposed to achieve high retention characteristics but less attention has been paid to polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs). Here, OSTRs with water&#8208;processable polymer&#8208;based SSEs, featuring ion migration&#8208;controllable molecular bridges, which are prepared by reactions of poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) are demonstrated. The ion conductivity of PSSA:LiOH:DETA (1:0.4:X, PLiD) films is remarkably changed by the molar ratio (X) of DETA, which is attributed to the extended distances between the PSSA chains by the DETA bridges. The devices with the PLiD layers deliver noticeably changed hysteresis reaching an optimum at X = 0.2, leading to the longest retention of current signals upon single/double pulses. The long&#8208;term potentiation test confirms that the present OSTRs can gradually build up the postsynaptic current by gate pulses of &#8722;2&#160;V, while the long&#8208;term depression can be adjusted by varying the depression gate pulses (&#8776;0.2&#8211;1.2&#160;V). The artificial neural network simulations disclose that the present OSTRs with the ion migration&#8208;controlled PLiD layers can perform synaptic processes with an accuracy of &#8776;96%.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Carrier&#8208;Dominant Transport in 2D Single&#8208;Crystal Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic nature of transport is presented by hole carriers in 2D copper without grain boundaries. Twin boundaries almost do not scatter electrons. The hidden hole&#8208;like properties of 2D copper can only be unmasked by thorough removal of grain boundaries. The existence of hole carriers is revealed in 2D copper through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and nonlinear Hall effect measurements.








Abstract
In 2D noble metals like copper, the carrier scattering at grain boundaries has obscured the intrinsic nature of electronic transport. However, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic nature of transport by hole carriers in 2D copper can be revealed by growing thin films without grain boundaries. As even a slight deviation from the twin boundary is perceived as grain boundaries by electrons, it is only through the thorough elimination of grain boundaries that the hidden hole&#8208;like attribute of 2D single&#8208;crystal copper can be unmasked. Two types of Fermi surfaces, a large hexagonal Fermi surface centered at the zone center and the triangular Fermi surface around the zone corner, tightly matching to the calculated Fermi surface topology, confirmed by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and vivid nonlinear Hall effects of the 2D single&#8208;crystal copper account for the presence of hole carriers experimentally. This breakthrough suggests the potential to manipulate the majority carrier polarity in metals by means of grain boundary engineering in a 2D geometry.

         <title>Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near&#8208;room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr3.








Abstract
CsPbBr3 exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large&#8208;area ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr3 in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy. This work paves the way for utilizing ferroelectric CsPbBr3 in novel optoelectronic devices, significantly expanding the potential of this material and opening doors for further exploration in this exciting field.

         <title>Memristive Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Probabilistic Graph Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) using Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors. C&#8208;PGM expresses uncertainties in graph data through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations, enabling fast processing and large&#8208;scale implementation of probabilistic units. This model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy in applications like steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm compared to conventional methods.








Abstract
Modern graph datasets with structural complexity and uncertainties due to incomplete information or data variability require advanced modeling techniques beyond conventional graph models. This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) utilizing Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors, which exhibit probabilistic switching, self&#8208;rectifying, and memory characteristics. C&#8208;PGM addresses the complexities and uncertainties inherent in structural graph data across various domains, leveraging the probabilistic nature of memristors. C&#8208;PGM relies on the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation across multiple memristive CBAs, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that rely on sequential operations, which are slower and have a reliability concern due to repeated switching. This new approach enables the fast processing and massive implementation of probabilistic units at the expense of chip area. In this study, the hardware&#8208;based C&#8208;PGM feasibly expresses small&#8208;scale probabilistic graphs and shows minimal error in aggregate probability calculations. The probability calculation capabilities of C&#8208;PGM are applied to steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm, which is implemented on a simulated large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PGM. The C&#8208;PGM&#8208;based steady&#8208;state estimation and PageRank algorithm demonstrate comparable accuracy to conventional methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno&#8208;Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno&#8208;free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell&#8208;adhesive properties as well as non&#8208;cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long&#8208;term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno&#8208;free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Piezoelectric Analgesia Blocks Cancer&#8208;Induced Bone Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This polyvinylpyrrolidone modified Aurivillius structure BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs) are synthesized via a hydrothermal process. Ultrasound can trigger BIONSs to generate local electrical field, internalizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) rapidly and substantially decreasing the expression of TRPV1. With the reduction of TRPV1, the Ca2+ signal in spinal neuron is obviously decreased and the activity of wide range dynamic neurons is inhibited, accompanying the reduction of some neuropeptides and the change of inflammatory cytokines, resulting cancer induced bone pain relief for up to 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The manipulation of cell surface receptors&#8217; activity will open a new frontier for drug development and disease treatment. However, limited by the desensitization of drugs, effective physical intervention strategy remains challenging. Here, the controllable internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on neural cells by local piezoelectric field is reported. Single&#8208;cell&#8208;level local electric field is construct by synthesizing piezoelectric BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs). Upon a mild ultrasound of 0.08&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, an electric field of 15.29&#160;&#181;V is generated on the surface of BIONSs, further inducing TRPV1 internalization in 5&#160;min. The as&#8208;downregulated TRPV1 expression results in the reduction of Ca2+ signal in a spinal neuron and the inhibition of the activity of wide range dynamic neurons, therefore effectively preventing the transmission of cancer&#8208;induced bone pain (CIBP). This strategy not only charts a new course for CIBP alleviation, but also introduces a promising nanotechnology for regulating cell surface receptors, showing significant potential in neuropathological and receptor&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Preferential Liquid Transport through the Intrinsic Pores of Cyclodextrin in Polyester Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl chloride crosslinked macrocyclic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyester nanofilm composite membranes result in membranes with high water permeance and superior ion&#8208;sieving capabilities. Polar aggregate pores in the nanofilm facilitate water permeation while the intrinsic cyclodextrin cavity does not contribute to liquid permeation, enabling selective permeation of polar liquids with extremely high permeance selectivity of &gt;500 and diminishes the existence of Janus pathways.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;&#8208;CD, demonstrating remarkable Na2SO4 rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), extremely low hexane permeance (&lt;1 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non&#8208;polar liquids flow through the &#946;&#8208;CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates for the first time the efficient generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy. This work quantifies the transport properties of the orbital currents from CoPt alloy and show that the performance of orbitronic terahertz emitters exceeds the spintronic counterpart. This work provides a new route for the developing orbitronic information devices.








Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, this work confirms that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital-to-charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light-induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters.

         <title>Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Local High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility issue of acetonitrile (AN) with lithium metal is tackled by introducing a novel approach&#8212;a locally high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent (LAT&#8208;0.5:1:2). The electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, flame retardancy, and wettability. Based on Cryo&#8208;EM characterization and theoretical simulations, the underlying mechanism of the AN&#8208;based LHCE from both the respects of solvation and SEI structures has been revealed.








Abstract
Acetonitrile (AN) is a compelling electrolyte solvent for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging batteries, but its reductive instability makes it incompatible with lithium metal anodes (LMAs). Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) is used as the diluent to build an AN&#8208;based local high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to realize dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable LMAs. Such LHCE exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability window close to 6&#160;V (vs Li+/Li), excellent wettability, and promising flame retardancy. Compared to a baseline carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, its electrochemical performance is prominent: the overpotential of lithium nucleation is minimal (only 24&#160;mV), the average half&#8208;cell coulombic efficiency (CE) reaches 99.5% at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and its practicality in full cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes is also demonstrated. Compounding factors are identified to decipher the superiority of the AN&#8208;based LHCE. From the respect of solvation structures, both the elimination of free AN molecule and the diluent separation would contribute to prevention of anodic AN decomposition. Based on cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) characterization and theoretical simulations results, the produced solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is uniform and compact. Thus, this work demonstrates a successful application of AN&#8208;based electrolytes in LMAs&#8212;traditionally deemed impractical&#8212;via the combined regulation of solvation and SEI structures.

         <title>Realization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Intrinsic Polar Metal in a Buckled Honeycomb Binary Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckled AB honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry belongs to polar space group P3m1, is proposed to be a promising candidate hosting topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity. Here, the successful realization of a IV&#8208;V binary compound on Ag (111) surface via molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. Strikingly, polarity and metallicity are found to coexist in the 2D buckled SiP monolayer.








Abstract
Structural topology and symmetry of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network play pivotal roles in defining its electrical properties and functionalities. Here, a binary buckled honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry, which naturally hosts topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity, is proposed. It is successfully achieved in a group IV&#8208;V compound, namely monolayer SiP epitaxially grown on Ag(111) surface. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the degeneration of the Dirac nodal lines to points due to the broken horizonal mirror symmetry is elucidated. More interesting, the SiP monolayer manifests metallic nature, which is mutually exclusive with polarity in conventional materials. It is further found that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity is strongly suppressed by the metallic substrate. This study not only represents a breakthrough of realizing intrinsic polarity in 2D metallic material via ingenious design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay of many exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phenomena.

         <title>Rational Design of Color&#8208;Pure Blue Organic Emitters by Poly&#8208;Heteroaromatic Omni&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;pure blue emitters are in great demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light emitting diodes displays. Here, a simple and clear concept to design such emitters is presented. The application of this concept allows to derive a new structural motif, which is used to synthesize novel color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant blue hue.









Abstract
Current research on organic light emitters which utilize multiple resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF)&#160;materials is gaining significant interest because of the materials&#8217; ability to efficiently generate color&#8208;pure blue emission. However, the underlying reasons for high color purity remain unclear. It is shown here that these emitters share a common electronic basis, which is deduced from resonance structure considerations following Clar's rule, and which is termed as &#8220;poly&#8208;heteroaromatic omni&#8208;delocalization&#8221; (PHOD). The simple and clear design rules derived from the PHOD concept allow extending the known chemical space by new structural motifs. Based on PHOD, a set of novel high&#8208;efficiency color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant deep&#8208;blue hue is specifically designed.

Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Shell&#8208;Less Indium Phosphide Quantum Dots Enabled by Atomistically Tailored Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP quantum dots demonstrate enhanced luminescence through atomic&#8208;level surface manipulation without shell structures. Concerns persist over core instability due to oxidation propensity and inevitable trap presence. However, utilizing Zn&#8208;oleate removes some traps, and with the addition of GaCl3, most traps are eliminated, achieving over 90% luminescence efficiency with the core alone.








Abstract
Contrary to the prevailing notion that shell structures arise from the intricate chemistry and surface defects of InP quantum dots (QDs), an innovative strategy that remarkably enhances the luminescence efficiency of core&#8208;only InP QDs to over 90% is introduced. This paradigm shift is achieved through the concurrent utilization of group 2 and 3 metal&#8208;derived ligands, providing an effective remedy for surface defects and facilitating charge recombination. Specifically, a combination of Zn carboxylate and Ga chloride is employed to address the undercoordination issues associated with In and P atoms, leading to the alleviation of in&#8208;gap trap states. The intricate interplay and proportional ratio between Ga&#8208; and Zn&#8208;containing ligands play pivotal roles in attaining record&#8208;high luminescence efficiency in core&#8208;only InP QDs, as successfully demonstrated across various sizes and color emissions. Moreover, the fabrication of electroluminescent devices relying solely on InP core emission opens a new direction in optoelectronics, demonstrating the potential of the approach not only in optoelectronic applications but also in catalysis or energy conversion by charge transfer.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>

A ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is reported for band engineering of PQD solids, which can form a gradient band structure within the PQD solids with substantially diminishes trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, significantly promoting the charge transport within the PQD solids. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQD solar cells give a remarkable efficiency of up to 16.44%.








Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments can firmly anchor to the PQD surface through the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

         <title>Designed Spin&#8208;Texture&#8208;Lattice to Control Anisotropic Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through control of thin&#8208;film boundary conditions, the magnetic texture present in antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 can be stabilized as a quasi&#8208;1D periodic lattice. This has important implications on spin&#8208;wave transport in the system, which is observed in this work through nitrogen&#8208;vacancy magnetometry imaging, nonlocal transport measurements, and a combination of finite&#8208;element and analytical calculations of the magnon dispersion.








Abstract
Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for future computing technologies due to their ultra&#8208;low energy dissipation and long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities. Multiferroic antiferromagnets, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), have an additional degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with the electric field. Unfortunately, spin&#8208;wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, long&#8208;range spin transport is explored within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable, 1D magnonic crystal. A striking anisotropy is discovered in the spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale theory and simulation suggest that this preferential magnon conduction emerges from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to electrically reconfigurable magnonic crystals in&#160;antiferromagnets.

         <title>Constructing Slip Stacking Diversity in Van der Waals Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings with angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies are constructed in low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals homobilayers via direct growth. Modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment are developed. The work unveils a unique epitaxy and offers a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.








Abstract
The van der Waals (vdW) interface provides two important degrees of freedom&#8212;twist and slip&#8212;to tune interlayer structures and inspire unique physics. However, constructing diversified high&#8208;quality slip stackings (i.e., lattice orientations between layers are parallel with only interlayer sliding) is more challenging than twisted stackings due to angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies between different slip stackings, sparsity of thermodynamically stable candidates and insufficient mechanism understanding. Here, using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers as a model system, this work theoretically elucidates that vdW materials with low lattice symmetry and weak interlayer coupling allow the creation of multifarious thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings, and experimentally achieves&#160;13 and 9 slip stackings in 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReS2 and 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReSe2 bilayers via direct growth, which are systematically revealed by atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), angle&#8208;resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. This work also develops modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries (GBs) and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a prominent dependence of the pressure&#8208;induced electronic band structure transition on stacking configurations. These studies unveil a unique vdW epitaxy and offer a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.

         <title>AI&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Powered Vehicle&#8208;Road Integrated Electronics for Intelligent Transportation Collaborative Perception</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is reported to improve the level of vehicle&#8208;road collaborative perception and autonomous driving cars. With the assistance of artificial intelligence models, SVRIE enhances the ability to recognize vehicle motion, road surface, and tire health condition, with a perception accuracy of more than 90%.








Abstract
Collaborative perception between a vehicle and the road has the potential to enhance the limited perception capability of autonomous driving technologies. With this background, self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is designed to play a dual role, including a SVRIE device integrated into vehicle tires and a SVRIE array embedded into a road surface. The pressure sensing capability and anti&#8208;crosstalk performance of the SVRIE array are characterized separately to validate the feasibility of applying the SVRIE in a cooperative vehicle&#8208;infrastructure system. It is demonstrated that the SVRIE based on the multi&#8208;layered fractal structure exhibits maximum performance in collaborative sensing and interaction between vehicles and road information, such as vehicle motion, road surface condition, and tire life cycle health monitoring. Traditional data analysis methods are often of questionable accuracy. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is used to classify the vehicle and road conditions with accuracy of at least 88.3%. The transfer learning model is constructed to enhance the road surface identification capabilities with 100% accuracy. The accuracies of the vehicle tire motion recognition and tire health monitoring are 97% and 99%, respectively. This work provides new ideas for collaborative perception between vehicles and roadsides.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Energy Loss and Volatilization of Formamidinium via Polymer&#8208;Assisted D&#8211;A supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Interface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.78% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>

A polymer&#8208;assisted 5FTPP/PCBM supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interface self&#8208;assembly strategy can minimize interfacial energy losses by addressing thermalization, conduction band offset, and nonradiative recombination, while inhibiting the adverse effect of FA+ volatilization under thermal stress by multidentate anchoring.








Abstract
2D perovskite passivation strategies effectively reduce defect&#8208;assisted carrier nonradiative recombination losses on the perovskite surface. Nonetheless, severe energy losses are causing by carrier thermalization, interfacial nonradiative recombination, and conduction band offset still persist at heterojunction perovskite/PCBM interfaces, which limits further performance enhancement of inverted heterojunction PSCs. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (5FTPP) is introduced between 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction and PCBM. Compared to tetraphenylporphyrin without electron&#8208;withdrawing fluoro&#8208;substituents, 5FTPP can self&#8208;assemble with PCBM at interface into donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) complex with stronger supramolecular interaction and lower energy transfer losses. This rapid energy transfer from donor (5FTPP) to acceptor (PCBM) within femtosecond scale is demonstrated to enlarge hot carrier extraction rates and ranges, reducing thermalization losses. Furthermore, the incorporation of polystyrene derivative (PD) reinforces D&#8211;A interaction by inhibiting self&#8208;&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of 5FTPP, while fine&#8208;tuning conduction band offset and suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination via Schottky barrier, dipole, and n&#8208;doping. Notably, the multidentate anchoring of PD&#8208;5FTPP with FA+, Pb2+, and I&#8722; mitigates the adverse effects of FA+ volatilization during thermal stress. Ultimately, devices with PD&#8208;5FTPP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.78% (certified: 25.36%), maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (65&#160;&#176;C) under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

Highly conductive anion exchange membrane (AEM) structures are identified from a pool of 180000 AEM variations through a trained fully connected neural network (FCNN) model. Under the guidance of machine learning, synthesized AEMs with anilinium cation domain facilitate the formation of continuous ion channels, showing potential applications in AEM&#8208;based energy devices.








Abstract
Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are vital for enabling the efficient and large&#8208;scale utilization of hydrogen energy. However, the performance of such energy devices is impeded by the relatively low conductivity of AEMs. The conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach to designing membrane structures has proven to be both inefficient and costly. To address this challenge, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model is developed based on acid&#8208;catalyzed AEMs to analyze the relationship between structure and conductivity among 180,000 AEM variations. Under machine learning guidance, anilinium cation&#8208;type membranes are designed and synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations and Mulliken charge population analysis validated that the presence of a large anilinium cation domain is a result of the inductive effect of N+ and benzene rings. The interconnected anilinium cation domains facilitated the formation of a continuous ion transport channel within the AEMs. Additionally, the incorporation of the benzyl electron&#8208;withdrawing group heightened the inductive effect, leading to high conductivity AEM variant as screened by the machine learning model. Furthermore, based on the highly active and low&#8208;cost monomers given by machine learning, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of anilinium&#8208;based AEMs confirms the potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an attempt is made to unveil the in situ evolution of Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs by using carbon nanofibers modified with CoOx as Li anode host, and 18O isotope tracing provides firm evidence of oxygen migration from CoOx to Li2O besides electrolyte decomposition. The as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly help improve the anode performance in half, symmetrical, and full cells.








Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which can show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and nonuniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) are successfully prepared as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, the role of CoOx during SEI evolution is elucidated, revealing that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore, the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode can exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Lanthanide Metallopolymer: Self&#8208;Healing and Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence for Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photosensitive photoluminescent metallopolymers with good mechanical properties and fast self&#8208;healing behaviors are successfully developed by incorporating spiropyran and terpyridine components into a unified lanthanide polymer structure. By adjusting the proportions of raw material, precise control over the stimulus response and luminescent color can be achieved. The obtained polymers have been applied for dynamic information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing, and Light&#8208;writing fields.








Abstract
Photoluminescent metallopolymers displaying photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are emerging as promising materials with versatile applications in photo&#8208;rewritable patterns, wearable UV sensors, and optical encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, integrating these materials into practical applications that require fast response times, lightweight qualities, fatigue resistance, and multiple encryption capabilities poses challenges. In this study, luminescent photochromic lanthanide (Ln) metallopolymers with rapid self&#8208;healing properties are developed by cross&#8208;linking terpyridine (Tpy)&#8208; and spiropyran (SP)&#8208; functionalized polyurethane chains through Ln&#8208;Tpy coordination bonds and H&#8208;bonds among polymer chains. The resulting products exhibit a range of intriguing features: i) photo&#8208;stimuli responsiveness using spiropyran monomers without additional dopants; ii) dual&#8208;emitting performance under UV&#8208;light due to Ln&#8208;Tpy and open&#8208;ring spiropyran moieties; iii) satisfactory mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing abilities from polymer chains; iv) multiple control switches for luminescence colors through photostimulation or feed ratio adjustments. Leveraging these attributes, the developed material introduces novel opportunities for light&#8208;writing applications, advanced information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing wearable devices, and insights into designing multifunctional intelligent materials for the future.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of nanoprobes for colorectal cancer imaging agents is carried out by developing Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT with a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (up to 12.3) and fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying), thus enabling successful recognition of the tumor boundary. This work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy in image&#8208;guided tumor resection.









Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometime suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, this work has designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

A novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded it into an F&#8208;2DP system by simple air&#8211;liquid interface method to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces between the interlayer and regulate the charge transfer along the intralayer to induce multilevel memory behavior for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing 2D polymer (F&#8208;2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F&#8208;2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine-containing 2D polymer (F-2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine-containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F-2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F-2DP film through self-complementary &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-electronic forces.

         <title>Positively Charged Hollow Co Nanoshells by Kirkendall Effect Stabilized by Electron Sink for Alkaline Water Dissociation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow cobalt&#160;(Co) nanoshells are formed via the Kirkendall effect and stabilized by conductive MoO2 pillars and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. The Co particles are positively charged on the surface which accelerates&#160;the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process.








Abstract
While cobalt (Co) exhibits a comparable energy barrier for H* adsorption/desorption to platinum in theory, it is generally not suitable for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of unfavorable water dissociation. Here, the Kirkendall effect is adopted to fabricate positive&#8208;charged hollow metal Co (PHCo) nanoshells that are stabilized by MoO2 and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. Compared to the zero&#8208;valent Co, the PHCo accelerates the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process. Alkaline HER occurs with a low overpotential of 59.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and first principles calculations reveal that the interfacial water to the PHCo sites and the accelerated proton transfer are conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, the upshifted d&#8208;band center of PHCo optimizes the adsorption/desorption of H*. This work provides a unique synthesis of hollow Co nanoshells via the Kirkendall effect and insights to water dissociation on catalyst surfaces with tailored charge states.

         <title>Unveiling Gating Behavior in Piezoionic Effect: toward Neuromimetic Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoionic hydrogels hold the potential to enable direct ionic gating of transistors. This research reveals that these hydrogels can exhibit gating behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, an analog to the mechanically gated phenomena observed in biological neurons. This breakthrough not only advances neuromimetic pressure sensors but also enhances fundamental understanding of the piezoionic mechanism.








Abstract
The human perception system's information processing is intricately linked to the nonlinear response and gating effect of neurons. While piezoionics holds potential in emulating the pressure sensing capability of biological skin, the incorporation of information processing functions seems neglected. Here, ionic gating behavior in piezoionic hydrogels is uncovered as a notable extension beyond the previously observed linear responses. The hydrogel can generate remarkably high voltages (700&#160;mV) and currents (7&#160;mA) when indentation forces surpass the threshold. Through a comprehensive analysis involving simulations and experimental investigations, it is proposed that the gating behavior emerges due to significant diffusion differences between cations and anions. To showcase the practical implications of this breakthrough, the piezoionic hydrogels are successfully integrated with prostheses and robot hands, demonstrating that the gating effect enables accurate discrimination between gentle and harsh touch. The advancement in neuromimetic tactile sensing has significant potential for emerging applications such as humanoid robotics and biomedical engineering, offering valuable opportunities for further development of embodied neuromorphic intelligence.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightly cross&#8208;linked alkyl acrylates can function as thermochromic materials with ultrahigh transparency and solar&#8208;modulating abilities via a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous polymer transition. When used as greenhouse materials or coupled with thermoelectric devices, the thermochromic layer is able to function as a thermal valve.








Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy&#8208;efficient windows being one of the primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>A Universal Biocompatible and Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte in p&#8208;Type and n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Complementary Circuits and Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.








Abstract
The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte, compatible with both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT&#8208;based complementary inverter with a record&#8208;high normalized&#8208;gain of 228 V&#8722;1 and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power&#8208;efficient implants.

         <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired material design method is presented to imitate the irregular structure of biological materials and obtain their outstanding mechanical properties. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, the method identifies distributions of fundamental building blocks and connectivity rules and generates synthetic equivalents with the same distributions. The method is demonstrated using the orange pericarp, known for protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities.








Abstract
As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical performances, like high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and good energy absorption. However, reproducing these irregular biological structures in synthetic materials remains a complex design and fabrication challenge. Here, a bioinspired material design method is presented that characterizes the irregular structure as a network of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, synthetic materials are generated with the same distributions of tiles and connectivity rules as the biological material and it is shown that these equivalent materials have structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships similar to the biological ones. To demonstrate the method, the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities is studied. Polymer samples are generated and characterized under quasistatic and dynamic compression and display spatially&#8208;varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, it is also determined how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

         <title>Manipulating Alkyl Inner Side Chain of Acceptor for Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the alkyl inner side chain of the small molecule acceptors assists in regulating molecular bandgap, energy levels, and intermolecular interaction, which is conducive to optimizing the trade&#8208;off among short&#8208;circuit current density, open&#8208;circuit voltage, and fill factor. Consequently, the optimal as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver top&#8208;ranked efficiencies of over 18%.








Abstract
As&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) possess tremendous potential for low&#8208;cost commercial applications. Herein, five small&#8208;molecule acceptors (A1&#8211;A5) are designed and synthesized by selectively and elaborately extending the alkyl inner side chain flanking on the pyrrole motif to prepare efficient as&#8208;cast devices. As the extension of the alkyl chain, the absorption spectra of the films are gradually blue&#8208;shifted from A1 to A5 along with slightly uplifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, which is conducive for optimizing the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuit current density and open&#8208;circuit voltage of the devices. Moreover, a longer alkyl chain improves compatibility between the acceptor and donor. The in situ technique clarifies that good compatibility will prolong molecular assembly time and assist in the preferential formation of the donor phase, where the acceptor precipitates in the framework formed by the donor. The corresponding film&#8208;formation dynamics facilitate the realization of favorable film morphology with a suitable fibrillar structure, molecular stacking, and vertical phase separation, resulting in an incremental fill factor from A1 to A5&#8208;based devices. Consequently, the A3&#8208;based as&#8208;cast OSCs achieve a top&#8208;ranked efficiency of 18.29%. This work proposes an ingenious strategy to manipulate intermolecular interactions and control the film&#8208;formation process for constructing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;cast devices.

         <title>Reactive Processing of Furan&#8208;Based Monomers via Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization for High Performance Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New monomers capable of frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization are identified through computational screening of thermostability and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization exotherms. Subsequent experimental validation of physical properties of monomers, kinetics, and material properties reveal frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization viability and promise in enabling energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing of 3D printed structures and gradient materials.








Abstract
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) presents an energy&#8208;efficient approach to produce high&#8208;performance polymers, typically utilizing norbornene derivatives from Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. This study broadens the monomer repertoire for FROMP, incorporating the cycloaddition product of biosourced furan compounds and benzyne, namely 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (HEN) derivatives. A computational screening of Diels&#8211;Alder products is conducted, selecting products with resistance to retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder but also sufficient ring strain to facilitate FROMP. The experiments reveal that varying substituents both modulate the FROMP kinetics and enable the creation of thermoplastic materials characterized by different thermomechanical properties. Moreover, HEN&#8208;based crosslinkers are designed to enhance the resulting thermomechanical properties at high temperatures (&gt;200&#160;&#176;C). The versatility of such materials is demonstrated through direct ink writing (DIW) to rapidly produce 3D structures without the need for printed supports. This research significantly extends the range of monomers suitable for FROMP, furthering efficient production of high&#8208;performance polymeric materials.

         <title>Complementary Multisite Turnover Catalysis toward Superefficient Bifunctional Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst is in situ constructed on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative interfaces and abundant multifunctional trimetal sites for seawater electrolysis, in which interfacial Mo sites are responsible for hydrogen evolution, while Co/Fe species facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics, thus cooperatively expediting bifunctional freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69 V, outperforming most of the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts.

The utilization of seawater for hydrogen production via water splitting is increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for the future. The key dilemma for seawater electrolysis is the incompatibility of superior hydrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;evolving activities at ampere&#8208;scale current densities for both cathodic and anodic catalysts, thus leading to large electric power consumption of overall seawater splitting. Here, in situ construction of Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 heterostructure arrays anchoring on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative catalytic interfaces and abundant multifunctional metal sites is reported, which serves as a robust bifunctional catalyst for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting at ampere&#8208;level current density. Operando Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory calculations corroborate that Mo and Co/Fe sites situated on the Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 multilevel interfaces optimize the reaction pathway and coordination environment to enhance water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption, thus cooperatively expediting hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in base. Inspiringly, this electrocatalyst can substantially ameliorate overall freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69&#160;V, along with superb long&#8208;term stability at 500&#8211;1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h, outperforming nearly all the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work offers a viable approach to design high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.

         <dc:description>
To advance high&#8208;quality imaging units in optoelectronic systems, a phototransistor that shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics is reported. Thanks to the programmable two&#8208;dimensional electron gas which can be modulated by drain/gate voltage inputs under different light exposure, a triplex photo&#8208;imaging functionality with capable of self&#8208;powering, photoconduction, and photo&#8208;synaptic operation is achieved, providing guidance toward system&#8208;on&#8208;chip photoelectric systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in the digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single&#8208;device platform are in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. Herein, an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure is reported, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEGs). Owing to the programmable feature of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs, with a particular capability of electron separation, collection and storage under different light illumination, the phototransistor shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8776;108&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 are achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage ability. The demonstration of three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Colossal Near&#8208;Field Radiative Heat Transfer Mediated by Coupled Polaritons with an Ultrahigh Dynamic Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area device near&#8208;field thermal radiation measurement system with in situ adjustable vacuum gap distances down to &lt;100&#160;nm is successfully established. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient of near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can reach unprecedented values with the help of coupled polaritons. The dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the strong coupling effect.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed the blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude owing to the tunneling evanescent waves. Exploiting this near&#8208;field enhancement holds significant potential for emerging technologies. It has been suggested that coupled polaritons can give rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of NFRHT. However, a thorough experimental verification of this phenomenon is still missing. Here this work experimentally shows that NFRHT mediated by coupled polaritons in millimeter&#8208;size graphene/SiC/SiO2 composite devices in planar plate configuration can realize about 302.8 &#177; &#8197;35.2&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the blackbody limit at a gap distance of 87&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.8&#160;nm. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient can reach unprecedented values of 0.136 WK&#8722;1 and 5440 Wm&#8722;2K&#8722;1. Additionally, a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical measurement, in conjunction with full&#8208;wave numerical simulations, provides further evidence for the coupled polaritonic characteristics of the devices. Notably, this work experimentally demonstrates dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the bias voltage, leading to an ultrahigh dynamic range of &#8776;4.115. This work ambiguously elucidates the important role of coupled polaritons in NFRHT, paving the way for the manipulation of nanoscale heat transport, energy conversion, and thermal computing via the strong coupling effect.

         <title>High&#8208;Lactate&#8208;Metabolizing Photosynthetic Bacteria Reprogram Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactate has emerged as a critical immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment, greatly impeding the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Hence, depriving lactate provides a favorable strategy to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). This research suggests that LAB&#8208;1 is capable of colonizing TIM and sustaining a long&#8208;term reduction in lactate concentration. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that lactate metabolism efficiently reprograms TIM.








Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) is considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. Here, a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) is selectively screened for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain&#8208;loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.








Abstract
Lung metastases are the leading cause of death among cancer patients. The challenges of inefficient drug delivery, compounded by a robust immunosuppressive microenvironment, make effective treatment difficult. Here, an innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) therapy is developed that integrates modified macrophages and engineered antitumor bacteria. These engineered macrophages, termed R&#8208;GEM cells, are designed to express RGD peptides on extracellular membranes, enhancing their tumor cell binding and intratumor enrichment. R&#8208;GEM cells are cocultured with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009, producing macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells). The intracellular bacteria maintain bioactivity for more than 24&#160;h, and the bacteria released from R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells within the tumor continue to exert bacteria&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. This is further supported by macrophage&#8208;based chemotaxis and camouflage, which enhance the intratumoral enrichment and biocompatibility of the bacteria. Additionally, R&#8208;GEM cells loaded with IFN&#947;&#8208;secreting strains (VNP&#8208;IFN&#947;) form R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells. Treatment with these cells effectively halts lung metastatic tumor progression in three mouse models (breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer). R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells vigorously activate the tumor microenvironment, suppressing tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;type macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs, and enhancing tumor&#8208;antagonizing M1&#8208;type macrophages, mature DCs, and Teffs. Du&#8208;EMME therapy offers a promising strategy for targeted and enhanced antitumor immunity in treating cancer metastases.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative dual-engineered macrophage-microbe encapsulation (Du-EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain-loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymyxin Mitigates Cytotoxicity and Reverses Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) is presented in the aqueous solution of antibiotics and adjuvants via dynamic covalent bonding. The resulting assemblies via RISA effectively mask the positive charge of polymyxins, preventing their interaction with negatively charged mammalian cells and reducing potential cytotoxicity, enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of polymyxins and preventing the emergence of further resistance.








Abstract
Polymyxins have been regarded as an efficient therapeutic against many life&#8208;threatening, multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacterial infections; however, the cytotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance associated with polymyxins have greatly hindered their clinical potential. Herein, the reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) of polymyxins and natural aldehydes in aqueous solution is presented. The resulting assemblies effectively mask the positively charged nature of polymyxins, reducing their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the representative PMBA4 (composed of polymyxin B (PMB) and (E)&#8208;2&#8208;heptenal (A4)) assemblies demonstrate enhanced binding to Gram&#8208;negative bacterial outer membranes and exhibit multiple antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased membrane permeability, elevated bacterial metabolism, suppression of quorum sensing, reduced ATP synthesis, and potential reduction of bacterial drug resistance. Remarkably, PMBA4 assemblies reverse drug resistance in clinically isolated drug&#8208;resistant strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in preventing and eradicating bacterial biofilms. PMBA4 assemblies efficiently eradicate Gram&#8208;negative bacterial biofilm infections in vivo and alleviate inflammatory response. This RISA strategy offers a practical and clinically applicable approach to minimize side effects, reverse drug resistance, and prevent the emergence of resistance associated with free polymyxins.

         <title>Suppressed Defects by Functional Thermally Cross&#8208;Linked Fullerene for High&#8208;Efficiency Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed tin&#8208;lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with ideal bandgap (1.2 eV) develop rapidly, while the top interface defects and Sn oxidation cannot be solved simultaneously. It is found cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) can coordinate with perovskite and optimize the interface and bulk of perovskite. This work demonstrates the optimization effect of C&#8208;PCBSD on perovskite interface and bulk.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have attracted the attention of the community due to their narrow bandgap, ideal for photovoltaic applications, especially tandem solar cells. However, the oxidation and rapid crystallization of Sn2+ and the interfacial traps hinder their development. Here, cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) is introduced during the quenching step of perovskite thin film processing to suppress the generation of surface defects at the electron transport layer interface and improve the bulk crystallinity. The C&#8208;PCBSD has strong coordination ability with Sn2+ and Pb2+ perovskite precursors, which retards the crystallization process, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and improves the perovskite bulk and surface crystallinity, yielding films with reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced interface charge extraction. Besides, the C&#8208;PCBSD network deposited on the perovskite surface displays superior hydrophobicity and oxygen resistance. Consequently, the devices with C&#8208;PCBSD obtain PCEs of up to 23.4% and retained 97% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of storage in a N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnet&#8208;Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n&#8208;GaAs via the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n&#8208;GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 








Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix l&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free SC spintronics.

         <title>Bipolar Textile Composite Electrodes Enabling Flexible Tandem Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.








Abstract
A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem&#8208;stacking configuration to yield high&#8208;voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid&#8208;state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE&#8208;based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding.

&lt;p&gt;A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE-based solid-state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem-stacking configuration to yield high-voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid-state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE-based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding. BTCE shows great promise for future safe, high-energy-density, and flexible SSLMBs for a wide range of flexible and wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retinomorphic Color Perception Based on Opponent Process Enabled by Perovskite Bipolar Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual perovskite absorber device in an antagonistic configuration is capable of generate bipolar responses with colors from the opponent pairs. Two variants (red&#8208;green and yellow&#8208;blue opponents) are fabricated, and filter&#8208;free machine color vision with high contrasts is demonstrated. The adaptation capabilities of the perovskite photodetector also ensure accurate color perception in different lighting conditions.








Abstract
The ability to perceive color by the retina can be attributed to both its trichromatic photoreceptors and the antagonistic neural wiring known as the opponent process. While neuromorphic sensors have been shown to demonstrate memory and adaptation capabilities, color perception is still challenging due to the intrinsic lack of spectral selectivity in narrow bandgap semiconductors. Furthermore, research on emulating neural wiring is severely lacking. The combination of halide perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap and a novel bipolar photodetector design emulates the efficiency of the retina in processing color information. The stimuli&#8208;responsive material is also responsible for maintaining partial color constancy&#8212;an adaptation feature. Leveraging the unique enhancement of color contrasts, an in&#8208;sensor data compression and edge detection can also be demonstrated. The color perception, chromatic adaptation, and color contrast enhancement make perovskite bipolar photodetectors a unique example where the sensor and neural wiring can be co&#8208;developed in conjunction.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels Crafted via Lignin&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel forms by diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, creating high&#8208;density crystalline domains and networks. This enhances mechanical properties (tensile strength: &#8776;20 Mpa, Young's modulus: &#8776;14 Mpa, toughness: &#8776;50 MJ&#160;m&#8315;3) and provides low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking (&#8776;100%). 









Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are typically assembled through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, posing a significant challenge in achieving ultra strength. Developing a higher strength based on molecular/nanoscale engineering concepts is a potential improvement strategy. Herein, a super&#8208;tough supramolecular hydrogel is assembled by gradually diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. Both simulations and analytical results indicate that the assembly and subsequent enhancement of the crosslinked network are primarily attributed to LS&#8208;induced formation and gradual densification of strong crystalline domains within the hydrogel. The optimized hydrogel exhibits impressive mechanical properties with tensile strength of &#8776;20&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of &#8776;14&#160;MPa, and toughness of &#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8315;3, making it the strongest lignin&#8208;PVA/polymer hydrogel known so far. Moreover, LS provides the supramolecular hydrogel with excellent low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking capability (&#8776;100%). Interestingly, the diffusion ability of LS is demonstrated for self&#8208;restructuring damaged supramolecular hydrogel, achieving 3D patterning on hydrogel surfaces, and enhancing the local strength of the freeze&#8208;thaw PVA hydrogel. The goal is to foster a versatile hydrogel platform by combining eco&#8208;friendly LS with biocompatible PVA, paving the way for innovation and interdisciplinarity in biomedicine, engineering materials, and forestry science.

         <title>Biometabolically Derived Selenium Nanoparticles Armed with Protein Protective Suit toward High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Se Batteries</title>

&#8220;Functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; bio&#8208;selenium nanoparticles are developed by Bacillus subtilis subsp.&#8217;s microbial metabolism process from toxic selenite (SeO32&#8722;), in which selenium nanoparticles are tightly encased in a natural biomembrane with rich functional groups containing nitrogen and phosphorus that effectively suppress shuttle effect and alleviate volume expansion, achieving superior electrochemical and structural stability.








Abstract
Selenium (Se) serves as a burgeoning high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of Se cathode is strictly limited by low Se utilization and inferior cycling stability arising from intrinsic volume expansion and notorious shuttle effect. Herein, a microbial metabolism strategy is developed to prepare &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules via Bacillus subtilis subsp. from selenite in sewage, in which Se nanoparticles are armed with a natural biological protein membrane with rich nitrogen and phosphorus, achieving the eco&#8208;efficient conversion of trash into treasure (selenite, SeO32&#8722; &#8594; Selenium, Se). The appealing&#8208;design &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules are beneficial to accommodate volume changes of Se in electrochemical reactions, confining polyselenides via chemisorption, and enhancing mechanical strength of electrode by associated bacteria debris, realizing comprehensive utilization of microorganism. By conceptualizing &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules, rather than artificial Se&#8208;host composites, as cathode for lithium&#8211;selenium batteries, it exhibits outstanding cycling stability and improved rate performance. This strategy opens the door to design smart electrode materials with unattainable structure that cannot be achieved by traditional approaches, achieving eco&#8208;efficient conversion of pollutants into energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials, which will be a promising research field for interdisciplinary of energy, biology, and environment.

         <title>Optimizing Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology via Solid Additive Strategy Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 19.50% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM) is constructed and optimized in the all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the use of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. Through subtly modifying the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene additives, improved molecular packing and well&#8208;defined DFMN are simultaneously realized, leading to a record efficiency of 19.50% for all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), in which the donor and the acceptor can self&#8208;assemble into a double&#8208;fibril structure, is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in organic solar cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that such DFNM can be constructed and optimized in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the assistance of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. It is revealed that the incorporation of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene can induce a stepwise regulation in the aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules during film casting and thermal annealing processes. Through altering the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene solid additives, both the intermolecular interactions and molecular miscibility with the host materials can be precisely tuned, which allows for the optimization of the molecular aggregation process and facilitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, and thus leading to reinforced molecular packing and optimized DFNM. As a result, an unprecedented efficiency of 19.50% (certified as 19.1%) is obtained for 2&#8208;ethoxynaphthalene&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT&#8208;X all&#8208;PSCs with excellent photostability (T80&#160;=&#160;1750&#160;h). This work reveals that the optimization of DFNM via solid additive strategy is a promising avenue to boosting the performance of all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1750&#160;h). This work reveals that the optimization of DFNM via solid additive strategy is a promising avenue to boosting the performance of all-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Sublattice Carrier Transition Enabled Polarimetric Photodetectors with Reconfigurable Polarity Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is proposed. By changing the gate voltage, the device exhibits reconfigurable PR values from positive to negative, covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Moreover, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is implemented. This work makes a conceptual advance in designing next&#8208;generation miniaturized highly polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Miniaturized polarimetric photodetectors based on anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials attract potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact polarimeters. However, these photodetectors are hindered by the small polarization ratio values and complicated artificial structures. Here, a novel polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is demonstrated. The unique periodic sublattice structure of CdSb2Se3Br2 features an in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition preferred along Sb2Se3 chains. Leveraging on the in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, gate voltage has an anisotropic modulation effect on the band alignment of heterostructure along sublattice. Consequently, the heterostructure exhibits a polarization&#8208;tunable photo&#8208;induced threshold voltage shift, which provides reconfigurable PR values from positive (unipolar regime) to negative (bipolar regime), covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Using this anisotropic photovoltaic effect, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is successfully implemented. This work provides a new platform for developing next&#8208;generation highly polarimetric optoelectronics.

         <title>Liquid Gallium&#8208;Assisted Pyrolysis of MOF Affording CNT Non&#8208;Hollow Frameworks in High Yields for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>

         <dc:description>
Liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis and subsequent acid treatment are cleverly used to obtain a high yield of O&#8208;rich carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow framework (NOCNTF&#8208;15) at relatively low temperatures. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental results mutually confirm that the NOCNTF&#8208;15 is a high capacity and ultralong life anode for SIBs.








Abstract
Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low&#8208;energy (600&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;yield (82&#160;wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O&#8208;containing groups gives a non&#8208;hollow framework composed of N/O&#8208;enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF&#8208;15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low&#8208;cost CNTs and other MOFs&#8208;derived carbon materials in high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

         <title>In situ Blending For Co&#8208;Deposition of Electron Transport and Perovskite Layers Enables Over 24% Efficiency Stable Conventional Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transport layer (ETL) materials have been rationally designed for in situ blending to co&#8208;deposit ETL and light&#8208;absorbing layers simultaneously in conventional perovskite solar cells. Such a strategy significantly improves the qualities of perovskite growth and buried interface to improve charge transport/collection. A record high power conversion efficiency over 24% is achieved for organic ETLs based devices.








Abstract
Simplifying the manufacturing processes of multilayered high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is yet of vital importance for their cost&#8208;effective production. Herein, an in situ blending strategy is presented for co&#8208;deposition of electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber by incorporating (3&#8208;(7&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraoxo&#8208;3,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo&#8208; [lmn][3,8]phenanthrolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;yl)propyl)phosphonic acid (NDP) into the perovskite precursor solutions. The phosphonic acid&#8208;like anchoring group coupled with its large molecular size drives the migration of NDP toward indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form a distinct ETL during perovskite film forming. This strategy circumvents the critical wetting issue and simultaneously improves the interfacial charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs based on in situ blended NDP achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.01%, which is one of the highest values for PSCs using organic ETLs. This performance is notably higher than that of ETL&#8208;free (21.19%) and independently spin&#8208;coated (21.42%) counterparts. More encouragingly, the in situ blending strategy dramatically enhances the device stability under harsh conditions by retaining over 90% of initial efficiencies after 250&#160;h in 100&#160;&#176;C or 65% humidity storage. Moreover, this strategy is universally adaptable to various perovskite compositions, device architectures, and electron transport materials (ETMs), showing great potential for applications in diverse optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reverse Hydrogen Spillover on Metal Oxides for Water&#8208;Promoted Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work unravels the water&#8208;effected mechanisms on the metal oxide surface during ethanol oxidation reactions through various in situ surface sensitive spectroscopies: i) the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites leads to water poisoning; ii) the proton&#8208;induced active *OOH species, achieved by accelerated reverse hydrogen spillover among metal oxides, enhances water&#8208;promoted functionality.








Abstract
Understanding the water&#8208;involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water&#8208;promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO&#8208;SnO2 imparts water&#8208;resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO2. The water&#8208;promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O2 activation on the SnO2 surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO&#8208;C&#8208;SnO2 showcases a remarkable 60&#8208;fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO2 under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the water-involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water-promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water-dissociated *OH species with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; imparts water-resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The water-promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation on the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C-H and C-C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO-C-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showcases a remarkable 60-fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under high-humidity conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Presodiation Agent Via Triggering Anionic Oxidation Activity in Sodium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Ni into specific Li sites within the Na2O framework tunes band structures, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion and accelerating the decomposition kinetics of Na2O. It can serve as a cathode presodiation agent to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycling; thus, enhancing the energy density of practical Na&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.








Abstract
Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) full&#8208;cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05&#9633;0.06)2O (Ni&#8211;Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni&#8211;O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8&#160;V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g&#8776;Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate &gt;80%). Incorporating currently&#8208;modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na&#8208;ion full&#8208;cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Further, not limited to Ni&#8211;Na2O, the structure&#8211;function relationship between the anionic oxidation mechanism and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface fabrication is revealed as a paradigm for the development of sacrificial cathode presodiation agent.

         <title>Homogeneous Fluorine Doping toward Highly Conductive and Stable Li10GeP2S12 Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;doped Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 possesses enhanced stability against moist air and lithium metal due to decreased H2O adsorption energy and formation energy of lithium vacancy, showing nearly one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of Li10GeP2S12 after air&#8208;exposure. The Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 monolayer solid electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of Li10GeP2S12 have gained extensive attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li10GeP2S12 is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The atomic&#8208;scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li10GeP2S12 is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li10GeP2S12. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li10GeP2S12 with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li10GeP2S12 system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiCoO2 | lithium all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability, showing 80.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile cryomicroneedle patch (CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for preserving the high activity of HMME and CAT in vitro and improving bioavailability in vivo, which enhances traceable PDT by O2 generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated GSH depletion.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy is further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT can be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveils the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrates distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>Embedding Biomimetic Vascular Networks via Coaxial Sacrificial Writing into Functional Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coaxial sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is used to embed biomimetic vascular networks into densely cellular matrices. These coaxially printed and perfusable hierarchical, branching vessels are composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds endothelialized lumens. Using co&#8208;SWIFT, vascularized cardiac tissues are constructed that exhibit synchronous beating, high contractility, and cardio&#8208;effective drug response.








Abstract
Printing human tissues and organs replete with biomimetic vascular networks is of growing interest. While it is possible to embed perfusable channels within acellular and densely cellular matrices, they do not currently possess the biomimetic architectures found in native vessels. Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle&#8208;laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co&#8208;SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio&#8208;effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ&#8208;specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.

         <title>Bidirectional, Multilayer MXene/Polyimide Aerogels for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. The monolayer bidirectional aerogel and its multilayer non&#8208;gradient structure exhibit wide effective absorption bandwidths of 8.58 and 9.41&#160;GHz, respectively.








Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Interstitial Boron Atoms in Pd Aerogel Selectively Switch the Pathway for Glycolic Acid Synthesis from Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdB alloy aerogel is synthesized as an anode catalyst for selective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion, achieving a peak mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1 and GA Faraday efficiency of 93.8%. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations uncover the ligand effect and oxophilicity enhancement originating from B incorporation synergistically regulate the adsorption and conversion of key intermediates, thereby allowing the highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable chemicals is garnering significant attention as it opens a mild avenue for waste resource utilization. However, achieving high activity and selectivity for valuable C2 products during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate on Pd electrocatalysts remains challenging. The strong interaction between Pd and carbonyl (*CO) intermediates leads to undesirable over&#8208;oxidation and poisoning of Pd sites, which hinders the highly efficient C2 products production. Herein, a nonmetallic alloying strategy is employed to fabricate a Pd&#8208;boron alloy aerogel (PdB), wherein B atoms are induced to regulate the electron structure and surface oxophilicity. This approach allows a remarkable mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1, glycolic acid (GA) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8%, and stable 100 h cyclic electrolysis. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal the contributions of B inserted in Pd lattice on highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. Interestingly, the heightened surface oxophilicity and regulated electronic structure by B incorporation weakened *CO intermediates adsorption and enhanced hydroxyl species affinity to accelerate oxidative *OH adspecies formation, thereby synergistically avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and boosting GA synthesis. This work provides valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GA synthesis via an oxophilic B motifs incorporation strategy.

Achieving both rich shape morphing and shape locking remains challenging in miniature soft actuators. Fully multi&#8208;material 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect are reported.

Abstract
Miniature shape&#8208;morphing soft actuators driven by external stimuli and fluidic pressure hold great promise in morphing matter and small&#8208;scale soft robotics. However, it remains challenging to achieve both rich shape morphing and shape locking in a fast and controlled way due to the limitations of actuation reversibility and fabrication. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect (SME) for programable fast shape morphing and shape locking, are reported. It combines commercial high&#8208;resolution multi&#8208;material 3D printing of stiff shape memory polymers (SMPs) and soft elastomers and direct printing of microfluidic channels and 2D/3D channel networks embedded in elastomers in a single print run. Leveraging spatial patterning of hybrid compositions and expansion heterogeneity of microfluidic channel networks for versatile hydraulically actuated shape morphing, including circular, wavy, helical, saddle, and warping shapes with various curvatures, are demonstrated. The morphed shapes can be temporarily locked and recover to their original planar forms repeatedly by activating SME of the SMPs. Utilizing the fast shape morphing and locking in the miniature actuators, their potential applications in non&#8208;invasive manipulation of small&#8208;scale objects and fragile living organisms, multimodal entanglement grasping, and energy&#8208;saving manipulators, are demonstrated.

         <title>Constructing Pd and Cu Crowding Single Atoms by Protein Confinement to Promote Sonogashira Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a convenient protein confinement strategy that tightly locates crowded&#160;Pd and Cu single atoms to promote the substrate activation and transmetallation in the Sonogashira reaction. These results provide important clues for the efficient construction of high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalysts with multiple neighboring active centers and&#160;achieving valuable organic transformations cocatalyzed by multiple active centers.








Abstract
For multicenter&#8208;catalyzed reactions, it is important to accurately construct heterogeneous catalysts containing multiple active centers with high activity and low cost, which&#160;is more challenging compared to homogeneous catalysts because of the low activity and spatial confinement of active centers in the loaded state. Herein, a convenient protein confinement strategy is reported to locate Pd and Cu single atoms in crowding state on carbon coated alumina for promoting Sonogashira reaction, the most powerful method for constructing the acetylenic moiety in molecules. The single&#8208;atomic Pd and Cu centers take advantage in not only the maximized atomic utilization for low cost, but also the much&#8208;enhanced performance by facilitating the activation of aryl halides and alkynes. Their locally crowded dispersion brings them closer to each other, which facilitates the transmetallation process of acetylide intermediates between them. Thus, the Sonogashira reaction is drove smoothly by the obtained catalyst with a turnover frequency value of 313 h&#8722;1, much more efficiently than that by commercial Pd/C and CuI catalyst, conventional Pd and Cu nanocatalysts, and mixed Pd and Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst.

     alt="Constructing Pd and Cu Crowding Single Atoms by Protein Confinement to Promote Sonogashira Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports a convenient protein confinement strategy that tightly locates crowded&#160;Pd and Cu single atoms to promote the substrate activation and transmetallation in the Sonogashira reaction. These results provide important clues for the efficient construction of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts with multiple neighboring active centers and&#160;achieving valuable organic transformations cocatalyzed by multiple active centers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multicenter-catalyzed reactions, it is important to accurately construct heterogeneous catalysts containing multiple active centers with high activity and low cost, which&#160;is more challenging compared to homogeneous catalysts because of the low activity and spatial confinement of active centers in the loaded state. Herein, a convenient protein confinement strategy is reported to locate Pd and Cu single atoms in crowding state on carbon coated alumina for promoting Sonogashira reaction, the most powerful method for constructing the acetylenic moiety in molecules. The single-atomic Pd and Cu centers take advantage in not only the maximized atomic utilization for low cost, but also the much-enhanced performance by facilitating the activation of aryl halides and alkynes. Their locally crowded dispersion brings them closer to each other, which facilitates the transmetallation process of acetylide intermediates between them. Thus, the Sonogashira reaction is drove smoothly by the obtained catalyst with a turnover frequency value of 313 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, much more efficiently than that by commercial Pd/C and CuI catalyst, conventional Pd and Cu nanocatalysts, and mixed Pd and Cu single-atom catalyst. The obtained catalyst also exhibits the outstanding durability in the recycling test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real&#8208;time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>Adhesion&#8208;Controlled Heterogeneous Nucleation of Tin Halide Perovskites for Eco&#8208;Friendly Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskites are regulated by incorporating CsF into the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer to adjust the adhesive strength of interfaces. As a result, FASnI2Br&#8211;CsF indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12%. Ultimately, the utilization of tin halide perovskite IPVs to power radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors is successfully explored.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the advancement of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) that directly power wireless IoT devices. The interest in lead&#8208;free perovskites for IPVs stems from their similar optoelectronic properties to high&#8208;performance lead halide perovskites, but without concerns about toxic lead leakage in indoor environments. However, currently prevalent lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs, especially tin halide perovskites (THPs), still exhibit inferior performance, arising from their uncontrollable crystallization. Here, a novel adhesive bonding strategy is proposed for precisely regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of THPs by introducing alkali metal fluorides. These ionic adhesives boost the work of adhesion at the buried interface between substrates and perovskite film, subsequently reducing the contact angle and energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high&#8208;quality THP films. The resulting THP solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.12% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs and successfully powering radio frequency identification&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Needle&#8208;Like Multifunctional Biphasic Microfiber for Minimally Invasive Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needle&#8208;like stretchable multifunctional microfiber for minimally invasive bioelectronics is developed, featuring a liquid metal core&#8208;nanocomposite shell structure. This design allows stiffness control based on phase transition and offers advantageous properties of both materials such as softness, stretchability, conductivity, and strain&#8208;insensitivity. Further functionalization enhances its biosensing and stimulation capabilities, showing promise for clinical translation across various in vivo applications.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics has attracted significant attention in electroceuticals and clinical medicine for precise diagnosis and efficient treatment of target diseases. However, conventional rigid implantable devices face challenges such as poor tissue&#8208;device interface and unavoidable tissue damage during surgical implantation. Despite continuous efforts to utilize various soft materials to address such issues, their practical applications remain limited. Here, a needle&#8208;like stretchable microfiber composed of a phase&#8208;convertible liquid metal (LM) core and a multifunctional nanocomposite shell for minimally invasive soft bioelectronics is reported. The sharp tapered microfiber can be stiffened by freezing akin to a conventional needle to penetrate soft tissue with minimal incision. Once implanted in vivo where the LM melts, unlike conventional stiff needles, it regains soft mechanical properties, which facilitate a seamless tissue&#8208;device interface. The nanocomposite incorporating with functional nanomaterials exhibits both low impedance and the ability to detect physiological pH, providing biosensing and stimulation capabilities. The fluidic LM embedded in the nanocomposite shell enables high stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitive electrical properties. This multifunctional biphasic microfiber conforms to the surfaces of the stomach, muscle, and heart, offering a promising approach for electrophysiological recording, pH sensing, electrical stimulation, and radiofrequency ablation in vivo.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Graphitization: The First Observation of Homogeneous Solid&#8208;State Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic graphitization is a simple and flexible route to graphitic carbons from biomass or organic precursors. Here, it is shown that the mechanism of graphitization involves a new type of catalysis where all components are in the solid state. This has broad implications in the important world of carbon but also more widely in materials science.








Abstract
Carbon is a critical material for existing and emerging energy applications and there is considerable global effort in generating sustainable carbons. A particularly promising area is iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization, which is the conversion of organic matter to graphitic carbon nanostructures by an iron catalyst. In this paper, it is reported that iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization occurs via a new type of mechanism that is called homogeneous solid&#8208;state catalysis. Dark field in situ transmission electron microscopy is used to demonstrate that crystalline iron nanoparticles &#8220;burrow&#8221; through amorphous carbon to generate multiwalled graphitic nanotubes. The process is remarkably fast, particularly given the solid phase of the catalyst, and in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to demonstrate that graphitization is complete within a few minutes.

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <title>Breaking the Saturation of Sensitivity for Ultrawide Range Flexible Pressure Sensors by Soft&#8208;Strain Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain&#8208;effect&#8208;based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1).








Abstract
The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade&#8208;off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity. Ascribed to the strain effect of sensing layers induced by interlaced microdomes, the sensors possess an increased sensitivity (5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1) over an ultrawide pressure range (45 Pa&#8211;4.1 MPa), a high&#8208;pressure resolution (5 Pa), fast response/recovery time (30/45 ms), and a robust response under a high&#8208;pressure loading of 3.5 MPa for more than 5000 cycles. These superior sensing performances allow the sensor to monitor large pressure. The flexible pressure sensor array can assist doctors in restoring the neutral mechanical axis, tracking knee flexion angles, and extracting gait features. Moreover, the flexible sensing array can be integrated into the joint motion surveillance system to map the balance medial&#8211;lateral contact forces on the metal compartments in real time, demonstrating the potential for further development into precise medical human&#8211;machine interfaces during total knee replacement surgery.

         <title>Interference of ATP&#8208;Adenosine Axis by Engineered Biohybrid for Amplifying Immunogenic Cell Death&#8208;Mediated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF) is rationally designed to activate immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;therapy and impede the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, which can establish a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity and activate the enduring immunological memory to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, thereby amplifying ICD&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) often results in the production and accumulation of adenosine (ADO), a byproduct that negatively impacts the therapeutic effect as well as facilitates tumor development and metastasis. Here, an innovative strategy is elaborately developed to effectively activate ICD while avoiding the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine. Specifically, ZIF&#8208;90, an ATP&#8208;responsive consumer, is synthesized as the core carrier to encapsulate AB680 (CD73 inhibitor) and then coated with an iron&#8208;polyphenol layer to prepare the ICD inducer (AZTF), which is further grafted onto prebiotic bacteria via the esterification reaction to obtain the engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF). Particularly, the designed Bc@AZTF can actively enrich in tumor sites and respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment to offload AZTF nanoparticles, which can consume intracellular ATP (iATP) content and simultaneously inhibit the ATP&#8208;adenosine axis to reduce the accumulation of adenosine, thereby alleviating adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and strikingly amplifying ICD effect. Importantly, the synergy of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (&#945;PD&#8208;1) with Bc@AZTF not only establishes a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity but also activates long&#8208;lasting immune memory effects to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, presenting a new paradigm for ICD treatment combined with adenosine metabolism.

         <title>An Electrolyte Engineered Homonuclear Copper Complex as Homogeneous Catalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) with a Cu atom proximal distance of 4.7 &#197; is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the lithium&#8211;sulfur redox reactions. The optimized content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaches the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T in electrolyte, further boosting its homogeneous optimization activity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries suffer from severe polysulfide shuttle, retarded sulfur conversion kinetics and notorious lithium dendrites, which has curtailed the discharge capacity, cycling lifespan and safety. Engineered catalysts act as a feasible strategy to synchronously manipulate the evolution behaviors of sulfur and lithium species. Herein, a chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the Li&#8211;S redox reactions. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T provides completely active sites and sufficient contact for homogeneously guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions, and stabilizing the lithium working interface according to the synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography, small angle neutron scattering and COMSOL results. Moreover, Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T with the content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaching saturated concentration in electrolyte further boosts the homogeneous optimization function in really operated Li&#8211;S batteries. Accordingly, the capacity retention of the Li&#8211;S battery is elevated from 51.4% to 86.3% at 0.2 C, and reaches 77.0% at 1.0 C over 400 cycles. Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1).

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;Capacity Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle is achieved in a tungsten(W)&#8208;introduced cathode through microstructure regulation. The modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries can effectively promote lithium ion&#160;transport and thus endow capacity enhancement. This work provides insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship for the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.

Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, it is demonstrated that an increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which can lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Enabled by Hollow Carbon Fibrous Electrodes with Reduced Graphitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2 ceramic nanofibers are employed as the catalytic template to fabricate hollow tubular N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanofibers, which has high tensile strength, robust structural flexibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. High K+&#8208;storage capacity at low plateau potential and fast K+&#8208;intercalation kinetics are achieved to build a flexible K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor.








Abstract
The large size of K+ ions (1.38 &#197;) sets a challenge in achieving high kinetics and long lifespan of potassium storage devices. Here, a fibrous ZrO2 membrane is utilized as a reactive template to construct a dual&#8208;carbon K&#8208;ion capacitor. Unlike graphite, ZrO2&#8208;catalyzed graphitic carbon presents a relatively disordered layer arrangement with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.378&#160;nm to accommodate K+ insertion/extraction. Pyridine&#8208;derived nitrogen sites can locally store K&#8208;ions without disrupting the formation of stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Consequently, N&#8208;doped hollow graphitic carbon fiber achieves a K+&#8208;storage capacity (primarily below 1&#160;V), which is 1.5 time that of commercial graphite. Potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors are assembled using the hollow carbon fiber electrodes and the ZrO2 nanofiber membrane as the separator. The capacitor exhibits a high power of 40 000 W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, full charge in 8.5&#8201;s, 93% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2&#8201;A g&#8722;1, and a low self&#8208;discharge rate of 8.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The scalability and high performance of the lattice&#8208;expanded tubular carbon electrodes underscores may advance the practical potassium&#8208;ion capacitors.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes into High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt is utilized to repair highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Consequently, upcycled materials can overcome the key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward &#8220;direct upcycling.&#8221; Herein, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6&#160;V, especially its fast charging capability at 15&#160;C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

Abstract
Ubiquitous anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials with a rapidly rising annual consumption (over 1010&#160;m2) can pose a serious environmental burden. Biobased cellulosic materials with birefringence offer attractive sustainable alternatives, but their scalable solvent&#8208;free processing remain challenging. Here, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure of preferred oriented cellulose, the strategy balances the contradiction between the strong confinement of long&#8208;range ordered structures and the molecular motility required for entropically&#8208;driven reconstruction. Equipped with customizable processing forms including mold&#8208;pressing, spinning, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, and blade&#8208;coating, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, self&#8208;healing efficiency (94.5%), recyclability, and biodegradability. Moreover, the diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The strategy is expected to provide references for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of cellulose and promote sustainable innovation in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting industry.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Visual&#8208;Respiratory Synapse as Multimodal Scene Recognition System with Oxidized&#8208;Vacancies MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse using monolayer vacancy&#8208;induced oxidized MXene is introduced, leveraging synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. Oxidized vacancies exhibit photocarrier trapping and hydroxyl preference, enabling environmental and multimodal neural network image recognition. This device promises advancements in intelligent interactive systems through enhanced sensory integration and responsive neural network functionalities.








Abstract
In the pursuit of artificial neural systems, the integration of multimodal plasticity, memory retention, and perceptual functions stands as a paramount objective in achieving neuromorphic perceptual components inspired by the human brain, to emulating the neurological excitability tuning observed in human visual and respiratory collaborations. Here, an artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse is presented with monolayer oxidized MXene (VRSOM) exhibiting synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. The VRSOM enables to realize facile modulation of synaptic behaviors, encompassing postsynaptic current, sustained photoconductivity, stable facilitation/depression properties, and &#8220;learning&#8208;experience&#8221; behavior.

     alt="Bioinspired Artificial Visual-Respiratory Synapse as Multimodal Scene Recognition System with Oxidized-Vacancies MXene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artificial visual-respiratory synapse using monolayer vacancy-induced oxidized MXene is introduced, leveraging synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. Oxidized vacancies exhibit photocarrier trapping and hydroxyl preference, enabling environmental and multimodal neural network image recognition. This device promises advancements in intelligent interactive systems through enhanced sensory integration and responsive neural network functionalities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of artificial neural systems, the integration of multimodal plasticity, memory retention, and perceptual functions stands as a paramount objective in achieving neuromorphic perceptual components inspired by the human brain, to emulating the neurological excitability tuning observed in human visual and respiratory collaborations. Here, an artificial visual-respiratory synapse is presented with monolayer oxidized MXene (VRSOM) exhibiting synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. The VRSOM enables to realize facile modulation of synaptic behaviors, encompassing postsynaptic current, sustained photoconductivity, stable facilitation/depression properties, and &#8220;learning-experience&#8221; behavior. These performances rely on the privileged photocarrier trapping characteristics and the hydroxyl-preferential selectivity inherent of oxidized vacancies. Moreover, environment recognitions and multimodal neural network image identifications are achieved through multisensory integration, underscoring the potential of the VRSOM in reproducing human-like perceptual attributes. The VRSOM platform holds significant promise for hardware output of human-like mixed-modal interactions and paves the way for perceiving multisensory neural behaviors in artificial interactive devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding
The anisotropic lubricity between two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting tin selenide nanoplates and a graphene substrate enables the motion of nanoplates strictly along the zigzag direction of graphene. A subsequential in situ annealing welds the nanoplates together and yields defect&#8208;free interfaces. More details can be found in article number 2312199 by Salvador Barraza&#8208;Lopez, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kai Chang, and co&#8208;workers.

Gold nanomaterials possess many appealing material properties, such as facile control over their size/shape and surface functionality, intrinsic chemical inertness yet with high biocompatibility, adjustable localized surface plasmon resonances, tunable conductivity, wide electrochemical window, etc. Such material attributes have been recently utilized for designing and fabricating soft bioelectronics and optoelectronics. This motivates to give a comprehensive overview of this burgeoning field. The discussion of representative tailor&#8208;made gold nanomaterials, including gold nanocrystals, ultrathin gold nanowires, vertically aligned gold nanowires, hard template&#8208;assisted gold nanowires/gold nanotubes, bimetallic/trimetallic gold nanowires, gold nanomeshes, and gold nanosheets, is begun. This is followed by the description of various fabrication methodologies for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as strain sensors, pressure sensors, electrochemical sensors, electrophysiological devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, optoelectronics, and others. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Rational Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the efficiency of 2D PSCs, focusing on component&#160;engineering, crystal&#160;structure and photovoltaic properties. The strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique and interface optimization, are systematically discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites are outlined to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
In the quest for durable photovoltaic devices, 2D halide perovskites have emerged as a focus of extensive research. However, the reduced dimension in structure is accompanied by inferior optical&#8208;electrical properties, such as widened band gap, enhanced exciton binding energy, and obstructed charge transport. As a result, the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lags significantly behind their 3D counterparts. To overcome these constraints, extensive investigations into materials and processing techniques are pursued rigorously to augment the efficiency of 2D PSCs. Herein, The cutting&#8208;edge delve into developments in 2D PSCs, with a focus on chemical and material engineering, as well as their structure and photovoltaic properties. The review starts with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the key evaluation criteria of 2D PSCs. Then, the strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique, and interface optimization, to simultaneously boost efficiency and stability are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance will be outlined.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial strategy has attracted increasing attentions due to its remarkable impact on synergistically optimizing carrier and phonon transport properties. This review overviews and defines five typical interstitials, including rattling, decoupling, interlayer, dynamic, and liquid interstitials. Their transport mechanisms in thermoelectric materials are thoroughly illustrated, and future development directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms are identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial, and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>

Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium&#8208;ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast&#8208;charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high&#8208;rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast&#8208;charging applications.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

Abstract
Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Liquid crystal (LC) is a self&#8208;organized soft matter with anisotropic molecular alignment. Due to the sensitivity to various external stimulations, LC has been considered as an emerging and appealing responsive building block to construct intelligent materials and advanced devices. Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
